1
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:10,800
good morning good afternoon good evening

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,679
uh thank you all for attending cactus

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,079
con and thank you in particular for

4
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,720
attending this session building a

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,400
ransomware incident response plan

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,880
a little bit about me uh my name is alan

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,199
liska i'm part of the recorded future

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,480
seashore team

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,400
um i'm also a

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,640
reluctant ransomware researcher if you

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,480
will um i research and i uh ransomware

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
and i've helped organizations recover

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
from uh from numerous ransomware attacks

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,920
uh you can follow me on twitter at you

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,960
allen

16
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:47,039
i'm also the author of the book

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,800
ransomware understand prevent recover

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
it's a

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,719
book came out in the last half of 2021

20
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,079
kind of going over the history of

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,879
ransomware where we are today

22
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,640
and uh what is going to be happening in

23
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,680
the future um i believe that the

24
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,520
organizers are giving away a few signed

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,680
copies so uh hopefully if you're

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,000
attending in person you're able to get

27
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,240
one

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,200
let's get started with the presentation

29
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,759
so i want to do a quick level set before

30
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,840
we jump into the topic at hand

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,920
um ransomware in 2021 was a little bit

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,960
weird

33
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,240
it appears

34
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,560
that ransomware attacks were way way up

35
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,159
you know obviously it depends on who you

36
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,560
talk to there's always the observability

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,640
problem in ransomware one organization

38
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,799
has one set of data one organization has

39
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,200
another set of data yeah it's one of

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,799
those things that's really funny if you

41
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,799
google how many ransomware attacks were

42
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,000
there in 2020 you'll get answers ranging

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,040
from the fbi saying that there were

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
400 ransomware attacks to status

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,119
statista which has the number at 304

46
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
million so the number of ransomware

47
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,880
attacks were somewhere between 2400 and

48
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,038
304 million in 2020 uh probably the same

49
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:12,000
in 2021 just again it depends on what

50
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,480
data you know researchers have access to

51
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,760
whether it's their own customer data

52
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,879
publicly reported data etc um

53
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,000
but there are some things we can

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
definitely report on so in 2021 we saw

55
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,560
uh 21 law enforcement actions taken away

56
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
against ransomware groups or those that

57
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,959
support the ransomware groups whether

58
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,800
that's the initial access brokers

59
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,280
whether it's um the cryptocurrency

60
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,879
exchanges that are used for laundering

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,959
money etc that's more than in the

62
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,680
previous four years combined uh there's

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,120
a real uh law enforcement effort uh to

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,080
go after ransomware actors unfortunately

65
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
it's a little bit like whack-a-mole you

66
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,920
knock one down and you know two more pop

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,000
up

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,599
that being said we do think it is having

69
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:58,400
some material impact in certain sectors

70
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,159
we saw a decline in the second half of

71
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:03,040
2021 of ransomware attacks against

72
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,959
health care providers against schools

73
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:07,280
and some of the critical infrastructure

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,280
on the other hand we saw a huge uptick

75
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,080
in attacks against manufacturing sector

76
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
against uh

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,400
targets in germany and france and other

78
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,200
parts of europe and as well as in asia

79
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,080
so

80
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
uh it may not be that ransomware attacks

81
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,080
are slowing down because of all these

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,560
arrests they just may be going for less

83
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,440
high profile targets uh we did see more

84
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,760
than 4 500 victims certain ransomware

85
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,159
extortion sites across all of 2021

86
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,440
that's a big jump over 2020. uh

87
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
only we only we think only think about

88
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,080
10 percent of ransomware victims are

89
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
posted to ransomware extortion sites so

90
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,560
you can extrapolate that now that

91
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,560
doesn't mean that ninety percent of

92
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,519
victims are paying um there's a whole

93
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,840
lot of reasons why data never gets

94
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,000
posted to ransomware extortion sites

95
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,599
some of the ransomware actors frankly

96
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,319
kind of suck and so they pull really bad

97
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,879
data and you can't

98
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
extort an organization with really bad

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,760
data

100
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:10,239
we did see the largest known ransom ever

101
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,760
paid by cna financial in may of 2021 so

102
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,439
40 million dollars

103
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,358
and then as you can see here's sort of

104
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,279
the

105
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:24,240
trajectory that we saw in 2021 of uh of

106
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,639
victims posted to ransomware extortion

107
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,000
sites

108
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,160
so you can see how that kind of goes

109
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,160
from early 2020 into 2021 and then just

110
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,440
kind of takes off from there

111
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,120
uh

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
and i know it's overused a lot now in uh

113
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,600
in infosec

114
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,240
but it really is true mike tyson has a

115
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
famous quote that says everyone has a

116
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
plan until they get punched in the mouth

117
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
and that includes your incident response

118
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,440
and disaster recovery plans

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,759
and unfortunately ransomware is the

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
ultimate punch in the mouth

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,960
you know

122
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,039
you can have a poor incident response

123
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
plan that can still deal with a lot of

124
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,960
different types of incidents but because

125
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,520
ransomware is so overwhelming and so uh

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
all-encompassing of your organization

127
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,759
it's really hard to hide flaws in your

128
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,600
incident response plan when you're

129
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,680
dealing with a ransomware attack and the

130
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
thing is many organizations think they

131
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,359
are prepared for a ransomware attack

132
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:32,800
um

133
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,199
you know in fact there's a great video

134
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,479
that's been going around for last few

135
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
weeks on twitter of um

136
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
uh uh of the scene out of uh movie and i

137
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,400
don't remember the name movie i

138
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,160
apologize of hitler talking to his cso

139
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,600
uh his uh or sorry the the

140
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,160
it's a scene from hitler um but

141
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
it you know they've got him labeled as

142
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,240
the cso and he's talking to the head of

143
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,000
threat intelligence out of the sock and

144
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,319
the head of the i.t department and

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:03,919
wondering how

146
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,319
a ransomware attack was able to happen

147
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,160
despite all the money and and everything

148
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
they've invested and that's you know the

149
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,039
way a lot of organizations think oh hey

150
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
we've invested in edr

151
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
we've invested in endpoint detection

152
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,759
and other types of endpoint detection we

153
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,800
have a next generation firewall um you

154
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,600
know we're doing ubi um you know so

155
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,720
we're we're

156
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
we're doing all of the things that we

157
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
need to do

158
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,560
in order to detect ransomware and then

159
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,360
the ransomware attack happens anyway um

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,880
and when they're hit they find out just

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,960
how unprepared they were

162
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
for this attack and they don't find out

163
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,759
until then unfortunately

164
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
so we have an hour today

165
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,120
um and trying to learn everything that

166
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,880
you can in order to put together an

167
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,880
incident response plan for a ransomware

168
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,759
attack

169
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,160
um in an hour is

170
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,199
not going to be possible what i want to

171
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
do is help you build a framework and

172
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
think about how you can better

173
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,280
build out an ins ransomware instant

174
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,240
response plan within your organization

175
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,960
so use this as kind of a guideline

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,560
um

177
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
within your organization to make

178
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,400
adjustments and so on i'll be in the

179
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,560
discord channel so if you want to chat

180
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,639
with me um while we're having this

181
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,479
conversation i'm more than happy to try

182
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
and answer any questions you have kind

183
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,420
of uh hopefully one-on-one

184
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,400
[Music]

185
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,840
let's start with the anatomy of a

186
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,479
ransomware attack um

187
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,800
and this is really important because

188
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,880
this is going to help

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,039
understanding this is how you build your

190
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,240
defenses

191
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,440
and how you're going to build your

192
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,599
instant response as well

193
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
because if you're not collecting logs

194
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,319
from the right sources if you're not

195
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,000
doing the right kind of analysis one

196
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you're going to miss the attack but then

197
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,680
two doing incident response is going to

198
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,319
be that much harder so you need to

199
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
understand the different points of a

200
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,440
ransomware attack and be able to

201
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,680
um and be able to move

202
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:04,879
be able to

203
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,960
locate them data even if it's after the

204
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,520
attack be able to locate indicators that

205
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,599
they were there

206
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,599
so we're going to start with

207
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:15,120
uh you know we're going to divide this

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,440
up into five phases you have the initial

209
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,039
access reconnaissance and lateral

210
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:21,680
movement exfiltration deployment and

211
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,319
then extortion

212
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,000
the first one is the initial access and

213
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,720
the really four main ways that we look

214
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,958
at initial access in a modern ransomware

215
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,880
attack the first that everybody's

216
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,599
familiar with is the phishing attack

217
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:41,599
um you know that is not as common as it

218
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,839
used to be still fairly common still a

219
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,839
whole lot of fishing attacks or at least

220
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,920
the fishing attempts going on

221
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,519
um but it's actually fallen by the

222
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
wayside compared to some of these other

223
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
methods um part of it is that fishing

224
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,240
has gotten more expensive so renting

225
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,560
fishing infrastructure is is more

226
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,160
expensive for a lot of these ransomware

227
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,760
actors and especially the ones just

228
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,279
getting started they simply just don't

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,320
have the money to do that and so uh you

230
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
know sort of we see fishing with some of

231
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,800
the

232
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
the big players you know conti still

233
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,360
relies heavily on fishing um and we see

234
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
that a little bit with lock bit and some

235
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,680
of the others um but mostly other

236
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,200
ransomware actors are looking at some of

237
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,800
these other methods

238
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,640
uh credential reducing credential

239
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,440
stuffing attacks especially with rdp and

240
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,720
citrix are really popular um

241
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,720
and it's a low cost of entry right if

242
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,600
i'm an initial access broker and and

243
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,080
step back for a second for a definition

244
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,560
um initial access broker so a lot of the

245
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,320
ransomware groups they don't actually

246
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,959
gain that initial access themselves

247
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,120
um instead what they do is uh they buy

248
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,880
it from other groups to go around and do

249
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,120
it so initial access brokers are one of

250
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,880
those cottage industries that have kind

251
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
of stepped up

252
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
you know to support the ransomware

253
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,640
industry uh we see a lot of these i you

254
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
know you'll see this with money

255
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,399
launderers are much more popular now

256
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,399
because there's so much money to launder

257
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,000
things like that so all these different

258
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
other groups and so what initial access

259
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,600
broker does is they go around and they

260
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,440
get the initial access

261
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,880
and present that to uh for sale to the

262
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,880
um to the ransomware group some of them

263
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
do it on the underground forums directly

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,519
others do it on uh others actually work

265
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,959
for one of the ransomware groups so

266
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,040
essentially they contract their work out

267
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
and are paid per uh target that they get

268
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
so credential stuffing credential reuse

269
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,200
is a really easy attack you basically

270
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,839
scan the internet for open ports and

271
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,839
then try common username password

272
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
combinations or if you can figure out

273
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,160
if you find an open system and you can

274
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
figure out what organization it belongs

275
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,240
to hunt on the dark web for

276
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,000
credentials for that organization and

277
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,720
try and uh try and uh reuse those

278
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,399
credentials we saw that with the

279
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,200
colonial pipeline attack last year um

280
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,519
where they were able to get gain access

281
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,800
to a

282
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,200
vpn system that should have been shut

283
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,880
down but unfortunately wasn't um and so

284
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,480
uh they were able to gain access to that

285
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,839
connected to uh credential reuse and

286
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,519
credential stuffing attacks or

287
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,000
third-party attacks so

288
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
uh again this we saw this with um

289
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,000
uh we saw this with

290
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,200
uh the cassaya attack um where the

291
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,720
ransomware actor will gain access to a

292
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:33,279
mana service provider or some other

293
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
uh vendor that's connected into multiple

294
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,240
systems

295
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:40,320
and rather than ransomware that vendor

296
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,560
or that managed service provider they'll

297
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,360
use their access to gain access to their

298
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,680
customers and then launch the ransomware

299
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,120
attack there increasingly common um

300
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
again it often relies on that credential

301
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,440
reuse model but the credential we use

302
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,279
instead of coming from the outside is

303
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,680
coming from a trusted source real hard

304
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,000
to defend against um unless you have

305
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,040
proper

306
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,240
you know uh

307
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,959
identity and access management in place

308
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,800
but but a real problem

309
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,839
uh then exploitation is the last one we

310
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,760
see and you know right now we're

311
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,639
tracking about 40 to 50 different

312
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,399
exploits that are used by ransomware

313
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,880
actors very rarely a zero day but we are

314
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,959
seeing that increasingly so we saw that

315
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
recently with the qnap um

316
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,279
uh ransomware attacks that were going on

317
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:29,600
where they they discovered a zero day in

318
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,440
uh the qnap

319
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,399
platform uh and were able to exploit

320
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,839
that in order to uh encrypt files on

321
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:40,959
those backup systems

322
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,399
once they get in

323
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,399
for the initial access they have their

324
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
entry point they're going to put in a

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,240
web shell or loader of some sort run

326
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,720
some local commands do a quick scan

327
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,399
and then they're going to turn around

328
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,040
and sell that to the actual ransomware

329
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,639
actor so this part's generally carried

330
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,959
out by initial access broker not always

331
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,279
but generally and then they flip that

332
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,440
over for you know a few thousand to

333
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
maybe ten thousand dollars depending on

334
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,480
the

335
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,560
organization where it's located its size

336
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,160
etc put that over to the um

337
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,240
to the actual ransomware actor

338
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:14,959
so

339
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,120
uh you know really there are two methods

340
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
once the ransomware actor gets in they

341
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,600
generally stick to either cobalt strike

342
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,959
or ps exec those are kind of right now

343
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:27,760
the two that are really really popular

344
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,240
may change over time but you know for

345
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,320
right now that's what we're looking at

346
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,560
um and then there are a bunch of

347
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,399
commands that are that they generally we

348
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,240
see them using whether it's every called

349
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,560
metasploit lasagna um power splits um

350
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,120
mimi cats bloodhound add fine

351
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,399
that's what they're using to basically

352
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,240
scan the network understand how the

353
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
network's set up get the credentials

354
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,040
they need to move around the network a

355
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,160
lot of living off the land also happens

356
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,199
where they're looking for you know

357
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:02,000
command.exe they're using or they're

358
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
using command.exe ping powershell task

359
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,240
manager um who am i when rm you know all

360
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,079
of these sort of native commands that

361
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,760
are there and they're looking to gain

362
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,160
access to endpoints linux server esxi

363
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,480
servers windows servers and most

364
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,160
definitely the domain controller the

365
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,079
main controller sort of the heart of all

366
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:22,720
of these ransomware attacks so really

367
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,279
you know if you had to devote resources

368
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,399
to two things um in trying to stop a

369
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,079
ransomware attack after the initial

370
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,959
access looking for cobalt strike

371
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,199
and looking for attempts to gain access

372
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
to the main controller from uh you know

373
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,279
through credentials or from locations

374
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,279
that shouldn't be there

375
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,240
um

376
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,360
and so

377
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,800
while they're trying to gain access

378
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
they're also looking getting the

379
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,320
accesses they need and learn about the

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
network they're also uh looking for

381
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,839
files they can steal so they'll run out

382
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
and they'll scan

383
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,279
all the different uh files

384
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
are all the different servers

385
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,040
you know look for things named file

386
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,160
server etc they'll pull the file listing

387
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,480
down to a single machine

388
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,199
and then they will find all of the files

389
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,040
they think are interesting

390
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
and they will exfiltrate those files

391
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,160
they are not subtle about it either they

392
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
will

393
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,519
you know put them all up in uh using our

394
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:22,800
clone or

395
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,040
7zip and they will just push them all

396
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,199
out usually late on a saturday night or

397
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,279
sunday morning

398
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,360
they're also big fans of mega sync

399
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,000
that's been very very popular so

400
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,639
uh you know i advise all organizations

401
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:37,839
at this point unless you have a

402
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,079
legitimate reason use it just to block

403
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,240
mega.nz or any of the uh other alias

404
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
domains that it uses um

405
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,959
there aren't a whole lot of legitimate

406
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,120
organizations that that use at least not

407
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,920
large organizations so just blocking

408
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,680
access to that can be helpful that's not

409
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,839
necessarily going to stop exfiltration

410
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,519
but it will at least generate an alert

411
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
that hey somebody trying to send a whole

412
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,279
bunch of data up to here maybe we should

413
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,600
investigate that

414
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,839
and then they're going to deploy the

415
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:09,279
ransomware surprisingly

416
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,160
we will often see one or two systems hit

417
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,560
first to test it

418
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
and then they will deploy the ransomware

419
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,800
either using a batch file something

420
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,720
through the domain controller

421
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:23,759
usps exec or smb to push it out they'll

422
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,920
delete shadow copies they try and delete

423
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,000
the backups and then they um some of

424
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,839
them even try and uh

425
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,560
cover their their tracks by removing or

426
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
rolling over log files so it's harder to

427
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,120
track them down um

428
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
and then uh

429
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,160
after that

430
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,240
you have the extortion that can be days

431
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,399
to weeks and with extortion you're

432
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,240
looking at that you know the obvious

433
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,040
they publish the stolen files um but we

434
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,480
do have that expen extend excuse me

435
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:55,759
expanded extortion ecosystem so things

436
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,839
like we see them trying to call clients

437
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,160
now um we see them trying to uh

438
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,120
uh

439
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,319
you know we see them trying to call

440
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,720
vendors um we see them report to stock

441
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,359
exchanges anything they can do to really

442
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,400
say hey

443
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,599
um look we we we've we've captured this

444
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,679
person's data we're going to publish it

445
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,119
if you don't um you know if you don't

446
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,880
encourage them to pay the ransom so if

447
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,400
they can't get you to pay the ransom

448
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
directly then they're going to do

449
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,319
everything they can to get uh your

450
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,280
clients or your partners or your vendors

451
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,600
to force you to pay the ransom so you

452
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,039
know they really want to go out of their

453
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,160
way to embarrass you

454
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,440
so wait

455
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
i already have an ir plan why do i need

456
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,559
one specifically for ransomware

457
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,080
first of all if you already have an ir

458
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,880
plan fantastic you are way way ahead of

459
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:52,000
many many organizations that i already

460
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,280
that i talk to and

461
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,280
that i've worked with in the past so i'm

462
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,080
glad that you have an ir plan hopefully

463
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,400
it's updated and you have a printed out

464
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,600
copy of it

465
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,039
somewhere that is also regularly updated

466
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:10,880
so

467
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,520
your normal ir plan

468
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,360
accounts for

469
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,360
one or two machines going down oh you

470
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
know we had a power outage in the data

471
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,280
center two servers didn't come back up

472
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,240
what's our instant response plan or oh

473
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,320
hey we found this thing in the network

474
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:30,720
what do we need to do in order to fix it

475
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,280
with ransomware

476
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:34,720
there's a good chance everything is

477
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,480
going to be unavailable you're going to

478
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,240
have all of your servers down you're

479
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,320
going to have many of your workstations

480
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,160
down

481
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,400
you may have your cloud environment

482
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,160
infected many ransomware actors are

483
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,400
really focusing right now on

484
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:51,600
linux and esxi as targets

485
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,440
so you may lose all of your virtual

486
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,559
machines

487
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,400
um

488
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,280
and so your normal ir plan

489
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
only accounts for a limited outage not

490
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,559
your entire network being out

491
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,080
having an outage

492
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,000
so this is why

493
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,679
often

494
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,600
as part of your incident response plan

495
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,360
you need to have a supplemental for

496
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,000
ransomware what am i going to do

497
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
if i'm hit with a ransomware attack and

498
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,120
how do i handle that specifically

499
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,120
because that may be different you know

500
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,480
that's one thing

501
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,400
if it's something the security team can

502
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,280
handle but generally a ransomware

503
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,679
response plan requires all hands on deck

504
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,440
you're going to bring in your security

505
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,160
team your it team you know your uh if

506
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
you have your own incident response team

507
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,240
obviously they'll be involved you may

508
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,919
need to bring in the help desk and you

509
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
you'll probably need to bring in outside

510
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:46,559
parties as well

511
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,440
all right

512
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,600
so

513
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,880
if you have an instant response plan

514
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
you know that

515
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,720
your incident response plan

516
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,960
has to start well before an incident

517
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,640
happened and that's really phase one

518
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,880
that prepare

519
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,440
so you need to think about a couple of

520
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,679
things

521
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
what data will you need to conduct an

522
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,840
effective incident response

523
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,080
so especially in the ransomware attack

524
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,440
you're going to want to know how the

525
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,039
ransomware actor got in how they moved

526
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,440
around what kind of things you missed

527
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,440
and so what kind of logs do you need you

528
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,280
know things like that that often people

529
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,480
don't think about

530
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,200
uh are you collecting powershell logs

531
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,159
are you collecting logs from memory um

532
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,960
you know are you collecting all endpoint

533
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,600
logs all of these things are really

534
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,880
important

535
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,400
and you want to make sure that you have

536
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,600
that data

537
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:42,000
um you know are you going to look at dns

538
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,240
logs are you going to look at firewall

539
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,960
logs what all logs are involved so think

540
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,080
about how a ransomware attack worked

541
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
um from the you know a couple slides

542
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,679
back and make sure that you're

543
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,320
collecting log points from all of those

544
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,000
little things like a lot of times

545
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,520
ransomware actors the first thing

546
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
they'll do is they'll shut down your

547
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,640
security tool so they'll get in there

548
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,000
and they'll see that oh okay you're

549
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,919
running uh carbon black let's go ahead

550
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,000
and kill that that should have generated

551
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,320
an alert in your sim maybe that's not

552
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,799
something that you react to immediately

553
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,640
but you want to make sure that that log

554
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,799
is in there so it's something that you

555
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:20,960
can pull up later and figure out how to

556
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,240
trace that

557
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,679
um and then what personnel they're going

558
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,159
to need to be involved right ransomware

559
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,159
attack again as i said it's all hands on

560
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,159
deck so it's not just having

561
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,559
your it and your security teams involved

562
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,320
you'll likely need to bring in help desk

563
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:37,760
you may need to bring in third party

564
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:39,440
you're going to need to bring in your pr

565
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,520
team you may need to bring in human

566
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,679
resources leadership is certainly going

567
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,799
to want to be involved because you're

568
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,159
going to know when things are getting

569
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,480
back up and running and most importantly

570
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,600
you're going to need to have your legal

571
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,200
team involved

572
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,360
if you are an organization of any size

573
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,559
and you get hit with the ransomware

574
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,240
attack at least in the u.s you are

575
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,080
likely going to get sued so you want to

576
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,440
make sure that you're running everything

577
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,120
you do through your legal department and

578
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,720
we'll talk about this later but you all

579
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
you also may need to run everything

580
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
through outside legal counsel um if you

581
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,919
have cyber insurance you're going to

582
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,520
want to get your cyber insurance company

583
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,760
on the phone right away if you have an

584
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,600
instant response retainer and i highly

585
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,280
recommend having an incident response

586
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,120
retainer because you will get

587
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
overwhelmed

588
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:20,400
um you're going to want to get them on

589
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
the phone too if you're working with a

590
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,679
managed service

591
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,799
an mssp a manager that managed service

592
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,640
security provider

593
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,159
you're going to want to bring them in as

594
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,320
well so you really want to think about

595
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,159
all of this in advance because you want

596
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,559
to have a contact tree and start calling

597
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:39,120
in and you do not want that contract

598
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,880
you do not want that contact tray i

599
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,760
swear i can talk um to be

600
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,159
on one of the machines that's encrypted

601
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,080
so you need to have all of this in in

602
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,520
advance and you need to have all this

603
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,919
planned um so now is the time to make

604
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,559
sure you're collecting the data and

605
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,640
have and know what they will be doing

606
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,240
and make sure everybody is aware of what

607
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,480
their role is going to be in the event

608
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,000
of a ransomware attack nobody should be

609
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,840
taken by surprise oh wait i have to come

610
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,000
in and help with this everyone needs to

611
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,679
know that in advance that this is what

612
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:10,320
we're going to do

613
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
um

614
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,480
and again

615
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,640
you know i can't stress this enough

616
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,440
your out of band comms plan should not

617
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,240
be

618
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,159
in the middle of an investigation saying

619
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,400
oh let's switch to signal right

620
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
um

621
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
uh some ransomware groups are very

622
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,240
sophisticated some are stupid some kind

623
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,159
of suck but the ones that are really

624
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,919
good are really good

625
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,720
um and these groups will target your you

626
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,440
know your your uh email they will target

627
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
your internal ticketing systems and they

628
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:42,320
will even target slack or whatever so

629
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,320
you want they will be looking to see if

630
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:47,200
you're on to them before the before they

631
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,679
actually deploy the ransomware

632
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:51,200
so if you start to think that you're in

633
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,279
the middle of a ransomware attack you

634
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,559
want to switch to your out-of-band

635
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,000
comspin and you want to have that

636
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,159
figured out beforehand whatever that is

637
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,000
whether it's setting up a group chat on

638
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,159
signal whether it's a discord whether

639
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,000
it's something else that's outside of

640
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,240
your normal realm but that is

641
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:07,919
pre-approved

642
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,000
you want to make sure that

643
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,840
you've activated that you know what that

644
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,080
it what that is um really really

645
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,520
important

646
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
and you want to make sure that you you

647
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
know understand what's going to happen

648
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
there you know uh

649
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,320
especially early on in in advanced

650
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
branson response there's a lot of

651
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,400
confusion there's a lot of

652
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,159
kind of not understanding of what's

653
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,240
happening you want to make sure that you

654
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,919
have a clear comms plan and that you

655
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,279
have all the people that need to be

656
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,400
involved involved

657
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,840
the next step is to identify

658
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
you've got to figure out

659
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,840
uh who's hit you obviously it's pretty

660
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
easy to identify that you've been hit

661
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,640
with a ransomware attack i don't think

662
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
anybody ever has a problem figuring out

663
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,720
that oh yeah this is a ransomware attack

664
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,799
there are a couple of exceptions

665
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,080
um

666
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:58,880
uh

667
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
you know some rants some wiper

668
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
attacks like to disguise themselves as

669
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,200
ransomware but they're not they're just

670
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,440
wiper and they're designed to destroy

671
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:10,000
your organization not uh

672
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,640
not not try and get money from them um

673
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,000
but for the most part you know when

674
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,840
you've been hit with a ransomware attack

675
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,919
however it is sometimes surprisingly

676
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,679
difficult to know which ransomware group

677
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,159
hit you uh some ransomware groups

678
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,720
especially like evil corp they like to

679
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
disguise who they actually are because

680
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
evil corp is sanctioned by the u.s

681
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,360
treasury and so if you pay evil corp a

682
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,679
ransom you may be getting fined you may

683
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:36,159
you'll get at least be getting a visit

684
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,360
from ofac

685
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,400
um

686
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
and so

687
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,960
you want to make sure that uh you know

688
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,279
who is actually behind the ransomware

689
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,559
taxes services like id ransomware um are

690
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:50,159
really good at you know upload the

691
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,520
ransom note and they tell you what

692
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,840
ransom uh uh they tell you what ransom

693
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:56,240
you've been hit with um so you know a

694
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,440
big part of what you're going to have to

695
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,840
do during the initial

696
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,600
initial incident responses figure out

697
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,158
who hit you

698
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,240
and that's when we need to talk about

699
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:07,279
lawyers

700
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:09,520
so you've been hit by ransomware

701
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:11,120
you're going to have to get your legal

702
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:14,320
counsel involved but you also will have

703
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,200
to notify your cyber insurance company

704
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
who may want you to use outside legal

705
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:21,360
counsel there are a whole lot of reasons

706
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,679
for that and i'm not a lawyer so i'm not

707
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:26,159
going to try and explain them to you

708
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,840
but you should understand this and you

709
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,360
should talk to your cyber insurance

710
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,279
company ahead of time if they're going

711
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,480
to want you to have a third legal

712
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,039
counsel because likely if you have an

713
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,200
outside legal counsel they will likely

714
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
want to have your uh

715
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
outside incident response and everything

716
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,760
report through them

717
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,559
and that is to protect your company

718
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,320
from future lawsuits again i'm not a

719
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,760
lawyer so i'm not giving you legal

720
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,440
advice

721
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,360
but you need to know what this means in

722
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,919
advance so again part of your

723
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,000
preparedness for your instant response

724
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,400
really needs to be reaching out to your

725
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,159
cyber insurance company and say what

726
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,000
happens when i get with the get hit with

727
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,159
a ransomware attack what are the next

728
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:09,039
steps um from your perspective just so

729
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,720
you understand and you want to have your

730
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,480
legal counsel on there and so

731
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,919
everybody's in agreement everybody

732
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,400
understands that plan again this is not

733
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
something you want to be doing while

734
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,360
you're in the middle of trying to

735
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,440
contain and clean up a ransomware attack

736
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
you want to already know what this plan

737
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,360
is ahead of time it goes a long way to

738
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,600
keeping you safe keeping you protected

739
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,640
and making the incident response as as

740
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,039
smooth as it can be makes it that much

741
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,640
more smooth

742
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,039
um the next step is to contain you want

743
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,399
to make sure

744
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,080
that your

745
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,880
uh

746
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
the ransomware attack does as little

747
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,240
damage to your network as possible once

748
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,240
you've identified it you've got to get

749
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,600
moving and you've got to get moving

750
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,799
quickly

751
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,640
ideally your network is segmented

752
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,000
we've seen this over and over again

753
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,440
flight networks

754
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,039
everything gets encrypted very quickly

755
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,880
not a whole lot you can do about it you

756
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,960
have a segmented network you often have

757
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,039
the opportunity to disconnect networks

758
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,600
and make sure that they are protected

759
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,520
and they never get hit but even in the

760
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,679
flight network depending on how much

761
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,080
deploy deployed you may be able to

762
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,679
contain the ransomware attack once you

763
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,760
realize it's happening maybe as simple

764
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,000
as you know telling everybody to shut

765
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,640
off the wi-fi um now that may not be

766
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,279
enough but you know um you may be able

767
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,080
to shut down switches you may be able to

768
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,679
if you absolutely need to power down

769
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,440
computers i don't recommend that um but

770
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,919
uh but but if you have to you have to

771
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,080
the important thing is to save as many

772
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,520
machines as possible from getting

773
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:40,080
encrypted so your containment strategy

774
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,480
whatever that is plan for that in

775
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,919
advance because you want to send one

776
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
notification out to everybody and you

777
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
want to send it out as quickly as

778
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,760
possible everybody do this whether it's

779
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,480
disable the wi-fi whether it is shut

780
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,559
your computer down um whether it's your

781
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,880
it team going and shutting switches down

782
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,960
in the in the in the closet whatever

783
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,240
that's going to be or shutting down the

784
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
wi-fi routers whatever your containment

785
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,320
strategy is you want to have that

786
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:05,760
planned in advance and you want to

787
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,600
implement that as quickly as possible

788
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,840
let's try and save as many machines as

789
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,919
we can um you know keeping in mind that

790
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,080
you want to prioritize

791
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,000
your backups and your servers if they

792
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,799
haven't been hit yet because that is

793
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,080
what the ransomware actors are going to

794
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,440
be going after so hopefully your

795
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,600
organization is following the 321 backup

796
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,320
rule that is three copies of all your of

797
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,919
all the data that's being backed up on

798
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,000
at least two different formats one of

799
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
which is not connected to the network

800
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
ideally off-site although not connected

801
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,480
to the network is is is the important

802
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,279
part

803
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,840
um so they want your backups and they

804
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,600
want your service they want your esxi

805
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,080
server so if you've got a you've got a a

806
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
data center that that you maintain or if

807
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,159
you've got them in the cloud or wherever

808
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:52,159
they are you want to figure out how to

809
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,159
save those first and that's probably

810
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:55,840
what you're going to prioritize for

811
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,760
containment i know that sucks i know

812
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
rebuilding workstations

813
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,080
is awful

814
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:04,000
but there's generally not a whole lot of

815
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,279
sensitive data you have to worry about

816
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,399
on the workstations um uh you know so

817
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,840
you can take your time getting those

818
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,840
rebuilds or buy all new ones

819
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,159
you know having your servers locked up

820
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,320
is much much much more difficult to deal

821
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,799
with so you know again i highly

822
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:22,399
recommend prioritizing uh containing

823
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:25,039
uh your backups and your servers as

824
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:26,640
quickly as possible knowing that that's

825
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,159
where the ransomware actors are going to

826
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,399
be focusing their efforts so if you've

827
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:32,159
detected the rents if you've detected

828
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,480
the ransomware early enough being able

829
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,480
to stop them from getting to those is

830
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:38,000
going to make your recovery that much

831
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,120
easier

832
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,159
um

833
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:41,840
and then you also want to figure out

834
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,279
very quickly

835
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:45,520
what the um

836
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:47,760
what the initial point of entry is

837
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,440
and the reason for that is you've got to

838
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,799
get that shut down you've got to get

839
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:53,360
that shut down early on in the

840
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,600
incident response process i know that

841
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,720
seems kind of intuitive and

842
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,120
counter-intuitive right you you've got a

843
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,480
whole lot of things that you need to

844
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,440
clean up but 80 of ransomware victims

845
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,200
suffer repeat attacks

846
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,679
um and often within a couple of months

847
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,600
and that's because during the recovery

848
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,200
process they don't close down whatever

849
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,679
that however the ransomware actor got in

850
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
so plugging that initial point of entry

851
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,880
is going to be really important to

852
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,399
prevent reinfection now i'm not saying

853
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,760
you have to do it

854
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,840
during the containment process i'm just

855
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,480
saying you have to identify it early on

856
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
so that part of your part of the next

857
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,559
phase can be let's get that fixed and

858
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:30,399
let's get that fixed quickly because you

859
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
want to make sure that you are

860
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,600
protecting it so you want to get it

861
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,960
while you start the logs while you still

862
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,039
have all the data there trying to figure

863
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,480
that out and you have to remember that

864
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,159
there are a lot of initial access

865
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,679
brokers right now

866
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,559
that are working to gain access to all

867
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:50,159
of these different systems and so if one

868
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,320
ransomware group found

869
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:54,880
this whatever this weak point is

870
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,480
likely there's another

871
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,159
ransomware group that will find it as

872
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,720
well and so you really want to make sure

873
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,120
that you're keeping yourself uh

874
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,960
safe and you're keeping those ransomware

875
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,799
actors out as you're working your

876
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,360
recovery

877
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,440
um

878
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,840
so

879
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,000
every ransomware

880
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,159
recovery effort that i've been involved

881
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:20,960
in

882
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:22,880
has involved a whole lot of people a lot

883
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,480
of people within the company giving up

884
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,919
their time

885
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,440
a lot of people from outside of the

886
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,799
company

887
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,799
working a lot of long hours

888
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,760
um

889
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,200
so you want to make sure you've got a

890
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,120
plan in place to feed them you don't

891
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,960
just want to be providing pizza every

892
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,760
night um

893
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,279
i mean maybe you do maybe everybody

894
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,240
loves your pizza and you have the

895
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,760
greatest pizza place whatever but but

896
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,360
you need to have a plan in place for how

897
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,120
you're going to feed everybody

898
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,960
um i know it probably seems weird that

899
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
the big guy is telling you to make sure

900
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,880
you got food um but

901
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:56,480
honestly you need to feed the people

902
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,880
they need um they're going to be working

903
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,480
long hours

904
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,240
everybody's going to be tired originally

905
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:03,840
cranky make sure you're keeping

906
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,080
everybody well fed at least

907
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,799
think about if you have people coming in

908
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
you know not necessarily your outside

909
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,480
incident response but if you have

910
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:13,519
internal people they're going to be

911
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:14,880
working these long hours think about

912
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,399
getting a block of hotel rooms or

913
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,799
something that they can go crash at um

914
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,720
especially for those that live you know

915
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:22,240
an hour or so away they're going to be

916
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,679
working long hours et cetera and they

917
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:24,960
may not want it they may want to go home

918
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:28,159
to their families um but

919
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:30,960
at least give them that option

920
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,880
especially during the first couple weeks

921
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:36,559
when the work is the most intense

922
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:38,720
and then after that initial containment

923
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,840
and the initial containment is going to

924
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,480
be a lot of really long hours

925
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:44,720
you want to keep people working on

926
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:46,640
during using regular shifts during the

927
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:49,039
rebuilds and the disaster recovery

928
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:50,840
process

929
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:53,600
um but you also want to make sure you're

930
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,679
now giving them time off you don't want

931
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,320
to artificially have them working long

932
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,600
hours if not needed um so once you get

933
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,679
into a regular routine hopefully you can

934
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,840
go back to normal shifts and you know

935
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:07,200
people come in know what they're doing

936
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,599
and so on they may be longer than normal

937
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:11,440
but they shouldn't be kind of the insane

938
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:13,199
hours that the initial containment is

939
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,199
probably going to involve

940
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,879
you really really

941
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:20,239
want to look out for your people um i've

942
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,760
seen it time and time again where

943
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,440
organizations get hit with ransomware

944
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,359
attacks and

945
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:27,520
uh results in a whole lot of burnout of

946
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,359
staff um and then staff leaving

947
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:32,960
after the

948
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:36,079
um after the initial attack or you know

949
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,679
after the containment and recovery

950
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,760
because they're just so exhausted

951
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,399
they want to go somewhere else um so if

952
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:44,079
you can prevent that burnout i think

953
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,440
it's really good again think of the

954
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,280
mental health of

955
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,040
of your people

956
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,719
now we get to the fun face now we get to

957
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,520
kick them out um

958
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,679
so it's not just the ransomware itself

959
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,839
that you have to worry about but it's

960
00:34:57,839 --> 00:34:59,760
all of the persistence tools that the

961
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,280
ransomware actors use so you know we

962
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,200
talked about cobalt strike we talked

963
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,680
about whatever implants they have um you

964
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:06,560
know

965
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,160
all of the different tools that they

966
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,079
have that they've used to maintain their

967
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,359
access

968
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,359
are still sitting in a lot of these

969
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:14,800
systems

970
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,640
even if those systems were never

971
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,160
encrypted

972
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,359
so you want to start looking for

973
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,839
uh logs for indication of tools that

974
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:27,200
might have been missed right

975
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,680
you want to look for unusual powershell

976
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,240
scripts unexpected logins c2

977
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,079
communications anything executing in

978
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:36,079
memory all of those weird things that

979
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:38,640
are signs of ransomware groups so

980
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,680
um you really want to

981
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,640
uh

982
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,680
you really want to find every indication

983
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,320
of what the ransomware actor

984
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,320
was doing in your network and remember

985
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
sometimes they can be

986
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,920
in that network for weeks or months um

987
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
months is less often than it used to be

988
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,599
but it still is possible that they're in

989
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:00,880
there for months

990
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,880
so

991
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,920
you really want to go and make sure you

992
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
fully understand their

993
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,839
pattern of attack

994
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:11,680
so that when you're doing the restoring

995
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,760
from backup you don't accidentally

996
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760
restore some of their persistent message

997
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,480
methods and give them uh you know give

998
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,320
them new access

999
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,599
um

1000
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:22,720
so

1001
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:25,359
you um so you want to

1002
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,280
you want to be able to

1003
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:29,280
really look through all of those

1004
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,720
different servers

1005
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,560
find those indicators um and remember as

1006
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,320
you're um

1007
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,280
uh

1008
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,640
you know as you're going through that

1009
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,839
you're really going to want to

1010
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,720
understand how they attack work build

1011
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
out a big picture of that attack you

1012
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,640
know whiteboard if necessary everything

1013
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,800
that you know that they used so you can

1014
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,119
look for those you know sort of forensic

1015
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,000
indicators on the the servers that

1016
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
didn't get encrypted but also as you're

1017
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,240
restoring from backup

1018
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,240
communicate communication is so

1019
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,839
important you want to have a plan in

1020
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,359
place to communicate internally and

1021
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:05,760
externally you want to keep employees up

1022
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:08,480
to date and especially those that talk

1023
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,640
to vendors and customers to know what

1024
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,560
can be said and what not can be said i i

1025
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,119
was recently involved in a ransomware

1026
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,040
attack um

1027
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,480
where

1028
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,560
it was actually contained so the the the

1029
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,760
the company

1030
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,560
found the uh ransomware actor

1031
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,400
um as they were trying to make a leap

1032
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
from one part of the network to another

1033
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,560
part of the network isolated them

1034
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,960
shut them down but they had to

1035
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:37,280
shut down a part of the network

1036
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:39,119
to make sure that there were no other

1037
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,000
indicators of that ransomware after well

1038
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,079
one of their vendors called the help

1039
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,599
desk

1040
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,760
and said hey we can't get access to this

1041
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,240
network anymore what's going on and the

1042
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,520
person helped us said oh we had a

1043
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,119
ransomware attack

1044
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,800
well the vendors shut off their access

1045
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:56,880
and this is increasingly common right we

1046
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,119
talked about how third-party ransomware

1047
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,560
attacks are

1048
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,560
a growing problem

1049
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,560
um well it works the other way as well

1050
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,079
your vendors don't want to get hit by a

1051
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,720
ransomware attack with by you

1052
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,480
and as soon as the help desk person said

1053
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:12,880
oh we were hit with a ransomware attack

1054
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,680
not giving them the full story

1055
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,760
the vendor shut off their access until

1056
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,079
they could verify that they weren't

1057
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,760
under threat anymore that there wasn't

1058
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,040
going they weren't going to be hit with

1059
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,000
a ransomware attack so again

1060
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,119
you really want to make sure you

1061
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
communicate to anybody that's talking to

1062
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:32,000
vendors saying hey um yeah we had a

1063
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,920
security incident and then redirect

1064
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:35,839
communication to whoever is leading your

1065
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:37,359
incident response so that they can

1066
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:40,160
handle it properly you want to make sure

1067
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,760
that hey you want to keep your vendor

1068
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,920
safe and protected but also you don't

1069
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,760
want to get shut down unnecessarily

1070
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,400
especially if you have things contained

1071
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,160
you also want to keep the pr team in the

1072
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,800
loop uh i mentioned this earlier when

1073
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,640
you're talking about the out of band

1074
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,960
comms pr should definitely be a part of

1075
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,119
that because it's likely somebody will

1076
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,640
notice that you're having a ransomware

1077
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,280
attack and will uh

1078
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,520
you'll start getting questions um and

1079
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,680
you may start getting them earlier than

1080
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,440
than expected i've seen this happen

1081
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,400
before

1082
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,240
you know you'll start seeing complaints

1083
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,200
on facebook or twitter um about you know

1084
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
oh i can't reach so and so something's

1085
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,320
going on

1086
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,640
some kind of cyber attack local reporter

1087
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,400
picks that up gives you a call hey

1088
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,079
what's going on it sounds like you have

1089
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:25,760
a ransomware attack according to twitter

1090
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:29,040
and you're like wait what um and so you

1091
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:30,800
want your pr team to be prepared know

1092
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,200
what to say what not to say etc you want

1093
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:35,839
to have that thought out in advance so

1094
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:37,359
that you really know

1095
00:39:37,359 --> 00:39:40,160
um uh you know what to say and you have

1096
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,480
very tight communication

1097
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,520
yeah i'm always a fan of

1098
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:47,920
to a point more communication is better

1099
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,160
you don't necessarily want to hide the

1100
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,240
fact that you've had a ransomware attack

1101
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,000
um but you don't want to over share

1102
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,040
either so you know again that is

1103
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:59,680
between you your lawyer your leadership

1104
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,240
team and your your you know uh public

1105
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:05,520
relations team however you wanna spin

1106
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,440
that you wanna have that conversation um

1107
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,119
early in advance

1108
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:13,200
with your with your team and you want to

1109
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,560
make sure you're keeping everybody

1110
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,400
internally and updated externally

1111
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,960
updated and if you're you know in turn

1112
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
any internal communication make sure

1113
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,640
that everyone understands that has to

1114
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,119
remain private that is not to leave the

1115
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,520
organization

1116
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,440
all right so now we've got to stop the

1117
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,560
next attack or as we call it recovery

1118
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,599
um

1119
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,760
so

1120
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:37,359
you know

1121
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:39,359
you've once you've contained the

1122
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,160
ransomware attack you can start the the

1123
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,319
restoration process

1124
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:45,839
um

1125
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:46,800
and

1126
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,200
you're gonna do this

1127
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,079
segment by segment right you're gonna in

1128
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:54,640
isolation you're gonna bring up

1129
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,599
um

1130
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,520
you're gonna bring up a part of the

1131
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,599
network um

1132
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:00,800
and

1133
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,000
make sure

1134
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:04,240
after everything's been restored that

1135
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,640
there's no indicators of

1136
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,760
the uh of the ransomware actor sitting

1137
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,319
in the network um you're going to make

1138
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,880
sure that there's no you know aaron

1139
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,400
calls out the plan of control so you're

1140
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,520
going to bring those that up in

1141
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,160
isolation and then you're going to pop

1142
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,640
them back on the network and then

1143
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
monitor that network segment very

1144
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,920
closely to make sure in case there's

1145
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,839
anything you missed then you're going to

1146
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:29,680
do the same thing you're going to go and

1147
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,200
you're going to bring up the next

1148
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,960
network segment

1149
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:33,920
you're going to make sure that

1150
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,800
everything's up and running now ideally

1151
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:37,920
um

1152
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,599
you know this is a great time to get rid

1153
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:40,880
of some of those old machines that

1154
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,040
you've had and replace them with all

1155
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,040
brand new machines and restore to those

1156
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,440
brand new machines just so that you're

1157
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:50,640
not just wiping and and uh

1158
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,720
and restoring but actually putting out

1159
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,000
new hardware

1160
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:56,640
um that's not always possible but it is

1161
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,319
something to think about

1162
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:00,079
anyway you're still whatever whether

1163
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:01,040
you're going with new machines or

1164
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,040
restoring to old machines

1165
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:04,400
you're still going to follow that same

1166
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,400
process isolate

1167
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,000
restore

1168
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,480
from backup or rebuild

1169
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,160
if it's not not something that was

1170
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,680
backed up if it's a workstation or

1171
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,839
whatever

1172
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:18,560
rebuild connect it to an isolated part

1173
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,040
of the network monitor for any c2

1174
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,440
activity or anything unusual and then

1175
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,680
once you've confirmed that there's no uh

1176
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,160
no lingering activity then reconnect it

1177
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,000
to your network this takes a long time

1178
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,760
this takes you know i mean fortunately

1179
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,920
you'll have teams working on it but it

1180
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,160
still takes a while to get it all done

1181
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,079
and you want to make sure but you want

1182
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:39,280
to make sure you're careful the last

1183
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:40,560
thing you want to do is reinfect

1184
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,720
yourself really really important in this

1185
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,400
phase to make sure that you're not doing

1186
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,240
anything that is going to

1187
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,040
potentially cause problems or cause you

1188
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,640
to uh

1189
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,920
reinfect the network

1190
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,440
and as you're going through this

1191
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
recovery process now's the time that you

1192
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,079
want to stop the next next attack

1193
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,800
so after everything is up and running

1194
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:06,319
you really want to go over and

1195
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:08,880
understand how the attacker got through

1196
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
how despite whatever investment you've

1197
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:11,680
made

1198
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,599
the attacker got through is there

1199
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,920
something needed i i'm not a fan of

1200
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:17,599
adding more

1201
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,400
to your security stack or your it stack

1202
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,400
we already have too much right i mean

1203
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,960
for almost any organization they've got

1204
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,480
way too many security things they've got

1205
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,160
way too many i.t things um uh you know

1206
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,839
and i know all the vendors watching now

1207
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,599
are going no no no that's not true but

1208
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:37,200
it is um you have too much stuff um

1209
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,760
so i'm not saying that you want to add

1210
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,440
in anything

1211
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,839
you want to understand how you could

1212
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,440
have configured

1213
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,760
what you have differently

1214
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,359
so that

1215
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,280
so that it's you you would have better

1216
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,359
protected yourself is it a different

1217
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:55,680
level of alerting is it a different type

1218
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,839
of log setting were there features that

1219
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,920
you didn't have enabled for one reason

1220
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:02,560
or another in the platform that you have

1221
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,720
that um maybe

1222
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,200
needed to be enabled and that would have

1223
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,839
detected it um it could be that

1224
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:11,280
everything is fine with the type of

1225
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:12,720
equipment that you have the type of

1226
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,240
software you have the type of solution

1227
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,240
you have but you didn't have the right

1228
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,400
alerting procedures on the back end you

1229
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,920
know it may be that you have to have

1230
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:21,520
different priorities given to different

1231
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,520
types of alerts maybe if you're working

1232
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,319
with an mssp maybe they didn't get the

1233
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:27,760
right alerts or they weren't getting the

1234
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,839
right logs so you want to make sure they

1235
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,359
get to them

1236
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,119
so you really want to go through that

1237
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:34,640
process it's not a blame session we're

1238
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,400
not trying to figure out whose fault it

1239
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,319
was that there was a ransomware attack

1240
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:39,599
this is the ransomware actor's fault

1241
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,599
that there was a ransomware attack never

1242
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,000
forget that you know yeah it sucks that

1243
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,280
you missed everything but they're the

1244
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
bastards that broke into your network

1245
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,960
and encrypted everything and ruined your

1246
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,599
life for a month or more um so never

1247
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:54,240
forget that it's now is not the time

1248
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,599
for

1249
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,520
fighting with other departments within

1250
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,640
your organization or or whatever now's

1251
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,800
the time to figure out what went wrong

1252
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,079
and make sure that you uh

1253
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,920
um you know make sure that it doesn't

1254
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,240
happen again going forward um and yeah

1255
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,079
it may be that you figure out that oh

1256
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,000
hey you know these systems that we have

1257
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,520
that we thought would do what we needed

1258
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:18,000
to do don't do then you want to replace

1259
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,160
inadequate equipment but don't make the

1260
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:21,680
assumption that the right answer is

1261
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,839
always the new shiny thing because it's

1262
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,520
not always the right answer the right

1263
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,359
answer is better workflow making sure

1264
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:28,800
that you have the right personnel in

1265
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:30,720
place making sure that you're collecting

1266
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,800
the right data sets and you have the

1267
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,520
right alert level set up for those

1268
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,119
organizations

1269
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:38,160
um

1270
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,920
so then you want to present a plan to

1271
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,319
leadership that will help improve your

1272
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,160
security monitoring and hopefully

1273
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,400
present the prevent the next attack

1274
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,839
there's going to be money that has to be

1275
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,680
spent i mean part of that hopefully will

1276
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:53,118
come from your cyber insurance

1277
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:57,839
but there is going to need to be changes

1278
00:45:57,839 --> 00:45:59,040
to your budget you're going to have to

1279
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,880
spend money

1280
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,800
in order to make improvements that's

1281
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,720
just the reality of it

1282
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,160
you got hit with the ransomware tax

1283
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:08,079
something wasn't working right so

1284
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:09,599
whatever it's going to take to make it

1285
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:12,000
work right that's what you

1286
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,960
want to look at unless we're going to

1287
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,280
phase six where we're going to review

1288
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,319
um

1289
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,760
you want to whatever those changes are

1290
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:24,720
you really really want to test them

1291
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,480
you want to run through and i'm a big

1292
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,480
fan of tabletop exercises i think

1293
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,440
well-run tabletop exercises are so

1294
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,800
important because they help

1295
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,359
organizations

1296
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,079
really understand where the deficiencies

1297
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,440
are

1298
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,720
and often especially if you have um uh

1299
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,960
if you have an incident response company

1300
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,880
if you've given them a retainer you can

1301
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:49,520
sometimes use some of that retainer

1302
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,079
money to have them come in and conduct a

1303
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,560
tabletop exercise so as you implement

1304
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,640
these new changes running through and

1305
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,960
running tabletop exercises again real

1306
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,520
tabletop exercises

1307
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:04,400
to verify that the changes actually work

1308
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,640
that they're actually effective can be

1309
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,720
really good you know it actually tests

1310
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:10,480
your assumptions to test your workflow

1311
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,839
and make sure that everything is going

1312
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:13,599
to work as it is

1313
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,040
um

1314
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,160
if you found that there was a lot of

1315
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,760
communication breakdown during your

1316
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,359
instant response make those

1317
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:21,680
communication changes and again test

1318
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,319
those out as well do a you know a

1319
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:26,640
saturday morning let's do a call tree

1320
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,400
whatever it is that that you need to do

1321
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,319
in order to test those communication

1322
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:32,400
changes you really want to test those as

1323
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,720
well to make sure that

1324
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,400
um

1325
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:37,760
to make sure that you're kind of

1326
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:40,480
following through and that you have them

1327
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,440
um and everything needs to be documented

1328
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,440
uh you know this is sort of

1329
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,079
the the the big thing with all incident

1330
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:49,680
response plans that i think everyone

1331
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:51,839
needs to understand is that an instant

1332
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:54,559
response plan is supposed to be a living

1333
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:55,599
document

1334
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:57,839
when you make a change you need to

1335
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
update that document not just a soft

1336
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,280
copy but whatever hard copy you have

1337
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,760
stored in a folder somewhere you know

1338
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,160
there should never be a layer of dust on

1339
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,400
that folder because it should always be

1340
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,240
being pulled down and updated with new

1341
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,920
information

1342
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:15,599
you really want to document everything

1343
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:17,760
so that you fully understand what

1344
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,599
happens if you go and you move on to

1345
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,440
bigger and better things anybody can

1346
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,119
kind of step in your place and follow

1347
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:25,680
that incident response plan and and not

1348
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,000
have a problem so documentation is

1349
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:29,280
really really important if you don't

1350
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,240
have an ir plan documented now again as

1351
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,839
we talked about in the beginning now is

1352
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:35,599
the time to plan before the ransomware

1353
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:37,599
attack start building that instant

1354
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:39,920
response document if nothing else even

1355
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:41,680
if it's not perfect you at least start

1356
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,760
getting things down on paper and start

1357
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:45,040
thinking about how you're going to

1358
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:47,200
handle a ransomware attack when it

1359
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,760
happens

1360
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:51,920
um and then set realistic goals for

1361
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,359
implementing those changes and then

1362
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,119
follow to make sure those changes are

1363
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,359
made i i know you know like after the

1364
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,760
you know after the ransomware attack and

1365
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,200
after the recovery is done everybody's

1366
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,400
really going oh great we're going to get

1367
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:04,960
all this done but then real life catches

1368
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,720
up you still have your day of job you

1369
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,960
still have the minor incidents happening

1370
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:10,480
you still have the i.t things that need

1371
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,680
to be done you still have the other

1372
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,760
projects that need to be implemented so

1373
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:16,720
really set realistic goals but follow up

1374
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,400
to make sure the changes are actually

1375
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:20,000
made don't say we're gonna have all this

1376
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,160
done in six months if realistically it's

1377
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:24,400
gonna take a year to do it it sucks that

1378
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:26,319
it's gonna take a year to do it but take

1379
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:28,160
that actual year make sure it's done

1380
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,599
right make sure it's implemented right

1381
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
make sure it's well documented but make

1382
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,760
sure it is finished and again conduct

1383
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,839
those tabletop exercises to make sure

1384
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:37,920
the regular changes are made and then

1385
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,040
hopefully

1386
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:40,880
y'all didn't kill each other during the

1387
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,240
the actual ransomware attack um and you

1388
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,680
actually kind of

1389
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,920
did you know engaged in more cooperative

1390
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,680
activity really

1391
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,520
learned to work with each other and

1392
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,640
build on that build on that cooperation

1393
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,160
that was made during the incident and

1394
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,400
honestly i see that happen most of the

1395
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,640
time where organizations that typically

1396
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,119
didn't like each other very much now

1397
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,680
suddenly are very close and

1398
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,920
um working together and you know kind of

1399
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:10,640
have a newfound trust uh for working

1400
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,280
with each other build on that and make

1401
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:14,880
sure that you are

1402
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,960
um you know make sure you you're making

1403
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,200
these changes to improve the overall

1404
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,520
organization security ransomware is the

1405
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,640
thing right now that's the thing

1406
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:24,480
everybody's worried about but there are

1407
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,319
other kinds of security problems that

1408
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,559
are always going on and you can use this

1409
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,960
kind of newfound cooperation to build

1410
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,599
out a better security program overall

1411
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:35,520

1412
