1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,880
do it live

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:07,520
all right

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,960
and we

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,639
are live

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,320
okay we got started a little bit late

6
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,559
and so this is going to be just like one

7
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,199
minute with george ortiz hi george how

8
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:19,439
are you i'm doing great wow you

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,439
pronounce my name so well

10
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,640
thank you

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,519
i rehearsed it in advance uh we are

12
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
since we got you started late we're just

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,039
going to ask the most important question

14
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,960
what are the benefits of purple teaming

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,880
over standard red teaming or blue

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,360
teaming individually that's a great

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,160
question so purple teaming is a function

18
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,079
right doesn't mean you stop red teaming

19
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,399
and you stop blue teaming to do this

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,399
just like you don't stop vulnerability

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,680
assessment because you're doing

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,000
penetration testing um

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
benefit it really comes down to value uh

24
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,440
most times you do a red team engagement

25
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
takes a while from the engagement

26
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,640
actually happening to the report to the

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,199
reveal to working together

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,320
and try to fix things um purple teaming

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,680
should happen between those times um and

30
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,360
really it's the value of educating the

31
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,760
blue team in what you are doing what the

32
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
red team is doing and the blue team

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,119
educating the red team as to what uh the

34
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,040
the blue team's doing you know everyone

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,000
learns right it's all about

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,880
collaboration working together uh you

37
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,080
know being a herd being a community the

38
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,400
malicious actors are working together we

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,400
should probably work together too uh

40
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,280
it's just

41
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
a more efficient way of uh of improving

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:33,920
that sounds great so we're not

43
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,759
abandoning red or blue we're just adding

44
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:37,720
some purple in there for the spectrum

45
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,560
exactly awesome well if you have any

46
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
more questions for george feel free to
