00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,920
we're going to go into what is active

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,400
defense the phases of an act of defense

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,279
mission

14
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,760
mission selection and planning

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,840
pardoning and re-testing and finally

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,680
reporting in lessons learned and then

20
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,840
we'll end it with a question and answer

57
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,000
i've been

58
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,038
doing

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,800
offensive and defensive security for

60
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
almost a decade now

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,000
working as a consultant for most of that

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,400
time across multiple industries

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
including

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,440
banking finance

65
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,359
telecommunications and retail

66
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,319
so let's talk about the threats all

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,400
around us

68
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,560
you pick up a newspaper every day what

69
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,920
you're probably going to see is some

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,879
form of breaking news cyber attack

71
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,480
whether it's log for j or a multitude of

72
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,879
different actors nation states organized

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,280
crime groups uh

74
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,040
there's really an endless supply of

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,680
these stories coming out

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,360
in the next slides

77
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,040
uh some of those stories that i

78
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
mentioned

79
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,840
this is all most of these are from 2021

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,319
so you have hafnium which is blamed on

81
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,319
chinese state government

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,720
they attacked microsoft exchange servers

83
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,959
throughout the world

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,720
accenture

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,959
the global consultancy

86
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,120
accounting firm as well was attacked by

87
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:20,800
lock bit game

88
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,879
there was they downplayed it but there

89
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
seems to be reporting that came out

90
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:25,920
around

91
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,680
some of their customers and their data

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,400
being affected

93
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
gigabit was hit by the ransom exxx

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,480
ransomware

95
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,840
a new apt was targeting hotels uh and

96
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,159
hackers reached the colonial pipeline

97
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,159
being here in the u.s i i know we all

98
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,799
felt the gas prices increase i i drove a

99
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,640
pickup truck i know that was not a fun

100
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,400
one for me

101
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799
but as i said multitude of attacks

102
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:52,640
across different industries

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
and different types of advanced actor

104
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,799
groups but what can you do about it the

105
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,519
next scientist

106
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,439
uh well you need to start monitoring for

107
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,159
instance the bears spiders and kittens

108
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,640
uh those are the fun names come up

109
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,799
coming up with by crowdstrike for

110
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
different advanced persistent threat

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,080
groups

112
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,959
next slide please

113
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,478
so again how do you defend against these

114
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,320
attackers how do you

115
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,560
how do you stop advanced attacks before

116
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,000
they even occur

117
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,840
well robin and my solution is active

118
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,440
defense we'll go through what that is so

119
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,600
active defense it's an intelligence-led

120
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,320
cross-team exercise that evaluates an

121
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,160
organization's readiness for a cyber

122
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,800
attack so we leverage the our

123
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,320
understanding from an intelligence

124
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,680
perspective of

125
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
what tools techniques and procedures

126
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
exist in the while during

127
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
realistic cyber attacks so when all of

128
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:49,919
those

129
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,759
bears kittens and spiders go after an

130
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
organization in real life so the new

131
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,280
stories that we showed a second ago

132
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,960
what is what techniques are being used

133
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,560
in those attacks

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,320
we as an intel team go through we

135
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,560
enumerate them we grab them and then we

136
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,000
work with the team like robbins and

137
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,320
purple which is the purple team and we

138
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:08,400
test our security controls and we harden

139
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,960
our security controls off the results of

140
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,520
what robin and his team do

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
we try to cause the most pain to an

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,440
adversary as possible and that's why

143
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
going after the pyramid of pain there we

144
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,120
go after the things that are the most

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
difficult for them to change

146
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
so the ttps the tools

147
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,280
we try to stay away from artifacts ip

148
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
addresses and hashes just because they

149
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,520
can be more easily changed

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,320
so

151
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,160
what does an active defense mission

152
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,160
specifically test

153
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,080
our ability to identify and disrupt and

154
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,160
attack so we look at the tools

155
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,320
techniques and procedures of the cyber

156
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,520
adversary

157
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,039
we then look at the efficacy of the

158
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,199
tools so how well is our endpoint

159
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,600
detection response tool responding to

160
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,840
host-based attacks how well is our email

161
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,080
hygiene solution stopping phishing

162
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,199
messages

163
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
and we we enumerate through the attack

164
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,479
chain of the actor we want to emulate

165
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,560
we do pre and post mission state so we

166
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,560
understand where we were and where we

167
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,639
are after the mission and we harden our

168
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,319
controls during that time period in

169
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:09,280
between

170
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,639
and then we gauge the willingness and

171
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,400
ability of the organization's security

172
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,280
teams to cooperate and innovate against

173
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,159
these techniques

174
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,639
anything else you'd like to add robin

175
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,319
no

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,440
awesome let's go to the next slide then

177
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
so the phases of active defense i've

178
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
alluded to them talked about some of the

179
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,360
terminology in there but let's go to the

180
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,280
faces themselves

181
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,720
so looking at the chain here

182
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,800
i recommend if you have the manpower

183
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,560
forward for it to be a continuous

184
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
process

185
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,560
in organizations i've worked for and

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
collaborating with robin in the past

187
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
we've shot to do it once a quarter but

188
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,639
again depending on the size of your

189
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,639
security teams what resources you have

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,560
available and the other things going on

191
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,759
it can

192
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,520
it can change but doing it on a

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
quarterly basis ensures that you have

194
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,479
four advanced tests a year which really

195
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,080
do help to build up your security

196
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,560
controls but phase one is the mission

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,160
selection and planning that can take

198
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,080
three to four weeks what you want to do

199
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,400
during that phase is really work as a

200
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,840
team to understand what threats are

201
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,560
relevant to you and then design a test

202
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,960
around which teams you want involved

203
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,199
things all of those lines

204
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,560
then you go into the threat hunting and

205
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,560
establishing a baseline why do you do

206
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,479
this you want to understand that the

207
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,639
actor adversary malware the the topic

208
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,960
you've chosen for the mission isn't

209
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
currently impacting your organization

210
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
you want to have the zeros across the

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
board none of the hashes or indicators

212
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,800
that you're looking for associated with

213
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,800
threat are existing in your environment

214
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,880
you do this to ensure that you do not

215
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,199
pollute the test and the results you get

216
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
back are actually your team test so you

217
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,960
can have a

218
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,039
isolated sample of the way in which your

219
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,720
controls work

220
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,240
then you go to the control testing that

221
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,840
should take about two to three weeks

222
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,840
depending on the scope of the assessment

223
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,120
obviously you test more techniques the

224
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,879
security control validation testing can

225
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,560
increase there are tools that will help

226
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,160
you automate this

227
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,319
but in reality shoot for two to three

228
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,639
weeks one to two for threat hunting and

229
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,720
three to four permission planning

230
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,560
so after you've done your initial tests

231
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,560
you want to then work with your security

232
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
teams the experts over those spaces and

233
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,400
that's about three to four weeks to

234
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,759
build out new hardened controls

235
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
then you need to do your retesting which

236
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,199
that should take about one to two weeks

237
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:28,479
if you have the infrastructure already

238
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,639
built out from the initial validation

239
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,719
testing and then reporting is two to

240
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,839
three weeks

241
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,519
i highly recommend building templates

242
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,679
there's ways to make this quicker but in

243
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,039
reality you want to build some buffer

244
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,799
time

245
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,880
and that's the phases of active defense

246
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,240
and what it looks like from a timeline

247
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
perspective here the next live police

248
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
robin

249
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,440
so we're going to talk a little bit

250
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,279
about this first stage the mission

251
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,839
selection and planning

252
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,160
so

253
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,680
what do you look at to make a good

254
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,360
mission topic

255
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
you should see whether it's adversary

256
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
based or campaign-based and you would

257
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,640
look at your security controls and

258
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,800
understand your environment as an

259
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,360
in-house team i can tell you that i know

260
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,440
very well who is on the radar who are

261
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:14,399
the the topics uh if you conducted your

262
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,240
a yearly assessment of the threat

263
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,760
landscape or

264
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,120
you keep

265
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,320
pretty good track of the news you'll

266
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,080
know who is in your space who's going

267
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,320
after your sector

268
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,760
you want to ask yourself a couple

269
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,080
questions you want to ask is it relevant

270
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
to your organization is it relevant to

271
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,560
your suppliers to your peers do you have

272
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,880
enough data to build the threat model

273
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
do you have enough data to test against

274
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,800
your security controls

275
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
you're looking at this and you're trying

276
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,040
to massage out a scenario that is

277
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,959
relevant to

278
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,560
a specific adversary you're interested

279
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,880
in a campaign a piece of malware

280
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,920
something of interest to the

281
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,320
organization something interested to

282
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,920
your suppliers and something interesting

283
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,680
for your peers that's how you know you

284
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,959
have something

285
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
of a topic that's focused and enough and

286
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
relevant enough to your organization and

287
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,079
your

288
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,399
your company your security team

289
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
you're the next slide please robin

290
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,279
again you want to look at what's going

291
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,720
on in the news do you want to test

292
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
hapmium if you're i do a lot of business

293
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:14,720
via email uh

294
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,640
do you worry about ransomware

295
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,399
is that a big topic for you

296
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,320
are you in the hospitality sector and

297
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
you're worried about this new apt

298
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,079
targeting hotels are you in energy and

299
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,320
working worrying about um

300
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,760
being hacked since what colonial

301
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,079
pipeline was or again another ransomware

302
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,000
topic what is important to your

303
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,519
organization what's important to your

304
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
board what's important to your leaders i

305
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,680
can tell you as an intel team that's

306
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,000
super important for us and we work every

307
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,079
day to make sure we have that

308
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,000
understanding so when questions arise

309
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
like what is our susceptibility to an

310
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,320
attack by a group like hacking

311
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,920
or what is our susceptibility of a

312
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,640
ransomware attack we can put together

313
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,079
tests and missions like an act of

314
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,440
defense for these topics

315
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
next slide please

316
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,720
all right so we're going to go a little

317
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,800
bit about what threat modeling is and

318
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,279
what we mean by threat model

319
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,200
so when we build a threat model we want

320
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,640
to develop a complex

321
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:12,480
multi-staged use case based off of

322
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,480
threats targeting our critical assets

323
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
there's a lot there to unpack but the

324
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,880
multi-stage and complex piece is what i

325
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
want to call your attention to

326
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,640
we want to look at things like building

327
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,279
a threat profile so it just involves

328
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,320
spoofing tampering reputation impact

329
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
information disclosure denial of service

330
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
encryption if it's um if it's a

331
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,720
ransomware game elevation of privilege

332
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
lateral movement

333
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,959
what goes into that threat profile well

334
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,320
you model the threat what does the

335
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,720
business concept look like what type of

336
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,079
architecture do you want to test what's

337
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
security controls uh where does the data

338
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,959
flow come from where do where does your

339
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,519
most secure data and crown jewels reside

340
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,240
is this threat context something that

341
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,160
you as an intel team who is a purple

342
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,839
team know about

343
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,360
you want to do a risk assessment what

344
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:02,000
what is cyber risks to you is it threat

345
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
times vulnerability times impact is it

346
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,760
uh does do you define threat of

347
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,760
capability times likelihood how do you

348
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,639
go about defining all of this once you

349
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,519
have this input and you understand the

350
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:14,880
way the threat behaves and you're

351
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,200
building out these multi-stage complex

352
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,440
scenarios you want to move in to make

353
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
sure that your detection logic is

354
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,160
developed in a way that you can identify

355
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,639
suspicious activities similar to the

356
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,320
threat profile you've built out you want

357
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,760
to be able to identify the events the

358
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,839
malicious behavior this is something

359
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
that you should be able to detect when

360
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,040
you test

361
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,240
so the way we work is that we identify a

362
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,399
specific group we build up the threat

363
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,079
profile around them the way that they

364
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,320
would behave going after specific

365
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
technologies and what do we have that

366
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,279
would stop them from accessing our data

367
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,839
and we can we align those techniques to

368
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,279
the miter attack

369
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:54,800
framework let me go to the next slide

370
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,040
please

371
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,839
as i said miter attack so we use miter

372
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,320
attack as an industry standard to help

373
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,519
build out that profile of the threat

374
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:08,880
we prioritize via a threat model so

375
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,639
critical threat high threat moderate the

376
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,959
informational threat we prioritize the

377
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,079
techniques based off of who's using them

378
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,920
it's a common lexicon that we can share

379
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,920
across disciplinary teams

380
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
robin's team from an offensive and

381
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,519
defensive standpoint is much different

382
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,320
than my team which would be intel

383
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,079
but we use the same language because we

384
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,680
both stick to mitre

385
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,519
we can reflect new campaigns or attack

386
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,200
methodologies

387
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,440
the the framework is constantly evolving

388
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
there's new adversaries new techniques

389
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,959
constantly uploaded i believe we're on

390
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,040
version 10 now

391
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
they do a really good job including

392
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,440
relevant data like during the half vm

393
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,959
attack which we have they updated the

394
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,959
tools and technologies there same with

395
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,120
solarwinds a lot of those tools started

396
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
showing up in the matrix so that teams

397
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,959
can go through and

398
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:57,680
build build out the models they want

399
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,360
in the same line

400
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,279
they have training courses out which are

401
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,079
free which can help teams understand and

402
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,639
build their own mappings but everything

403
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,959
in mitre is tied back to real attacks

404
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,639
observed in the wild i want to highlight

405
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,160
that and that's one of the most

406
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,839
important parts for our testing and the

407
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,320
reason we use this model and framework

408
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,639
is because this is all real things that

409
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,320
have happened

410
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
it also maps back to securing privacy

411
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:26,160
controls vietnamese sp 853 this linkage

412
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,639
offers potential suggestions that we can

413
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:30,880
provide to more of the strategic

414
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,880
architecture teams which helps to bridge

415
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
that gap as well

416
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
anything you'd like to add on

417
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,560
uh

418
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,800
nope

419
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,680
rock on all right coming in next slide

420
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,600
all right so we we want to talk today

421
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,839
about the venomous bear this was a group

422
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,399
we chose at random but when we look at

423
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,560
this group they're very interesting uh

424
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,160
we wanted to show what crafting the

425
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
narrative and emission scope looks like

426
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,079
so the way we would do this is we would

427
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,360
talk a little bit about the group so

428
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,279
turlo or venom despair is a

429
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,519
sophisticated russian-based adversary

430
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,680
attributed to the fsb or russian federal

431
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:07,120
security service

432
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,880
uh turla has

433
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
infected victims in 45 countries

434
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,040
spending range of industries including

435
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,279
government embassies military education

436
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,279
research and pharmaceutical companies

437
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,120
i'm going to stop there for a second as

438
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,199
you can see on the screen it's bolded

439
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,040
that 45

440
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,040
countries and then the range of

441
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,959
industries affected

442
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:28,720
we have a good narrative and a good

443
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,680
scope

444
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,920
we recommend including

445
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,639
where the attacker has gone so terla has

446
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:37,199
attacked or a wide range of countries in

447
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,360
the west we talk about where they're

448
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,720
attributed to if you have that

449
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
information and then we talk about the

450
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,959
industries so we help focus in so this

451
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,320
would be a scenario that would fall into

452
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
one of the industries listed below so if

453
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
it's government if it has to do with the

454
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,880
military if it's the educational sector

455
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,480
if it's research it's pharmaceutical

456
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,440
companies

457
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,279
right there we help gauge the interest

458
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,560
and why it's important to the

459
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,240
organization

460
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,320
then we take it a little bit

461
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,160
historical so what has turla done how

462
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,079
long have they been active ultrella has

463
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:08,880
been active since 2004. perla is known

464
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,240
for conducting watering hole and

465
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
spearfishing campaigns leveraging

466
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,880
in-house tools and malware so that talks

467
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
a bit about how they behave

468
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
and then we say turla's espionage

469
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,120
platform is mainly used against windows

470
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,440
machines but has also been seen used

471
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,320
against mac os and linux machines

472
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,639
that helps set the scope so we know that

473
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:31,199
we want to test the effectiveness of a

474
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:34,240
terla similar or emulated attack that

475
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
uses watering hole and spear phishing

476
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
campaigns and in-house tools and malware

477
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:42,399
specifically targeted to windows devices

478
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,199
mac devices and linux devices and that's

479
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,800
how we focus on what we're going to test

480
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,880
and then you take it to the what we're

481
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,079
going to do so because terla adopts new

482
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,000
and complex techniques to maintain

483
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,240
operational security they have prominent

484
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,399
command and control networks that

485
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,399
heavily focus on those operational

486
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,720
security concerns we're going to build

487
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,559
an active defense mission around the

488
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
tools techniques and procedures observed

489
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:11,439
in the wild turtle intrusions

490
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,880
so we've done a lot there with this

491
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,520
crafting emission scope but by doing

492
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,599
this in the way that we've shown we set

493
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,480
up for a very complex multi-staged

494
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,839
mission

495
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,199
just as we said we would do in the

496
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,240
threat model

497
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,599
robin can you hear the next slide please

498
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,120
so

499
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,440
again very heavy on the miter attack

500
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,080
side of this this ensures that we have

501
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,960
very specific techniques to test against

502
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,880
so we use this example running with

503
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,000
turla

504
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,240
we want to look at turles axis token

505
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,960
manipulation so create process and token

506
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,440
turtle uses rpc backdoors that can

507
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,280
impersonate or steal tokens before

508
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,200
executing commands

509
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,640
we also want to look at things on the

510
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
way which terla

511
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,880
discovers group policies so that's t

512
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,000
1615 turtle surveys a system upon

513
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,760
check-in to discover group policy

514
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,520
details using the gp result command

515
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,520
so as you can see there's quite a few

516
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,559
different techniques it's kind of like a

517
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
burger menu so you choose what toppings

518
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,160
you want but you can also choose which

519
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,440
techniques you want to test for the

520
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
mission you may not want to test all of

521
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,480
these you want to make focus

522
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,720
specifically on those windows linux or

523
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,960
mac based techniques

524
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,640
it's really about what you want to do

525
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,720
from that perspective

526
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
we got these techniques and the

527
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,760
explanations around them from the mitre

528
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,400
attack website we recommend using that

529
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,160
as a resource but there's also security

530
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,400
researchers who put out miter attack map

531
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,559
data quite a few vendors like crowd

532
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,559
strike fire eye

533
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,080
a lot of them have adopted the mitre

534
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,280
attack framework as well and are

535
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,840
publishing reports that map activity

536
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,520
back to the mitre attack framework so

537
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,960
when you build out your mission you

538
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,720
should have a lot of data to rely on in

539
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,760
use

540
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,120
robin anything you'd like down on this

541
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,280
one

542
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,360
no i think it's uh i think it's

543
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
important to have uh

544
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,120
a fair bit amount of coverage across uh

545
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,280
you know different uh tactics and

546
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,039
techniques within the the moderate

547
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:09,600
attack life cycle so it's it's always a

548
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
good idea to have as much as possible

549
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,960
across the entire attack life cycle this

550
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,960
way when you're testing

551
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,160
um

552
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,039
you can kind of add a definitive

553
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,280
reference point onto where you're having

554
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,919
control successes or control failures

555
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:30,240
through this uh attacker's life cycle

556
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
that's a really good point that helps

557
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
you frame out

558
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,280
when your security team would be

559
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,679
successful and unsuccessful in detecting

560
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,000
an attack how how far is too far in the

561
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,120
environment

562
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,960
great point robin um could you go to the

563
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,360
next slide please sir

564
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,200
all right so now we're to planning your

565
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,400
mission

566
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,080
so we've listed a whole bunch of key

567
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,280
stakeholders but again we want a complex

568
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:55,280
multi-stage mission so the more

569
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,120
stakeholders you involve

570
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,840
the more in depth your mission will be

571
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,000
some common teams are cti

572
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,840
which is cyber intelligence blue team

573
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,679
which is your defensive team

574
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,440
endpoint detection response teams

575
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,919
network security network operations

576
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,480
firewall cloud dlp

577
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:15,120
dfir vulnerability management and purple

578
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,280
team so we've hit a lot of different

579
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
teams there and again

580
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,720
you need to basis by your own

581
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,240
organization if you're thinking about

582
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,480
running the national defense mission if

583
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,000
you have the capabilities and

584
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,919
relationships across all those teams and

585
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,360
more great

586
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,679
bring them in my recommendation is to

587
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,200
make sure that you explicitly say the

588
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,600
responsibilities and actions expected of

589
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,039
each team

590
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,880
and i'll ensure you won't get anyone too

591
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,120
confused nobody will step outside their

592
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,080
bounds

593
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,799
everything will be very neatly done

594
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,679
in this initial phase of of the active

595
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
defense mission to deliverables should

596
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,799
be active defense mission plan a kickoff

597
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,679
meeting

598
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,520
having your leadership team sign off on

599
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,440
the mission and metrics around the time

600
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,880
to plan the mission so you should know

601
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,159
how long it took you to build the

602
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:04,159
mission get everybody bought in and

603
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,480
agree on the next steps

604
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,840
you go to the next slide please robin

605
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
so we're now at threat hunting and

606
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,679
establishing the baseline

607
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,840
next time

608
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,679
all right yeah so uh just a quick uh

609
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,480
overview here of uh threat hunting and

610
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
starting to establish a baseline in your

611
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,919
environment

612
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,600
so the threat hunting phase of an active

613
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,640
defense mission involves uh collecting

614
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,799
uh indicators of compromise uh

615
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,760
specifically associated with the uh with

616
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,559
the adversary or or campaign

617
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,159
that was described back in the mission

618
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:43,440
plan

619
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,280
so the reason we do this

620
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,400
um

621
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,080
this ioc based uh hunting

622
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,840
um

623
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,520
is to to

624
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,760
check our environment

625
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,679
before purple team conducts uh security

626
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,520
control validation

627
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
so you're gathering up these indicators

628
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,960
of compromise

629
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
you're you're going through each of your

630
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,879
security controls whether it be edr

631
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
edr

632
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,520
web app controls

633
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,640
um

634
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,880
you know anti-virus

635
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,240
looking through those with these

636
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,320
specific iocs

637
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,000
and then determining if you're actually

638
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,960
going to be starting your testing in a

639
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,440
clean environment based upon what is

640
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,440
already known about this adversary

641
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,799
once once these uh

642
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,520
once this ioc based threat hunt

643
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,880
baseline

644
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,720
is established

645
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,159
from there you can move to the next

646
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,480
phase of actually

647
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
beginning to test these security

648
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,760
controls

649
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,679
so some primary teams that are typically

650
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,960
involved

651
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,280
during this threat hunting phase of an

652
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,039
active defense mission

653
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,520
the blue team sock analyst

654
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,559
endpoint detection response

655
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:07,679
maybe network security teams

656
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,360
so they could take a look at firewalls

657
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
uh web gateway team so they could take a

658
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
look at the web gateway on traffic you

659
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,039
know based upon the iocs have been

660
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:16,240
collected

661
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,200
and

662
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
a critical piece uh cyber threat

663
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,360
intelligence who

664
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,360
provides uh

665
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,440
these indicators of compromise

666
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,840
and feeds them to these other teams

667
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,360
so they can begin their hunt and

668
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,600
determining a clean environment prior to

669
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,200
the execution

670
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,679
of of the security control validation

671
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,159
testing

672
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:42,480
yep so uh collecting indicators for

673
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,039
threat hunting

674
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,360
cti teams

675
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:49,120
they will use open and closed source

676
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,440
intelligence

677
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,120
source areas

678
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,480
to look at

679
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,320
specific threats outlined in the active

680
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,679
defense mission

681
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:01,279
so here you can see we have some

682
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,320
indicators for the

683
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,320
tournament group

684
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,200
which which include you know minor

685
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:11,520
attack techniques

686
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,120
domains have been used in previous

687
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:15,840
campaigns hashes

688
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
targeted organizations any

689
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
vulnerabilities that they've been able

690
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,200
to successfully

691
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,640
exploit

692
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,720
upon intrusion

693
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,400
into an organization

694
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,080
or entity

695
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
and things like that

696
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,840
so this is just a quick look at that

697
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,799
so

698
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,159
uh establishing our baseline right so

699
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,720
um kind of the the outline steps in the

700
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,159
in the process of establishing your

701
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,159
baseline the blue team performs

702
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,080
intelligence based

703
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,760
hunting to identify host related iocs

704
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,000
related to turla's previously observed

705
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,440
tactics

706
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,360
the edr team

707
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,880
at the same time the blue team is going

708
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,520
through

709
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,320
their tools the edr teams are

710
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,679
using

711
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:07,279
your organization's endpoint protection

712
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,520
solution to perform

713
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,360
a deeper more granular intel based

714
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
hunt

715
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,960
looking specifically for any

716
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,960
command line activity

717
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
that could relate to

718
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:22,880
terla commander control persistence or

719
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,200
lateral movement techniques so

720
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,799
this is

721
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:31,120
this is kind of uh kind of before

722
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:34,640
it's kind of like a phase before um

723
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,039
before a more proactive type of threat

724
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,039
hunt so we're just looking at command

725
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,760
line activity that is known already has

726
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,600
this uh terla

727
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:44,799
adversary

728
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:47,679
um executed you know

729
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,400
run dll32 commands via the command

730
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,520
prompt um and it's very very very

731
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,360
specific

732
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,799
um

733
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,360
so uh in this phase as well the blue

734
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,880
team is is made aware of any sigma rules

735
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,159
uh which is a common nomenclature

736
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,039
that's

737
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:08,080
vendor

738
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,279
agnostic

739
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,520
uh base rules

740
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,120
that that allow organizations to then

741
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,080
convert those rules into tool specific

742
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,000
or vendor-specific rules that can be

743
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,400
used to further hunt for terla

744
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
uh minor attack ttps and logs um

745
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,000
on on host and the network and things

746
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,400
like that but sigma sigma's really great

747
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,400
because it it provides

748
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,799
a quick rapid way for us to develop

749
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,720
rules um and to get those out to the

750
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,159
blue teams so in this phase uh

751
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:42,720
typical deliverables include

752
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,720
adversary activity baseline if there is

753
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,840
any

754
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,240
so your baseline will either kind of

755
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,840
show nothing or it will show

756
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:53,919
problem an adversary has been detected

757
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:56,640
in your environment specifically terla

758
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,480
in this case right um and then you would

759
00:26:58,480 --> 00:26:59,760
have to

760
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:03,279
uh put off testing

761
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,840
and kind of handle that as a separate

762
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,360
incident before you did your security

763
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,919
control validation testing

764
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:10,799
um

765
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,240
metrics on iocs identified by the blue

766
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,400
blue team and edr teams

767
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,240
during the threat hunt and then metrics

768
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,679
on the time it took for the threat hunt

769
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,440
for the threat hunt

770
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,720
to uh from start to end i should say to

771
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,799
to get those iocs

772
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,600
and then um execute on

773
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,399
on essentially a discovery phase of the

774
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,439
intel base hunting

775
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,880
security control validation testing

776
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,760
so uh this is what i have i'm biased

777
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,039
because i'm on the purple team this is

778
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,159
what i view to be the bread and the

779
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,960
butter of active defense missions um so

780
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
establishing a baseline and threat

781
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,320
hunting is super important

782
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,159
and it's good to know that you're

783
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,760
you know you're you either have an issue

784
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,520
on your hands or incident on your hands

785
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,200
if you do discover something

786
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,440
based upon the active defense mission or

787
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,279
that you have a clean environment

788
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,120
but it doesn't in there right

789
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,720
so from a purple team perspective

790
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,640
security control validation testing is

791
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:13,360
where uh myself and my team come in

792
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:14,840
during an active defense

793
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,159
mission and we take a look at that

794
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:20,480
cti provided intelligence

795
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,159
we look at that minor attack threat

796
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,600
model

797
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,240
ttp specific to

798
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,559
to that adversary turler and

799
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,640
turla in our example

800
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,039
we'll take a look at the commands

801
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:35,520
that were executed on

802
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,240
on hosts during their you know

803
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,240
compromises of different organizations

804
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:42,799
what processes did they leverage

805
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,640
uh what type of command and control

806
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,720
infrastructure are they using

807
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,320
um is it cobalt strike type of uh you

808
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,399
know http https type of c2

809
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,279
infrastructure is it dns

810
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,640
and things like that so we'll take a

811
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,120
granular look a more detailed look at

812
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
that in intelligence

813
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,679
and and start to build out um

814
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,399
our own kind of pseudo turla adversary

815
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,679
replicating

816
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:10,080
turla

817
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,960
typically with an 80 20 approach where

818
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,600
80 percent is as close as possible to

819
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,159
the adversary such as turla um and then

820
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,320
we account for any variances that might

821
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,919
occur or

822
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:24,720
um any growth that that might

823
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,200
that adversary might have so adversaries

824
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
grow they mature they change gtps and

825
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,480
things like that we do want to account

826
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,600
for that uh so we kind of have a 20

827
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,600
variance on that

828
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,760
so uh why do we do this

829
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,840
uh security control validation testing

830
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,720
uh for these in in the wild uh

831
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,840
ttps is is performed to determine the

832
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,120
efficacy

833
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,240
of of the pre-mission state of an

834
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,480
organization security controls so how

835
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,960
does our web gateway hold up to

836
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,720
this malicious web traffic coming

837
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,200
through uh this is a very specific way

838
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,080
that turlo does it how does our

839
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,520
our edr

840
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,000
um detect or does it detect or does it

841
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,480
not how does it handle

842
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:12,240
what terla does when it compromises an

843
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,960
organization

844
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,440
and that gives us an insight into the

845
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,240
ability of our controls to detect alert

846
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,320
and block the techniques used by the

847
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,159
adversary

848
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:25,520
of interest

849
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:26,640
so

850
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,520
the who again you know a red team or

851
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,240
purple team ideally a purple team

852
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:35,200
um you know just because of the

853
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,120
expertise both offensively and

854
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:38,559
defensively

855
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,720
it's good to have those those mindsets

856
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:43,200
together on that one team to execute on

857
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,600
something like this but if you just have

858
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:48,559
the capabilities to execute offensively

859
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,799
kind of without that defensive mindset

860
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,799
on that team then a red team works just

861
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,200
fine as well and then again cyber threat

862
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,720
intelligence really critical to this

863
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,559
part of the process

864
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,159
as they provide

865
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:02,240
the minor attack threat model

866
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,360
any

867
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,840
any other type of intelligence pieces

868
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,879
that we would need to use

869
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,600
so continuing on uh

870
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,159
so just to dive deeper into the the

871
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,840
steps of the security control validation

872
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,399
process cti team will provide the red

873
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,720
team or purple team with a minor attack

874
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,640
threat model that details

875
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,480
all of the different techniques used

876
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,440
utilized by turla in our example

877
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:31,840
the purple team will then take those

878
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,120
build out their own adversary to execute

879
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:38,480
either automated in an ideal situation

880
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,000
you would want to automate you know as

881
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:42,399
much as possible using a breaching

882
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:45,039
breach and attack

883
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:46,799
simulation platform

884
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:49,840
um or if if a more manual test is

885
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,760
required uh

886
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,279
that's on the table too that's why we

887
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,120
have that offensive

888
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,360
uh that offensive security uh

889
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,200
perspective and experience on the purple

890
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,799
team

891
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,240
but this would just be a test of the

892
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,799
turla in in the wild techniques uh you

893
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,399
know checking each

894
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:07,919
each

895
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,880
can each ttp against each of our

896
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:15,120
uh organizational security controls

897
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,799
so then from there purple team will

898
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,480
produce a current state analysis of the

899
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,240
organization's security controls that

900
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,039
are within scope

901
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:25,360
of the active defense mission uh purple

902
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,679
team will take that analysis and brief

903
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:29,760
the the cti team with the security

904
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,840
control validation assessment results

905
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:34,080
and then provide any recommendations

906
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,960
you know if anything was uh

907
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,080
was noted as a gap uh let's say

908
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,600
uh you're testing

909
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,320
terla ttps on

910
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,679
on a host

911
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,120
um

912
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,240
that

913
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,919
you know is in an area of the network

914
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:52,640
that has some logging misconfigurations

915
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,880
uh so you're going through

916
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,919
your windows event logs in your sim

917
00:32:57,919 --> 00:32:59,360
and you find that your host is missing

918
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,120
all these windows event logs well that

919
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,440
that becomes a gap um and it becomes a

920
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,679
finding and and part of your

921
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,480
recommendation is to

922
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:11,600
ensure that there are no other missing

923
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,000
logs in the environment across all of

924
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,760
your your windows for example since

925
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,519
we're looking at windows events

926
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:18,720
um

927
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,039
and then kind of determine and recommend

928
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,880
a way forward from there right to

929
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,399
increase that

930
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:26,240
logging coverage or security control

931
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,519
coverage

932
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,240
um so some deliverables in this space uh

933
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,919
security control validation assessment

934
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:34,000
results security control improvement

935
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:35,919
recommendations

936
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:36,880
um

937
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,600
excuse me metrics on the efficacy of the

938
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,240
security controls what is being alerted

939
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,720
what is being blocked what is being

940
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,000
missed um more importantly right

941
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,240
and then metrics on time to test the

942
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,399
efficacy of the security controls kind

943
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,600
of start at an end date on how quickly

944
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,080
um you know you can test those those

945
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,159
ttps against your own

946
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,440
security controls right

947
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,399
up this is just an example

948
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:07,440
of

949
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,320
some

950
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
ttp specific uh security control

951
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
validation test results uh so you can

952
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,639
see we have the minor attack tactic we

953
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,918
do

954
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,839
a lot of everything based around

955
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,560
moderate attack uh the framework

956
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,520
it works for us we're able to connect

957
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,079
multiple pieces to minor attack so as

958
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:27,918
robert was talking about we're able to

959
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,440
convert

960
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,359
something like these test results that

961
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:34,239
you see on the screen here back to nist

962
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:38,159
to provide a a more organizational uh

963
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:41,040
view at security control failures

964
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,760
um in those specific areas

965
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,520
um so

966
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,599
what you're seeing here is it's kind of

967
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
like the first output right minor attack

968
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,918
tactic uh executes persistence

969
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,320
exfiltration ladder movement uh modern

970
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,399
attack technique where we're just

971
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
we're letting them know what specific

972
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,119
technique that we executed on

973
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,599
and mapping it back to miter and then a

974
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,599
pre-mission current kind of a current

975
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,200
state um endpoint detection rate so did

976
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,800
we miss everything with command and

977
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,640
scripting interpreter we would put zero

978
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:16,079
percent there did we get everything um

979
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,400
somewhere else like exploitation of

980
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,560
remote services we would mark it as 100

981
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:21,440
percent

982
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,359
all of our security security controls

983
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:24,560
were able to

984
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,160
either uh alert or block

985
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,320
that specific ttp so our objective

986
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:33,680
when we're testing

987
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,240
is to ensure that our security controls

988
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:38,960
are properly tuned running correctly not

989
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,599
missing any data but also

990
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:42,640
um

991
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,839
can it prevent what we're trying to

992
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,920
what we're trying to execute uh

993
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:52,000
as as an adversary or can it provide our

994
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,800
our sock analysts with a heads up and

995
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,960
alert so that they're able to respond

996
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,200
quickly

997
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:00,800
at the earliest part of the attack chain

998
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,359
as possible

999
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,880
security control harden the fun part

1000
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,520
so uh what is security control hardening

1001
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:12,720
so the

1002
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,079
the security control hardening phase of

1003
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
active defense mission

1004
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,920
uh involves uh

1005
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,760
security control technology owners to

1006
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,240
design and implement new detections and

1007
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,079
response logic

1008
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,839
um this could be a new firewall rule

1009
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:28,640
or

1010
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
a new uh

1011
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
a new

1012
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,880
indicator of attack going into your edr

1013
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,160
platform

1014
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,599
or

1015
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:38,960
or some other

1016
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,400
some other type of hardening something

1017
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,560
like gpo based hardening

1018
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,480
um

1019
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,920
things like that

1020
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,839
so the guiding force behind the changes

1021
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:50,160
to the security controls are the gaps

1022
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,119
that

1023
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:54,079
us as purple team teamers call out based

1024
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,720
upon the results of our security control

1025
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,040
validation testing phase right

1026
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:01,040
um so the security control hardening

1027
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,880
allows technology owners

1028
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,440
such as endpoint detection response

1029
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,359
email hygiene

1030
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:09,920
and not teams to harden you know the

1031
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:12,640
organization's email network and

1032
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,480
endpoints

1033
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,240
based upon

1034
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,920
our purple team assessment findings

1035
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,160
right

1036
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,480
so this can get complex

1037
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,079
kind of really fast depending on the

1038
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,359
teams that were involved in active

1039
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,240
defense mission um

1040
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,640
as a purple teamer we

1041
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
we try to strive to know just as much as

1042
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:35,040
we know offensively

1043
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,280
as we do defensively so we try to make

1044
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,800
sure that we know enough

1045
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:41,200
um offensively and defensively and also

1046
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,359
about each of these security products

1047
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,359
and controls in our environment so that

1048
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,640
we can best uh best help assist these

1049
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,440
technology owners that are involved uh

1050
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,200
you know edr you know hygiene and things

1051
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
like that so we can help them implement

1052
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,599
these controls uh where they might not

1053
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,000
have enough technical uh depth or

1054
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,839
understanding um of how these

1055
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:06,240
ttps actually work and are executed on a

1056
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,720
host or network

1057
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,680
so

1058
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,160
um red team and purple team technology

1059
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,560
owners edr email hygiene those types of

1060
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,839
teams and again cyber threat

1061
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:19,440
intelligence critical uh to being

1062
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,200
involved in this process

1063
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,320
uh to implement uh control hardening or

1064
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,960
new detections uh new rules and things

1065
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,560
like that

1066
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,200
we have found that sigma works it works

1067
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,560
very well

1068
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,160
because it is vendor

1069
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,520
agnostic again we're able to to develop

1070
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,040
that quickly

1071
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,200
and get that to an appropriate team who

1072
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,440
could then use that sigma rule and

1073
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,720
convert it to be vendor specific and

1074
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,880
implemented and tested a lot a lot

1075
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,280
quicker than just

1076
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,720
you know building something kind of in

1077
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,919
the wind so to speak

1078
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,440
all right so i've talked a lot about the

1079
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,760
process already uh but we'll just cover

1080
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,800
you know some of the steps in the

1081
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,920
process more more specifically so

1082
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:08,800
uh the cti team will leverage purple

1083
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,400
teams current state analysis of the

1084
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,720
security controls uh and give a briefing

1085
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:14,400
to the technology owners

1086
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,520
um and work together to to to design

1087
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
improvements to alerting logic

1088
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,079
um

1089
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,720
uh you know host-based uh

1090
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,640
host-based controls you know based upon

1091
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,560
purple team recommendations

1092
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,720
um the email hygiene

1093
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,040
hygiene team will ensure that they

1094
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,160
create new rules to block known

1095
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
known or suspected turlow fishing attack

1096
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,599
attachments um you know are they coming

1097
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:44,480
in specifically with like ole type of

1098
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,480
documents or pdf

1099
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,160
uh documents or

1100
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,560
docx or just a doc they could take a

1101
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,560
look at that and develop their own

1102
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,320
custom roles for their their email

1103
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,560
security platform

1104
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,480
the edr team

1105
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,560
designs and tests new alerting and

1106
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,960
response logic creating new

1107
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
indicator

1108
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:08,079
indicators of attacks that are very ttp

1109
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:11,760
specific uh do we have run dll making a

1110
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:13,920
an odd process call

1111
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,480
um and then spawning a new process uh

1112
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,000
does this happen

1113
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,720
um within seconds or within minutes um

1114
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,359
edr is the team to take care of more of

1115
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,760
the the host space ttps boots on the

1116
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,560
ground we have a threat executing on a

1117
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,040
host and and that ensures that the

1118
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,560
endpoint sensors will

1119
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
will respond

1120
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,119
appropriately and properly to

1121
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:39,680
our example turtle activity right and

1122
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:42,240
any other you know active active defense

1123
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,119
scenarios uh the knock team uh they'll

1124
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:47,040
they'll evaluate the current ids rule

1125
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,880
sets to determine what rules need to be

1126
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,680
added or activated to detect

1127
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:52,880
whatever command and control

1128
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
communication an adversary like terla is

1129
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,520
using are they using dns do we need to

1130
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,760
take a look at the size of our dns

1131
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,200
request

1132
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:04,240
and determine can we just block any dns

1133
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,359
request that is too large because it's

1134
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,839
uh suspected command and control or we

1135
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,520
know for a fact that

1136
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,040
it would be command and control in our

1137
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:15,200
environment for example

1138
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,599
so some deliverables in this in this

1139
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,599
control hardening phase a list of

1140
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:21,520
security control improvements

1141
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,079
um and metrics on on time to improve the

1142
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,520
security control so you'll notice the

1143
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,599
trend here we're taking a lot of

1144
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,640
a lot of metrics uh so we can measure

1145
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,599
each phase of the process um and along

1146
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,680
the way as we do these throughout

1147
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,440
you know throughout time

1148
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,000
we can see where our processes are

1149
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,680
either efficient or not efficient and

1150
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:43,440
improve those processes throughout each

1151
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,440
phase to get better and better so we can

1152
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,520
complete one of these active defense

1153
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:52,960
missions faster get uh detections

1154
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,119
um and controls harden

1155
00:41:55,119 --> 00:41:56,160
uh

1156
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,400
faster and more efficiently uh which

1157
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,960
leads us to being more secure

1158
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
quicker

1159
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,800
which is the goal

1160
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,560
um so these are

1161
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,000
this is another uh another screenshot of

1162
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,640
security control hardening results

1163
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,640
this is

1164
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,960
taking a look at again minor attack tack

1165
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,760
it tactic minor attack uh technique that

1166
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,839
we specifically tested uh from the

1167
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:24,720
purple team side um and did new endpoint

1168
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,280
detection logic get created you know

1169
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,800
what uh did new ids rules get created

1170
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,359
um things like that so we can say

1171
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,240
um

1172
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,480
you know we can say that we created uh

1173
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:40,640
new edr detections uh for all of these

1174
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:42,560
uh ttps that were executed during the

1175
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,160
active defense mission but we couldn't

1176
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
create new ids rules

1177
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,079
because some were not applicable but

1178
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,000
it's good to show that right because we

1179
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,240
don't want we don't want these teams

1180
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,920
thinking that like oh we need to try to

1181
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,560
make a rule as an ids

1182
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,640
to take a look at uh

1183
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,240
you know powershell being executed on

1184
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,240
endpoint or something like that because

1185
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:04,400
again they might not have the the

1186
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,640
offensive technical depth to realize

1187
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,079
that they wouldn't need to do something

1188
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:09,040
like that

1189
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:10,079
um

1190
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:13,040
plus it helps us as an organization

1191
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:15,200
understand the coverage that we have

1192
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
across our security controls

1193
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:21,200
um related to turlock

1194
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,359
uh so we're rolling into security

1195
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,800
control validation retesting as as uh

1196
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,319
robert has highlighted as part of the

1197
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,480
process uh we conduct that initial

1198
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,160
security control

1199
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,440
uh test

1200
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:38,400
and then uh control hardening is

1201
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,240
is completed so we move to the next

1202
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,119
phase of retesting our controls

1203
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:46,079
so a security control validation retest

1204
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:49,599
is the same exact thing as the initial

1205
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:52,560
security control validation test it is a

1206
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,480
one for one

1207
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:57,119
nothing should change your ttp should be

1208
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:00,480
executed exactly in the same manner as

1209
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,640
you did the first time that you did

1210
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,280
security control validation testing

1211
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
if it isn't it doesn't it no longer is a

1212
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:10,240
retest it becomes a whole new text so we

1213
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,319
want to do our best to avoid

1214
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
uh to avoid making changes like that

1215
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
unless there's some very crazy specific

1216
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:18,880
reason for that to change it should

1217
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:21,040
never change during retest

1218
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,000
so i would do this so we do this to to

1219
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,319
check ourselves right so we just did all

1220
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,480
that security control hardening and now

1221
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:31,440
we need to reestablish what our

1222
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,000
our new efficacy is of our

1223
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,240
organizational security controls after

1224
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,680
they have been hardened based on the

1225
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,440
techniques used by the adversary of

1226
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,160
interest turling in this case right

1227
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:45,040
and again this is similar to

1228
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,720
the first security control validation

1229
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:50,240
test you know red or purple team and ctr

1230
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:53,919
are heavily involved in this phase

1231
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,560
um again similar very very similar one

1232
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,599
to one right so purple team has the

1233
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:04,240
attack model already from cti provided

1234
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:07,119
intelligence uh purple team again runs

1235
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,680
an automator a manual test of turlo's in

1236
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,040
the law of techniques to test the

1237
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,880
efficacy of the organization's security

1238
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,000
controls

1239
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,599
um reusing the previously provided minor

1240
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:21,359
attack threat right so one to one

1241
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:23,440
purple team produces

1242
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,920
a another current state analysis of the

1243
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,839
organization security controls that are

1244
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:30,079
in the scope of the aed mission and then

1245
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,319
purple team takes that and produced the

1246
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:33,839
cti team

1247
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:36,240
with the new measurement uh of the

1248
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,640
security control validation assessment

1249
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,760
results and

1250
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,760
any new recommendations that that might

1251
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,920
come out of that right so it

1252
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
um during the retest you know uh

1253
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,359
somebody

1254
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,400
might have implemented an incorrect uh

1255
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:52,480
you know endpoint detection

1256
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,440
uh rule or you know something got messed

1257
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,200
up during implement implementation of

1258
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,200
that role or testing that role um and it

1259
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:01,040
wasn't covered specifically to the ttp

1260
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,880
that was tested

1261
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,520
this retest will uncover that or should

1262
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,040
uncover that right that's what we're

1263
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,720
that's what we're looking for and then

1264
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,720
another

1265
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:13,200
another recommendation can be built

1266
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,800
and more assistance can be provided

1267
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:15,599
right

1268
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:17,119
um

1269
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:19,040
so phase deliverable security control

1270
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,720
validation assessment results security

1271
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:23,280
control improvement recommendations and

1272
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,720
then metrics on the security controls

1273
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,640
again right we're metro sizing every

1274
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:28,960
step of the way uh so we know what is

1275
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,720
efficient and what is working for us

1276
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:32,880
where do we need to

1277
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:35,119
assist more more heavily with another

1278
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,560
team or or something like that right

1279
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:39,280
so

1280
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,280
same chart we've seen it in a previous

1281
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,000
previous slides minor attack tactic mire

1282
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,359
attack technique

1283
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:47,599
uh pre-emission endpoint detection rate

1284
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:50,160
right you can see in our example

1285
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,680
pre-mission

1286
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,359
we didn't have very good coverage in a

1287
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,760
lot of areas but post mission after that

1288
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:58,000
security control hardening uh we're now

1289
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,359
100

1290
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,040
uh covered on our detection rate across

1291
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,839
uh the entire tested uh attack life

1292
00:47:05,839 --> 00:47:08,079
cycle right so this builds confidence

1293
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,319
within the organization that we are

1294
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,359
protected from from turla based ttps

1295
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,680
you know until they decide to

1296
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,079
to uh develop new ones right which is

1297
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:22,880
why this process should be continuous

1298
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,880
but this gives leaders the the

1299
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,640
organization as a whole

1300
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,680
um you know a view of where we were and

1301
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,240
where we're at now um and building that

1302
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,720
confidence with your leadership uh based

1303
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,880
upon these types of missions and results

1304
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,880
it's critical to to becoming uh you know

1305
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,599
or having a world-class security program

1306
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:46,400
in my opinion

1307
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:50,240
all right reporting and lessons learned

1308
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:53,440
my favorite oh yeah all right yeah so

1309
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,880
let's talk a little bit about the keys

1310
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:58,559
to a success successful mission recap

1311
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:01,040
you need to have an executive summary um

1312
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,119
doing this for a while now i can tell

1313
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,680
you that if you keep it to one page

1314
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:07,280
it will be really appreciated by your

1315
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,400
leaders

1316
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,000
uh it's not that they don't want to read

1317
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,760
your reports i know i've turned in

1318
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,760
reports over 100 pages

1319
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,720
but

1320
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,160
it's all they have time to do is read

1321
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,119
the executive summary

1322
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:21,200
in a similar vein of thought use

1323
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,760
graphics uh you can represent a several

1324
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:26,400
paragraphs in a single chart to it it'll

1325
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:28,480
go a long way in ensuring that

1326
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:30,319
your leadership team appreciates the

1327
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:32,160
style of reporting you have

1328
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,640
keep it as simple where possible

1329
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,319
don't trust don't use this as an

1330
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:38,079
opportunity to show how awesome and

1331
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:39,440
technical you are

1332
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:40,319
uh

1333
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:42,160
the point of the mission is for the

1334
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,480
consumer to understand and get value out

1335
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,920
of your report

1336
00:48:45,920 --> 00:48:47,440
have a style guide and follow it to

1337
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,880
ensure the document is congruent

1338
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,000
throughout

1339
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,200
i have

1340
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,839
many times gone through reports where

1341
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:55,920
the style of writing changes midway

1342
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:58,960
through and it absolutely

1343
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:01,359
detracts from the value of the report

1344
00:49:01,359 --> 00:49:02,800
by having a style guide there's a

1345
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:04,559
step-by-step process you or your

1346
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,720
analysts can follow in creating the

1347
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,280
documentation reporting and your

1348
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,880
consumer knows what they're going to get

1349
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:12,960
every time they read your reports it

1350
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:14,880
establishes that trust rob was talking

1351
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,720
about

1352
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,960
seek feedback of draft versions before

1353
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:21,119
sharing it out that seems like something

1354
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:23,920
simple but even if you're not getting

1355
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,079
concrete recommendations

1356
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:27,119
push on

1357
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:29,599
the individuals or groups that you have

1358
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,359
look at your reporting see where you can

1359
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,280
do better highlight the successes and

1360
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:35,520
failures of the mission

1361
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,520
an opportunity for improvement no matter

1362
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:39,920
the result so even if the mission went

1363
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,839
perfect look for opportunities to

1364
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,760
improve it and if there were failures

1365
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,200
that's a good thing you're the one

1366
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,520
testing it you're not perla

1367
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,440
in our scenario

1368
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,359
include a recognition section to share

1369
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,599
credit with all members involved

1370
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,359
it's not one team or another it's

1371
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,040
teamwork makes the dream work cyber

1372
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,040
security is a team sport i have a lot

1373
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,960
more of these and i don't want to get

1374
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,720
annoying with you all but

1375
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,599
in reality it's important for everyone

1376
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:07,599
to work together these missions only

1377
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:09,680
work if multiple teams share their

1378
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:10,880
resources

1379
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,040
and focus under the idea and accept the

1380
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,319
belief that

1381
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,280
this actor that we're emulating or this

1382
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,440
campaign we're emulating this now we're

1383
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,559
emulating

1384
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:22,160
is important for us to test because

1385
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,599
there's a realistic threat on our

1386
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:25,920
organization and we're all here to keep

1387
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:28,400
the organization safe

1388
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,520
you know the next slide please rob

1389
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:34,400
remember your target audience let's say

1390
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:35,839
it one more time remember your target

1391
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:36,800
audience

1392
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,800
if you're writing to the csil it's

1393
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:40,240
different than writing to your security

1394
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,839
operations manager

1395
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:43,839
know who you're talking to and how to

1396
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,440
consider having variations of your

1397
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,520
report for those stakeholders i just

1398
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,839
mentioned by tailoring it to that

1399
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:51,440
specific audience

1400
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:53,040
that consumer will get more out of the

1401
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,440
report and be able to do more with the

1402
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:57,280
work you've done

1403
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:59,200
reporting gaps or issues at the end of

1404
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,119
the mission make sure that anything that

1405
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:02,960
you haven't fixed or remediating is

1406
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:04,079
called out

1407
00:51:04,079 --> 00:51:06,839
use your organization's methodology for

1408
00:51:06,839 --> 00:51:08,960
findings and tailor it to your

1409
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,960
organization's methodology

1410
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,559
again it's about the consumers it's

1411
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,559
about somebody being able to consume the

1412
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,480
gaps that you've called out and then

1413
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:19,599
work to fix them in the long term

1414
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,839
good recommendations are underpinned by

1415
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,359
industry standard and accepted

1416
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,200
methodologies of frameworks

1417
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:28,480
cough cough nist uh it's important for

1418
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:30,720
you to bring it back to industry

1419
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,599
standard

1420
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:34,240
and accepted methodologies that adds

1421
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,359
more

1422
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:37,520
fodder to the fire it makes

1423
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:39,680
it makes more like you're more likely

1424
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,280
that your consumers will accept the

1425
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,160
recommendations you're providing them

1426
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,480
and most importantly always hold a post

1427
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:48,000
mission debrief with all parties who

1428
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,280
participated

1429
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,119
you will be able to get amazing

1430
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:52,960
improvement ideas on things you never

1431
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,200
even thought of as a mission leader and

1432
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,920
i've run many of these i can tell you

1433
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,160
that every time i hold the post mission

1434
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:02,160
debrief we come up with something new

1435
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,319
and a way to improve our missions and i

1436
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:06,160
can say i think the missions we run now

1437
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,720
are pretty damn good

1438
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,559
they get better every time because of

1439
00:52:10,559 --> 00:52:13,440
having this post mission debrief

1440
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
next slide please

1441
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,760
so lessons learned after action

1442
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:18,880
reporting

1443
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:22,079
so this is a fun slide this helps

1444
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,839
those who have difficulties with lessons

1445
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,000
learned in a very simple way you look to

1446
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,760
answer what happened

1447
00:52:27,760 --> 00:52:29,839
and what was supposed to happen what can

1448
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:31,760
we learn about what actually happened

1449
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,960
and why was there a difference if

1450
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,559
there's a difference

1451
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,800
so we make sure that we keep actions are

1452
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,359
observed facts and evidence

1453
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:41,760
and then we try to keep out shared

1454
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:43,920
opinions and perceptions and really

1455
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,160
stick to what actually occurred and the

1456
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,440
facts that back up what what happened

1457
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,119
anything you want to add on after action

1458
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:53,440
or lesson

1459
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:56,000
um i agree with robert you know removing

1460
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,599
your opinion

1461
00:52:57,599 --> 00:52:59,359
as much as possible

1462
00:52:59,359 --> 00:53:01,440
especially with failures it can be

1463
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:03,200
difficult

1464
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:04,800
um but

1465
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
clearly laying out the facts and showing

1466
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,119
the evidence and speaking to that

1467
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,520
it goes a long way it removes

1468
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,280
you know the bias that you might have

1469
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,839
based upon a failure or success

1470
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,000
um if your team succeeded

1471
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:18,960
um

1472
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,720
you know you might feel really good

1473
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,400
about that and you might have a lot to

1474
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,520
say

1475
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:25,040
that that kind of drives you being

1476
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:26,720
biased in your opinion about the other

1477
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,359
teams or something like that

1478
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:32,400
you have to remove that

1479
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,440
all right next slide sir

1480
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,200
