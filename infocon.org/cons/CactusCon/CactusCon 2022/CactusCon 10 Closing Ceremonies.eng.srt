[Music]

this conference can't happen without

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,560
volunteers i know people look at me like

70
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,800
i've done a lot but i can tell you

71
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,960
especially this year i've done almost

72
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,479
nothing i'm very proud of myself for

73
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:47,759
that

74
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,000
i founded the event uh

75
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,840
10 years ago and i've spent i've spent

76
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,320
my dues as lead organizer and kind of

77
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,639
pretty face and then i got older and so

78
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,560
now it's a less pretty face

79
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,680
um

80
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
last couple of years ryan chapman has

81
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
stepped up and he's been our primary

82
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,280
organizer but due to

83
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
just a family life situation that that

84
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,520
is you know unfortunate and i hope he's

85
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,800
working through that ryan couldn't be

86
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,039
here today and so this is why i'm here

87
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,280
doing closing ceremony kind of last

88
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:16,479
minute putting this all together

89
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:18,320
otherwise you would be talking to to

90
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,000
ryan about all of this so

91
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,360
first off a special thanks to him

92
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,800
because because without that you know

93
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,400
leadership this really

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
this is a reflection of his work i told

95
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,240
him when he took over the job that the

96
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,479
good news is by the time you get to this

97
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,000
point it's going to happen one way or

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,680
the other right so there's no point in

99
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,160
freaking out you know and your job is

100
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,400
almost to like try to hold on to the

101
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,919
steering wheel a little bit to make sure

102
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,080
everything doesn't fall off and and for

103
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,520
the folks who know we've had a handful

104
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
of you know incidents that come up this

105
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,479
year and i think we've done a pretty

106
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,560
good job of navigating them but but

107
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,400
again thank you to ryan i'm really

108
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,680
really thankful for the work that he's

109
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,840
done um alex in the back he's gonna come

110
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,600
up and talk in a minute uh he is the

111
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,440
gentleman behind all of the discord all

112
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,000
the streaming all the video like this

113

guy's one one one stop shop for

114
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,520
everything he's been doing so much

115
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,120
behind the scenes to make this happen so

116
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,199
if you're listening in digitally and

117
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,720
you've been in discord and you've been

118
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,479
doing any of the interactions with all

119
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,880
of that that's all been alex and his

120
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,360
work in fact a lot of art as well for

121
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,440
this year and the the way that we've

122
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,039
done slides and put this together that's

123
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,960
that's been all alex too so

124
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,039
the work from him has been phenomenal

125
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,440
and so special thanks to alex uh for

126
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,560
that

127
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
uh jamie who is just up here i think

128
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
actually also with alex has been

129
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,639
managing all of our talks and

130
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
submissions and working on

131
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
the

132
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,280
board to review all of those so if

133
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,199
you've been a speaker here you've been a

134
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,199
part of what we've done jamie has has

135
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,639
been a big part of reviewing that and

136
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,400
leading it which is which is a huge

137
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,319
effort all on its own right i think a

138
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:48,160
lot of people don't sort of give that

139
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
credit but if you were here for this

140
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
last talk with the panel you kind of got

141
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,319
to see a little bit about the behind the

142
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,160
scenes pieces that jamie and her team

143
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,080
kind of go through to pick pick what

144
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,680
that means to be a high quality talk

145
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,319
here within the conference um haley here

146
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
on the front has been awesome for all

147
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,639
things digital media so if you like the

148
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,479
fact that the cactus con account

149
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
actually is active for more than like

150
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,479
five minutes in a year thank you to

151
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,479
haley like everything digital and

152
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,000
everything online has been has been

153
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,800
haley when we started you know there was

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,560
only three we started we had a pretty

155
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,479
big team but it was about three of us

156
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,400
trying to do almost all the same things

157
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,479
that these teams have been doing and so

158
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:27,840
you kind of pick and choose your battles

159
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:30,479
but having someone who can be more of a

160
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,639
community outreach media relations and

161
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,400
building that presence for us

162
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,080

209
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,680
villages so if you've been to any of the

210
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,600
villages this year this is a group that

211
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,360
manages and organizes that between the

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,600
two of them and so it's just again it's

213
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,519
such a big it takes a community to run

214
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,040
this event that's why i want to walk you

215
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,399
through and see like

216
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,080
all the people behind the scenes who

217
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,920
who've kind of made that happen

218
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:27,839
um eric os i don't know if he's still

219
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,760
here maybe eric

220
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,680
he helped design the badges and he's

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,360
been a big part of badge stuff for the

222
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
last several years here within cactus

223
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,399
con as i mentioned before we had a

224
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,160
hardware badge for this year and if you

225
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:43,040
can see it here on my my shiny

226
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
it was prototyped out we know what we

227
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,160
want to do

228
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,080
when we went to go order pipes it was

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,480
like a year wait time because of a ship

230
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,240
shortage everything we wanted to get was

231
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,360
just gone

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,480
and so

233
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,080
the good news is there's no risk in not

234
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,839
getting a badge for next year i think we

235
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,279
already know what we're doing so we've

236
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,480
got we've got that designed

237
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,079
so i think for the first time since i've

238
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:05,760
ever been at cactus con we're like we're

239
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,279
ahead on badges so congratulations us

240
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
um so that's cool and and that in this

241
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,240
of itself is like it's such a genius

242
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,079
thing the badges for the people who

243
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
haven't ever had one of these they're

244
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,880
like fully functional electronic boards

245
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,560
that do something and we try to make

246
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,959
them interesting and compelling that

247
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,880
even during the event you can actually

248
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,560
go we have a heatsink who we partner

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
with which is where eric is a part of

250
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,880
and his in his kind of crew they come

251
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,880
out and they actually show you how to

252
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,959
build these badges so if you don't know

253
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,640
anything about hardware hacking if you

254
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,160
don't know anything about this type of

255
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,920
tech and things of this sort that's okay

256
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,440
you don't have to we've actually had a

257
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
whole village for almost every single

258
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,920
year helping design and build and create

259
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,240
these like you know pieces one year we

260
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,240
had a passive reconnaissance network tap

261
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,240
that you could plug in and like pull

262
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,399
stuff right off the wire i mean a couple

263
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:57,920
years we've had

264
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,000
cool like digital communication types of

265
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,760
things and like every year they come up

266
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,160
with something and it's great so

267
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,360
that's kind of the core team right

268
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,519
behind the scenes on top of that we have

269
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,160
villages right so villages

270
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,920
these take individuals who have kind of

271
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,600
their own teams and manage specialty

272
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,399

next year where they want to kind of

289
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,200
take that to the next level and have

290
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,560
this as a permanent village here at

291
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,760
cactus con

292
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,760
um thank you to rachel

293
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,600
rachel ran the

294
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,600
career village we keep saying changing

295
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,200
the name of it what is it now interview

296
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,560
village

297
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,440
career village

298
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,200
so it's a hiring village

299
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,320
but not

300
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,040
it's a career

301
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,320
so it's a career village but not hiring

302
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,880
it's a hiring

303
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,720
it's all very clear

304
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,440
so uh i think it's a big opportunity i

305
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,959
think it's great i know a lot of people

306
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:18,480
who come to cactus con even the way that

307
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
we designed it from the beginning was to

308
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,320
give people their

309
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,000
first sort of foothold into this

310
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
industry that's what we wanted to do

311
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
with it and so we knew

312
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
you know arizona at the time and we had

313
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,880
a hundred people show up to the first

314
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,959
b-sides the diverse cactus con and we

315
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,560
knew that we needed to help people find

316
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:36,480
a way to get access to this information

317
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,040
and and part of it is is about job

318
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,560
building and career building and the

319
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,399
skill building that goes into it so

320
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
always been a big fan of that as

321
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,680
something we can do and i'm just

322
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,959
thankful that rachel was here to run

323
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,040
that village this year as well

324
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,000

333
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,040
actually started having a ctf here

334
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,000
because uh joe demessie who's not here

335
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,519
had another conference where he created

336
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:14,880
a ctf and he didn't he loved this etf he

337
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
didn't love building a conference and i

338
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,320
said i got a i got a room i could stick

339
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
you in and i'll manage everything else

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,079
and we've had a ctf ever since then

341
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,760
since i think actually

342
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,079
the second year we did we did cactus con

343
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:26,880
so

344
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,079
i'm excited that we've been able to

345
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:29,440
continue to push that forward and

346
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,040

in his own like plane he like

382
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,639

i didn't even want to drive here i got a

384
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:44,800
hotel room and i was like i'm gonna walk

385
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,680

386
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,880
that's something

387
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,199
uh emilio i don't know emilio but he

388
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:51,279
stepped up in a big way this year emilio

389
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,320
hi emilio uh we had we had a last-minute

390
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,160
change in terms of monitoring the rooms

391
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,600
and making sure the talks kind of went

392
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,600
off and emilio stepped up and ran all

393
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:00,959
that and so

394
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,360
we wanted to call call that out tim has

395
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
been a long time runner here and

396
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,279
volunteer cactus con runners just

397
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,880
literally run things and make sure

398
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,320
everything is happening that needs to

399
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,920
happen you know when you have an event

400
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,399
this big i'm sure you probably get tired

401
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,720
walking from place to place um and in

402
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
the same way like if we have to move

403
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,000
stuff you know back and forth throughout

404
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,279
the event these guys have done an

405
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,440
awesome job making sure that that works

406
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,279
and we can get that working there too

407
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,160
behind the scenes brandon p and jason

408
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,519
and caitlin have been helping with all

409
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,000
the stuff online for discord here in the

410
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,240
building so we have the discord stuff

411
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,160
last year we had everything digital so

412
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,720
we pre-recorded i think all the talks

413
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,720
and then we had live q a for everybody

414
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,079
behind the scenes and there was a team

415
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
behind it writing automation and bots

416
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
and getting discord working this year

417
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,880
because of a hybrid nature we were both

418
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,040
streaming things into the conference and

419
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
then out of the conference back out to

420
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,399
people in discord all kind of at the

421
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,959
same time and so the team behind it they

422
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,880
actually had members in each room making

423
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,320
sure that that was functioning and

424
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
working and managed correctly across

425
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,560
each group and they did a phenomenal job

426
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,399
i can't speak for the folks online but

427
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,480
as far as i've heard you know maybe a

428
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,000
handful of small problems but they work

429
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,959
through all of them and they work

430
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,480
through all of them really fast and so

431
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,959
like that experience is a big a big deal

432
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,880
for us as a conference and i wanted to

433
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,519
call that out specifically

434
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,360
last but not least

435
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,880
i want to thank the volunteers so all

436
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,079
the folks here

437
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:29,600
uh in aqua color green we'll go with

438
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,240
that aqua green

439
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,560
it's heather teal

440
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,399
sure we'll go with that

441
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,360
um

442
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,040
like i said it takes it takes a village

443
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,800
and some of it happens before the event

444
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,240
happens and a lot of it happens while

445
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,880
we're here and so uh with that i wanna i

446
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,240
know i've gone through like all these

447
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,079
people but a round of applause to all of

448
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,820

happen

456
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:11,679

they've been here working just as hard

629
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
if not harder than anybody else in terms

630
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,039
of the team so i want to especially call

631
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,720

632

literally wouldn't happen without you

635
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,559
guys like seriously so

636
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:03,440
uh in terms of some statistics we had a

637
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:06,720
little bit over 500 people here uh over

638
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
the last two days which is actually

639
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:09,919
really exciting in the middle of a

640
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,600
pandemic you know you never know how

641
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:12,960
this will play out

642
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,279
i'm excited that we had this many people

643
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,039
willing to kind of work together in a

644
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,200
safe way to do this

645
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,679
we had about 360-ish people the first

646
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,559
day

647
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:25,120
and then we had i'm guessing about 200

648
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,320
so people

649
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,480
uh a little bit this day right and

650
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,480
between kind of those two adding in the

651
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,640
volunteers we we get to a little bit

652
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:35,760
over 500 in total attendance in person

653
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,440
but online we had 785 people jump online

654
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,440
to be a part of this which means this

655
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,440
conference is coming in just shy of

656
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,559
about 300 people which is like almost

657
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,480
almost the exact same numbers we've seen

658
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,000
the last couple of years which is like i

659
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,919
said absolutely amazing that people

660
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,279
would want to be a part of it and

661
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,600
continue to support it as we grow and

662
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:57,919
develop this as a community so thank you

00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,320
discord so a lot of interaction i think

666
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,400
when people think digital conference

667
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,919
they just feel like i'm going to look at

668
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,240
videos online and then like you know

669
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:12,880
trash talk on like some some channel but

670
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,960
like no the people are interacting

671
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,279

672
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
interaction with audience here and like

673
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,000
that technology and their ability to do

674
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,840
the hybrid that way is is amazing and

675
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,000
you can see that there's been a lot of

676
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,679
interaction digitally just as much as

called it a bishop fox line we had two

711
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,640
wi-fi adapters i saw somebody walking

712
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,880
around with a huge antenna i hope you

713
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,520
found uh found the two aps that we had

714
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,440
out there we just snuck them one in the

715
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,480
bush here and then one underneath the uh

716
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
the vending machine

717
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,000
we had this really cool rubik's cube

718
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,159
challenge if you didn't see that mike

719
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,480
created that we had a qr code and you

720
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,000
had a scrambled up rubik's cube that you

721
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,400
had to solve and then once you solve

722
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
that you would knew you would know what

723
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
blocks on the qr code to color in and

724
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
then it would scan uh to be a flag that

725
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,960
one that was pretty cool

726
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,600
we had uh uh juicy here did this uh did

727
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,799
this qr

728
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,679
code sort of um like 10 stage scavenger

729
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,240
hunt uh we had we had them all over the

730
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,000
area here some riddles it was all based

731
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,080
off of the the matrix theme

732
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,760
hopefully uh hopefully some of you had a

733
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,520
good time looking at that

734
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,919
now um one thing that we did on purpose

735
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,240
is that we split the scoreboard between

736
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,200
virtual only attendees and uh and then

737
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
the folks that were in person uh the one

738
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,039
reason we did that is because we run

739
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,760
quite a few ctfs and we have a few uh

740
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,000
big hitting teams that i feel like all

741
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,919
they do is play cts because they come in

742
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,000
and just crush them uh they actually

743
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,799
cleared the scoreboard on day one

744
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,399
um and then we had the in-person one

745
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,640
with all the the in-person challenges to

746
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,760
make sure that it was still still

747
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,840
competitive i'm going to hand it off to

00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,360

00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,679
we had 138 in person

829
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,559
players with 43 teams and 225 ip

830
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,679
addresses

831
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,039
so

832
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,440
cut over for virtual so just the whole

833
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,399
top ten here for top nine that we got

834
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:07,919
here so you can see here

835
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:09,679
uh so the virtual

836
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:12,000
coming in fourth is cosmos followed by a

837
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,600
neutrino cannon

838
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,960
we've heard them before we figured their

839
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,559
place better but it was you know we're

840
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,519
glad they placed uh wolf packets

841
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,880
followed by

842
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,799
i don't even know how to pronounce that

843
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,559
russian

844
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,240
and then shadow brokers and thundercats

845
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,200
so

846
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
in person though this is kind of what i

847
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,559
what i enjoyed seeing everyone out here

848
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,559

849
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:40,639

851
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,080

857
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,000
pilgrimage for all of us we enjoy coming

858
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,000

859
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,840
time we enjoyed doing this hybrid so

860

869
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,840
sponsors again so thank you all for

870
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,360
having us really appreciate it thanks

871
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,439
for playing

872
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,559
in our grand tradition of giveaways i

873
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,399
want to invite rachel up to talk a

874
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,880
little bit about the career village

875
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,760
that's not hiring the hiring

876
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,880
hiring village it's not a career

877
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:53,760
a scavenger hunt

878
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,720
oh and helper and there's a helper so

879
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:57,519
yes

880
00:32:57,519 --> 00:32:59,760
plot twist uh so

881
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,360
what's the difference between a career

882
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,519
village and a hiring village a hiring

883
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,440
village you can get a job um there's

884
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,360
definitely some of the volunteers knew

885
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,640
about jobs that kind of thing but we

886
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,960
were really focusing on the skills

887
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,559
process right

888
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,279
so we did mock interviews we reviewed

889
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,600
resumes we talked about career paths

890
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,760
those types of things and really honored

891
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,200
to have about

892
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,600
just close to two dozen volunteers that

893
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,000
spent either a couple of hours or you

894
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,919
know the whole day several people spent

895
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,960
two days we had a ceo come in and spend

896
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,519
two full days and give all of his time

897
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:36,720
to share his his knowledge so

898
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,279
awesome and we wanted to be sure to

899
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,559

900
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:43,600

936
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,400
what just happened here did i miss this

937
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,320
did we stream it

938
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,760
all right

939
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:53,599
so uh before we get to giveaways i

940
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,040
always like to talk about the money this

941
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,160
is a non-profit organization uh

942
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,000
you know it's an actual federally

943
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,680
government recognized

944
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,599
nonprofit

945
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:07,040
this year between actual sponsors

946
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
and the community again this is people

947
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,440
who just donated cash

948
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,880
um we were a little bit over ninety

949
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,839
thousand dollars in in that sort of

950
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,920
earnings i guess right donations

951
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,440
um so

952
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,960
you might ask yourself where does that

953
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,720
all go where do we do with ninety

954
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,240
thousand dollars because it seems it

955
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,520
seems like a lot

956
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,640
about half of it this year went into av

957
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
right to be able to stream and all of

958
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,640
the things that kind of come along with

959
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,480
managing the actual event and the

960
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,640
conference the largest portion of

961
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:39,520
spending was here

962
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,200
the next biggest one of course is the

963
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,040
venue the venue

964
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,119
we have to book it out several years

965
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,200
sort of in advance or we typically make

966
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,960
a contract to keep the dates that we

967
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,480
want to have

968
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,400
and the rest were split between things

969
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:54,640
like the swag the t-shirts the the

970
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,040
lanyards the masks all the things we

971
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,880
bought for the event

972
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,640
the art and the print is sort of a

973
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:03,200
portion of it here

974
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,640
there's an operational piece we've got

975
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,400
to pay to have people come out we've got

976
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,839
to help people who come in from out of

977
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:09,280
state this is a part of running a

978
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,280
conference and so we use this so we

979
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,960
could keep them here and give them kind

980
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,720
of that benefit of being a part of it

981
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
and invite them out

982
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,640
uh and then the last bit was legal and

983
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,839
accounting but

984
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,359
depending on how the next couple weeks

985
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:24,799
go that might that might be larger

986
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,280
so uh that leaves us with you know a

987
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:32,160
little bit over 16 ish thousand dollars

988
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
that sort of sits in the bank

989
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,960
that money actually goes directly into

990
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,280
next year's conference and so when we're

991
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,520
when we book the reservation we pay it

992
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,839
over the year uh so that the last thing

993
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:45,520
we do is we pay off the final balance at

994
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:47,760
the end of the event and so while it

995
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:49,440
looks like oh you know why do we have

996
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,280
all this money sitting around just

997
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,520
understand that's so we could do this in

998
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,880
a way that's responsible from a

999
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:57,040
corporate perspective when we first ran

1000
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,800
the conference we did not figure that

1001
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:00,880
out very well and so we were just

1002
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,119
literally gambling salaries to determine

1003
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:04,960
if we could get enough sponsors as we

1004
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,320
would pay for the event ahead of time

1005
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,040
anyways right so um

1006
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,640
so we think we got that figured out

1007
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,000
moving forward

1008
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,480
um with that that's kind of the end of

1009
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,640
our our closing ceremony we're going to

1010
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,760

1089
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,160
cactus con closing as our time-honored

1090
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,200
tradition

1091
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,960
is this is your chance to ask us

1092
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,319
questions and uh and get answers usually

1093
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:01,839
what i'd like to ask you first and

1094
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:03,280
foremost is

1095
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,760
what what did we miss right we try every

1096
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,520
year to improve we're trying every year

1097
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,280
to continue to offer interesting things

1098
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,200
to people i mean obviously with the

1099
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:13,839
pandemic we had to make some concessions

1100
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,000
we do plan on reintroducing cactus con

1101
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,720
kids as soon as the pandemic allows we

1102
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,040
are looking to have the hardware badges

1103
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,280
and hardware hacking next year but but

1104
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:25,200
apart from that like what would you say

1105
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,599
you want to add any features questions

1106
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,079
comments about cactus con now is your

1107
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:32,560
your last chance before

1108
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:35,040
we drink

1109
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,800
which means you're holding up

1110
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:46,319
come on you don't have to be

1111
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:48,160
can you save us from the digital

1112
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:51,040
armageddon probably not i don't think we

1113
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:54,839
can stop that from happening

1114
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,520
that is a great question what our dates

1115
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,160
are for next year um if my wife was

1116
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,200
still here she probably knows

1117
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,280
we're working with the convention center

1118
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,520
to get those solidified i'll say that

1119
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,359
typically we'll know within the next

1120
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:11,359
couple weeks after the conference last

1121
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,440
year was an interesting one like we knew

1122
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,880
we knew the first two because we had

1123
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,040
those reservations but because of the

1124
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,200
pandemic we moved our contract we had a

1125
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,119
three-year contract out

1126
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,720
but i think we're currently negotiating

1127
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,960
it'll be around the same time of year

1128
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,400
for next year that's what we're shooting

1129
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:28,960
for is to continue to be in this like

1130
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,520
february march time frame i know that's

1131
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,200
tough you had to choose between us and

1132
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,880
the renaissance festival

1133
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,240
uh

1134
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,520
that's right now so

1135
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,040
that will explain where at least a

1136
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,480
hundred or so of the people were

1137
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,640
yeah

1138
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
but i mean why not both right why not

1139
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,240
both

1140
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,319
any other questions about

1141
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,640
the conference

1142
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,560
yeah i like that idea

1143
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,160
all right

1144
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:00,000
okay so the great thing about the

1145
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,880
conference being at the delta

1146
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:06,000
is that uh we have the conference room

1147
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,160
uh until midnight tonight and so if

1148
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,839
you're staying here at the delta or

1149
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:11,599
you're in the area we're planning on

1150
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:13,280
doing kind of a little bit just hanging

1151
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,400
out there and figuring out food you can

1152
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
get booze right from the hotel and then

1153
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:20,480
walk them over and then we'll figure out

1154
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,640
how to eat after that right some

1155
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,000
combination

1156
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,160
yeah we'll figure it out we'll get food

1157
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,200
i mean

1158
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:28,400
we'll probably figure out the food

1159
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,880
before we drink
