um

16
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,040
so let's take a look and see

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,120
what we've got

18
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,800
we have people saying great talk which

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,840
it was uh looking into the c2 matrix

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,039
good ideas

21
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,160
um

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
so you know in in your talk you

23
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,199
mentioned something about talking to

24
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:53,360
your boss and for a lot of people this

25
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,399
is going to be a really intimidating and

26
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,039
awkward conversation uh do you have any

27
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,520
recommendations of how you would start

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,199
that conversation or ask for that

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
conversation with your boss

30
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
uh yeah so

31
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
um

32
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,200
i don't know that everyone is as

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,080
intimidated talking to their immediate

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,000
boss but i think that's the first

35
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,439
starting point which also even if you

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,680
are intimidated talking to your boss

37
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,759
is recognizing everybody else has a boss

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,560
and as we go further up that chain

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
the less they have any clue about what

40
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,200
you do right they're they're busy doing

41
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,360
other things and that's one of the key

42
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,439
takeaways that i wanted to imprint with

43
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,560
everyone is that understanding that

44
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,479
in cyber security we get frustrated a

45
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,079
lot because like why don't they get it

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
why doesn't the business understand and

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,439
appreciate what we're doing

48
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:44,320
and

49
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,000
the reality is they're doing for the

50
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,159
most part just fine without us until

51
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,399
that very moment of course when when

52
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:52,320
what we were predicting would happen

53
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
does happen

54
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,759
um and so i'm trying to help you know

55
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,280
we're talking with your boss

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,439
understanding their boss their pressures

57
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,280
what they're trying to do and then how

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,799
that aligns with the business itself

59
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,280
will reduce your frustration as well as

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,878
hopefully head off some of those things

61
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,520
before they they do happen

62
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,800
oh yeah so in terms of how to do that um

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,599
i mean

64
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,120
there's no reason to have an adversarial

65
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,560
relationship with your boss they're a

66
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
human being too

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,319
so starting with little things

68
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,480
establishing small talk

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,319
um how's the weather what did you think

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,840
what did you do last weekend i mean it

71
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,840
sounds silly but it's a starting point

72
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,200
to a conversation where you can then

73
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,560
start to feel more comfortable with

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:35,120
asking more pointed questions like

75
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,440
so what really was happening last week

76
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,920
at this event and we're trying to do

77
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,280
these things why are we trying to do

78
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,519
them what's the point um

79
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,480
uh

80
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,319
that's where i also recommended starting

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:48,959
to get more into the business speak with

82
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,160
tying things to like well what are we

83
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,680
trying to accomplish this quarter what

84
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,080
are the key performance indicators or

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,760
okrs

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,680
um that's that's the latest buzzword out

87
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
of the silicon valley is okrs which is

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
really just objectives you know so what

89
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,680
are things we're trying to accomplish

90
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,040
what are and how are those being

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,440
measured um and that'll give you a lot

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,360
of insight into

93
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,200
what's driving them in their own you

94
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,879
know pressures and decision-making

95
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,000
calculus

96
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:14,879
right

97
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,080
yeah and i think what you mentioned is

98
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,440
really important about the language you

99
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,280
know the buzzwords those actually mean

100
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,400
something uh you know to bosses all the

101
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
way up the chain and figuring out how to

102
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,040
translate is i think you know the crux

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,519
of what you're talking about yeah um

104
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,200
i think also asking you know and how can

105
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,400
i help

106
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,680
bosses love to know that you want to

107
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,879
help

108
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,120
so that's valuable too

109
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:37,920
um

110
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
you mentioned in one of your slides also

111
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,200
you know the kind of difference between

112
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,159
regulation and real security

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,799
and this is something i mean we were

114
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,319
walking to lunch and talking about this

115
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,200
precise thing actually so uh any

116
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
examples about uh

117
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,599
what kind of real security things tend

118
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,879
to fall through when we only focus on

119
00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,599
regulation

120
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,360
yeah so the intent of that slide was

121
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
even was even more than that i wanted to

122
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,400
start with

123
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,840
um so

124
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
i think everybody gets that compliance

125
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,560
is not real security in our field right

126
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,920
if you're in cyber security 99.6

127
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,478
understand that statement the problem is

128
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,120
then when they do that they look down on

129
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,279
the requirements they look down on the

130
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,040
need for that or that the business looks

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,360
at it that way why does my boss push me

132
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,199
about a checklist it's stupid it's not

133
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:28,560
real security

134
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,800
well the reality again going back to the

135
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:33,600
business perspective is that checklist

136
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,199
is existential

137
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,000
the business is not legally allowed to

138
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,440
operate unless that checklist is met

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,600
and so recognizing that that is where i

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,040
used it in the concept of maslow's

141
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,520
hierarchy of we have to start here

142
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
before we can do any of the other things

143
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,199
right it's like eat your veggies before

144
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,639
you're allowed to go get chocolate chip

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
cookies and in this case real security

146
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,160
is the chocolate chip cookies uh and so

147
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,919
following that through real security

148
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
then is how do i build off the checklist

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,720
concept which is exists everywhere in

150
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
some form to start to piece together

151
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,080
things that will make a difference for

152
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,919
applied security to

153
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:14,639
business needs

154
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,919
great

155
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,360
thank you

156
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,720
and i think one other thing that is uh

157
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,880
maybe not like central to your talk but

158
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,880
the people might be interested in

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
is

160
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,000
your career trajectory and how you

161
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,759
started a business

162
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,160
anything that you wanted to

163
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,400
mention about uh that's that's a big

164
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,600
leap that i know a lot of people are

165
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
curious about

166
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680
sure um in fact i have a talk on that um

167
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,320
so if you if you google my name and or

168
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:44,479
entrepreneurial adventures

169
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,880
i've given the talk at def con and a few

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,720
other places in fact

171
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
i'm giving it monday night for

172
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,240
washington state university so one of

173
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
the things i like to do is part of

174
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,319
giving back to the community is speaking

175
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,000
and

176
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,160
interacting with college students

177
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,600
so i'm happy to come and speak at

178
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
colleges answer their questions and to

179
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
me the best one is that one right what

180
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,639
does it mean to be an entrepreneur

181
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,160
because the starting point is

182
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,720
understanding how does business work

183
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,720
right cyber security is a part of

184
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,400
business it does not fit by itself and

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,479
starting your own company is inherently

186
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,680
a business

187
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,639
and so

188
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,720
in that talk i go through the different

189
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
models of businesses why that's

190
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,840
important why you should care what does

191
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,479
that mean uh and i think everybody finds

192
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,160
it interesting to actually kind of like

193
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,440
oh so that's everything that's going

194
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,120
behind the curtain on this whole place

195
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,400
that i work at

196
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,680
um

197
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
to start a business i think comes down

198
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,520
to two key characteristics

199
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,560
and

200
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
one that i think everybody assumes

201
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:41,759
intuitively is you need to be the

202
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,479
smartest or the best at something

203
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,479
look at me like the blank look is not

204
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,319
faked i am not the best of the smartest

205
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,360
at anything um what i do have and what i

206
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,520
do think an entrepreneur requires

207
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,360
is one

208
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,880
uh passion

209
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:57,759
and

210
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,360
that word gets thrown around a lot but

211
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
what it means for an entrepreneur is you

212
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,000
have to want to do this idea so badly

213
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,880
that it hurts you not to do it

214
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,240
when you're starting a consulting

215
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,840
company it's because

216
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
you need to do you want to apply those

217
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,520
services your own way when it comes to a

218
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
product the fact that that product is

219
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:17,360
not out there bothers you

220
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,800
because if you're trying to do it for

221
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,120
money uh first of all most of us don't

222
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,440
make money doing it um not the way you

223
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,120
think um i mean i'm clearly not doing

224
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,479
this from a yacht

225
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,080
um

226
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:31,520
but

227
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,199
that uh that's what's gonna get you

228
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:34,400
going through the morning because every

229
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,240
business of course goes through

230
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,840
hard times right not everything goes

231
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,680
smoothly and the thing that's gonna get

232
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,199
you out of bed on those bad days is

233
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,280
going to be that passion that it's still

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,639
you still want to make it happen and

235
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,240
you're going to go as far as possible

236
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,599
the second one

237
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,720
is tolerance for bs

238
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,120
when you run your own company

239
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,919
everything comes down on you

240
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,360
you want to learn health care insurance

241
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,000
for all 50 states i didn't want to i had

242
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
to

243
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,520
right you have to that's what is

244
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,440
required to take care of your employees

245
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:06,960
that's what's required to run a company

246
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:09,440
is all of the administrative

247
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,560
minutia

248
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,639
all of the details all the regulations

249
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,720
of things you don't care about you have

250
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,479
to you have to care about that because

251
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,160
nobody else will

252
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,479
uh so you have to be able to accept that

253
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,680
you're going to be putting up with a

254
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,680
bunch of stuff that is not core to what

255
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,280
the company's purpose is but is

256
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:26,960
absolutely just like the question

257
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,440
earlier about regulation

258
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,599
it's mandatory

259
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,958
yep

260
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,399
and it comes down to taking care of the

261
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,599
people that are going to be working for

262
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,760
you like you mentioned and getting the

263
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,958
job done that you want to do at the

264
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,679
first place yeah so branching off that i

265
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,039
just this is going to be a little bit of

266
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,200
a tangent but this is nothing to do with

267
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
my presentation everything i would like

268
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,720
to sort of follow that up to

269
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,399
giving a call out to how i think we

270
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,680
should all be approaching this in

271
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,720
industry

272
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,880
cyber security inherently is

273
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,200
an industry that brings a certain type

274
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,920
of person into it who has

275
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
either an engineering mindset has that

276
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,080
passion and curiosity that drives

277
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,320
wanting to understand and do things that

278
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,040
are typically abstract to most folks

279
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,959
and as a result

280
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,000
right so

281
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,600
we never know when something's going to

282
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,120
fail in our industry

283
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,800
this isn't like information technology

284
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,640
or traditional engineering where i can

285
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,880
engineer something to a particular

286
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,360
quality assurance

287
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,200
we are defined by a threat that is

288
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,360
continually changing and is inherently

289
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,839
unknown and so i think those those

290
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,240
attempts with that personality to to

291
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,600
want to learn everything and to be right

292
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,560
creates constant anxiety in us because

293
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
inherently we're never sure

294
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,560
there are i i joke there are no experts

295
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,560
because we're never sure there is no

296
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,640
objective measurement of security it's

297
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,720
just i think it's working because even

298
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,480
then when it's not we don't know until

299
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,399
we you know do know right attackers

300
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320
don't get found immediately

301
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
and so the call that i would put out to

302
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,120
everyone

303
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,000
is

304
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,200
kindness

305
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,560
what i mean by that is starting with

306
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,399
kindness toward yourself right to

307
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,160
reducing that anxiety to looking at

308
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,959
work-life balance to recognizing you

309
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,120
can't solve all of this you can't be the

310
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
individual hero to overcome a system

311
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,079
which is a business like i talk about in

312
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,640
my talk where they don't care about

313
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
security or where you are in a place

314
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,760
that does but you're under resourced or

315
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
you're trying too hard or you're all of

316
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,040
these things um so be kind to yourself

317
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,399
take care of yourself because you can't

318
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,560
take care of anything else without that

319
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,640
and then the corollary to that is treat

320
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,320
everyone with that same kindness because

321
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,839
they're going through the exact same

322
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,959
thing that you're going through

323
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,240
those are both really true awesome

324
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,760
well thank you so much i really

325
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,959
appreciate you spending your time with

326
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,040
us at cactus con hopefully we'll see you

327
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
in person next year uh if anybody has

328
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,040
any additional questions you can feel

329
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
free to pop them in the q a and discord

330

take care
