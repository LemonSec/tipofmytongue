1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:06,720
all right

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,720
hey everybody

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:12,000
gonna get started in just a minute

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:13,599
by a minute i mean like more like 10

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:16,560
seconds

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,800
all right so

7
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,720
good to see everybody again i guess

8
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,279
welcome to the after times uh you know

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,960
this is the first conference that i've

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,560
been back to since the beginning of the

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,720
covid19 pandemic and it feels really

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,800
good to be back

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,000
uh so let's talk about

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,399
2021 this year uh aka 2020 part two

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,360
uh

16
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,680
2020 was a little bit sparse on stories

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,920
it seemed like 2021 everybody got their

18
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,600
energy level back and was able to like

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,079
cover uh a lot of cyber stuff and

20
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
sometimes not in the greatest way

21
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:51,840
uh yeah and at this point i guess mark

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,520
zuckerberg is sort of a recurring like

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,120
mascot in these these kind of roasts

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,800
all right so who are we for any of you

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
that have not seen this talk before uh

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,319
yell you introduce yourself yeah so hi

27
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,159
everybody this is part three this is our

28
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,119
third talk um and i am yael

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,520
i'm a journalist and i i guess probably

30
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,080
half of my work is distilling really

31
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,560
complicated technical stuff that to make

32
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,200
it accessible to normal people ideally

33
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,600
without losing any nuance

34
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,360
um and the other half is investigative

35
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,799
reporting and i started doing these

36
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
talks because i'm sort of terrified

37
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,560
about having a big journalism fail

38
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,640
so i thought i would just kind of try to

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,320
learn from other people's mistakes

40
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,880
and i'm david huerta i'm digital

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,479
security trainer over at freedom of the

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
press foundation

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,040
and i help journalists learn about how

44
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,960
the internet works and how technology

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,720
works and how it could be used to spy on

46
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
them and to help them have it not spy on

47
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,079
them

48
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,000
i also sometimes write

49
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,159
it's something i do on the side so i've

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,520
written for a few publications here and

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,320
there

52
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,880
and uh dropped out of asu in 2010 to

53
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
co-found heatsink which is a hackerspace

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,200
right here in mesa it's down the street

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
you should go check it out at some point

56
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,639
all right so welcome all good to see you

57
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,080
all in person good to see you all in

58
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,360
cyberspace

59
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,120
uh here's what we got on the grill of

60
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,440
course slathered with sweet baby rays

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,879
okay so today we are only looking at

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,400
news articles even though there are a

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
lot of really terrible up ends so many

64
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,760
yes

65
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,840
there's a lot of marketing materials

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,599
published by brands that are kind of

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,440
potentially misleading

68
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,319
and a lot of broadcast news and audio

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
that we don't like but you know we only

70
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,519
have an hour so we're going to stick to

71
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,480
just news articles

72
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
all right so just some gentle reminders

73
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,760
uh

74
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
bad article doesn't mean the author is

75
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,360
bad every time a bad author doesn't mean

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,760
the publication never is bad every time

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,959
bad publication doesn't mean the

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,440
industry is bad every time uh

79
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,760
we actually like journalists uh and we

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,040
kind of understand it's like hey you

81
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,560
know even your favorite restaurant will

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,080
give you a tummy ache every now and then

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,120
so just something to keep in mind uh and

84
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
we in many cases uh source all these

85
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,879
stories from our own media diets like

86
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,720
you'll see like we're not specifically

87
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,480
calling now any specific publication

88
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
because it's holistically bad so much as

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,599
just like it happened to be on the radar

90
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,920
because we like reading them generally

91
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,519
or you know go out of our way to read

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:20,480
them

93
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
uh sometimes hate read them but that's

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
another story

95
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
we'd like to focus on ways that both

96
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,959
journalists and hackers can do better as

97
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,239
kind of the tldr of this

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,480
and this year we have themes uh yeah you

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,560
have some some details on this yeah so

100
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,640
we uh we we had we actually spent a

101
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,080
whole year looking at stories that we

102
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,159
thought might be bad and uh

103
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,440
there were so many of them that we kind

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,879
of divided them into uh different themes

105
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,640
and the first theme is try reading the

106
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,480
privacy policy in terms of service

107
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,920
and that doesn't mean that everything

108
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,519
that we picked out would have been

109
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,680
better if people had done that but we do

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,519
see it as a best practice like you have

111
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,799
to read the fine print you have to

112
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,400
compare the fine print use diff check

113
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,120
sometimes to kind of figure figure those

114
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,599
things out

115
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
and i'm a little nervous about this

116
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,879
because this is one of my favorite

117
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:11,439
journalists for one of my favorite sites

118
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,319
um

119
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,760
and i don't actually think that this was

120
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,680
his fault which i'll go into later but

121
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,079
um there was an article in our technica

122
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,238
about whatsapp giving users an ultimatum

123
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,839
that they had to share data with

124
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:25,440
facebook or stop using the app

125
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,199
and this is the reason the article was

126
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,600
written is because whatsapp uh had this

127
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,759
pop-up saying like oh

128
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,840
agree to these new changes but they

129
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
weren't actually new changes

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,080
um they there was actually no change in

131
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,600
how they shared and provided data with

132
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,800
facebook

133
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,240
and

134
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,759
this was a practice that had been in

135
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,160
place since 2016. i think there was some

136
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,919
tiny changes to how you interact with

137
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:49,919
businesses using facebook and whatsapp

138
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:50,960
but

139
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:53,440
um this one i see this as a messaging

140
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,759
fail on whatsapp's fault because users

141
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,360
thought they had an opt-out option that

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
hadn't existed for many years

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,320
there was one story that got it right

144
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
and that was another favorite writer for

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
another favorite site

146
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,160
and it was a lily hey newman who's

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,120
awesome

148
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,120
but one thing i did notice is that her

149
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:13,600
story came out a few days afterwards

150
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,600
so i think part of the issue is that

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
there's sites like arts technica and the

152
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,800
verge where they make people write a

153
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,400
story a day

154
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,160
which i can't even imagine writing that

155
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,919
often and sometimes it takes a couple

156
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,680
days to figure out what's going on

157
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,680
so the actual data sharing i see is a

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,199
fail and i'm going to kind of put a line

159
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,720
in the sand and say that if you are a

160
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,759
company

161
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,759
and you're not comfortable saying what

162
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,600
you actually do and who you share data

163
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,560
with and you should not be sharing it

164
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,320
and they also didn't go on the record

165
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,919
and that's another line in the sand if

166
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,080
you are a pr person or coms or if you

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,680
are a company

168
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,520
you should be able to describe your

169
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,680
policy and your changes clearly to the

170
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,479
media

171
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,680
and there's been a little bit of a

172
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,759
movement with the verge and some other

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,600
sites saying we don't want to talk to pr

174
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
people off the record we want to be able

175
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,199
to quote you

176
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,080
and so sometimes going on background can

177
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,600
be really helpful for a journalist but i

178
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,360
can also see why people don't want to do

179
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,360
that because sometimes comes people lie

180
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,039
to journalists so your article ends up

181
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,120
being wrong because you were lied to by

182
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,440
somebody that you cannot quote

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,759
because it was on background so

184
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,280
and then the other issue i see is that

185
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,440
wire like there was whatsapp wrote a

186
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,880
statement to kind of clarify some

187
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,560
information and so

188
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
wired which doesn't publish as often as

189
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,360
arts technica had um the time to kind of

190
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
process it and look at the terms of

191
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,120
service and that information and i think

192
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,400
that that's why

193
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,880
um it did better to their credit rs

194
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,199
technica did publish uh like a short

195
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
update on the bottom with some on

196
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,720
background information that helped

197
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,800
clarify a little more but i see it as

198
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,960
kind of a fail in the industry where

199
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
like there's a big change and people are

200
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,759
writing different things about it you

201
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,120
don't really know what's going on until

202
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,639
a few days later and i don't think this

203
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,400
is just a journalism fail i think it's

204
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,000
like the whole ecosystem

205
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:01,599
so this next story is from i think

206
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,880
fastpost

207
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,960
which happens to have a very very

208
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,639
similar logo to foreign policy which

209
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,319
always throws me off

210
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
uh so this article has a very spicy

211
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,680
headline audacity is now possible

212
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,560
spyware and remove it asap

213
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
so

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,400
there's a few uh issues that we kind of

215
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
found with this uh one is that in this

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,000
case

217
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,160
there's definitions to spyware there's

218
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,080
definitions that vary a little bit but

219
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,800
largely are like harmonized between av

220
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,319
vendors in the in that industry

221
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:33,599
holistically

222
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,360
uh and there's certain things that you

223
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,240
know that is categorized by and in this

224
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,240
case what audacity was doing with its

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,759
kind of

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,960
telemetrics collection and you know the

227
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,639
fact that it has to connect to a server

228
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,479
and thus reveal an ip address to receive

229
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,599
updates

230
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,319
uh would barely in our opinion basically

231
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,240
in my opinion anyway barely warrant is a

232
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,960
potentially unwanted program or a pup

233
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,000
uh audacities analytics collection in

234
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,840
this case uh

235
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,120
yeah it's pretty normal for most

236
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,840
i guess commercial slash like normie

237
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,919
software like yes you wouldn't expect

238
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,520
like the linux kernel to have like

239
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,520
google analytics in it for some reason

240
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
but like in this case with you know if

241
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,160
you use a lot of software it will

242
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,000
include that kind of uh

243
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,400
that kind of thing entailing it

244
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,680
uh so

245
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,800
yeah and this is pretty common like

246
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,120
adobe suite would do as much as audacity

247
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,080
is doing now so would windows by default

248
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,000
and uh so there was another kind of

249
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,599
article that talked a little bit about

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,958
this with a little bit more nuance in

251
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,880
terms of just saying like no this isn't

252
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,719
actually spyware like it's just adding

253
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,839
some new metrics for things

254
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,200
and so this is

255
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
a problem on a few different

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,240
levels uh in this case from the company

257
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,240
side uh which was the company that

258
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,680
bought audacity it's still open source

259
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:52,399
but

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,800
it's uh you know owned by i forget what

261
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,560
the actual name of it was called

262
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,480
and most of these kind of policies tend

263
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,440
to be

264
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,880
heavily influenced by lawyers you know

265
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,000
they want to cover their ground as much

266
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,680
as they can to remove the possibility

267
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
they might get sued for something

268
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
uh and in this case um a lot of the a

269
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,720
lot of open source users have different

270
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,000
expectations regarding a different

271
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,920
culture regarding privacy

272
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,560
uh which is probably good and but in

273
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
this case you know they wouldn't be

274
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,279
exactly the kind of crowd that would

275
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,320
call windows and adobe sweet spyware so

276
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,839
so there is a little bit of nuance there

277
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,880
it's like almost like well you're

278
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,399
speaking to a specific audience and this

279
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,399
makes sense to that audience i guess

280
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,640
uh and this is similar to or at least an

281
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,120
echo to 2012 when ubuntu started

282
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,360
including amazon.com searches in their

283
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,640
like application search bar

284
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,920
okay so our favorite app clubhouse

285
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,360
okay that was a joke

286
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,600
um

287
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:49,760
there was an article on bbc about

288
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:52,399
clubhouse

289
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:54,959
knocked offline in china

290
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,720
but it said that clubhouse didn't record

291
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,880
conversations but we know that clubhouse

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,440
does record conversations and it also

293
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,640
shares the audio if it has to for legal

294
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,160
legally

295
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,760
but it does delete the conversations

296
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,200
after the session has ended if there

297
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,519
weren't any complaints

298
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,959
and people like really freaked out about

299
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,279
this on twitter and i'm like did bbc not

300
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:16,800
read the terms of service because if

301
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
they had read it they would clearly see

302
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:20,640
that audio is recorded but not

303
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,079
kept

304
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,440
and then people like went on twitter

305
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,040
they were really upset and they were

306
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
like this says it doesn't record what it

307
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,000
does

308
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:28,959
and

309
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,320
having been in the position where

310
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,760
somebody's saying there's an error and

311
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,040
i'm trying to figure out was there

312
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,800
actually an error or not the people on

313
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,480
twitter who were like ranting and raving

314
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,079
about it did not say oh yeah but it's

315
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,680
also deleted if there wasn't a complaint

316
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,720
and the

317
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,959
story wasn't updated until a week later

318
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,560
which i see as a fail because i think

319
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,600
you should make

320
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
like changes as quickly as you can but i

321
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,240
also think that people freaking out and

322
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,000
not sharing all the details makes it a

323
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,839
lot harder for journalists to go back

324
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,519
and be like was there an error wasn't

325
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:58,720
there

326
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,200
um so

327
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,959
that was that one and then our next this

328
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,800
leads us to our next theme which is um

329
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,800
don't just believe the press release do

330
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,800
actual research because sometimes

331
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,880
companies believe it or not will send

332
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,120
out press releases that kind of have

333
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
statistics that have the potential of

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,120
being misleading um or maybe

335
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
are wrong

336
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,600
and so like a lot of errors that i see

337
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,839
not just this year but every year is

338
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
that people just kind of

339
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,560
flat out republish a press release and

340
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,320
that's bad journalism so you should

341
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,600
actually do research instead

342
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
so the first example we have for this

343
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
a story about

344
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,880
quantum computing and

345
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
in this case it's founding a weakness

346
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,480
and in perilous encryption from the

347
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
swiss company

348
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,680
um

349
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,600
so there's a lot this is a specific

350
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
genre it's it's pretty common to see for

351
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,279
um a lot of the kind of like whatsapp is

352
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,200
hacked type stories but now we're seeing

353
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,959
it with other things as well

354
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,320
uh this is an example with quantum

355
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,200
computing uh and in this case this is

356
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,200
one of those kind of big if true stories

357
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,079
and you know maybe the thing to look at

358
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,560
is to see whether or not it is true

359
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,839
uh

360
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
so there's already that the idea of like

361
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,320
quantum computing breaking encryption

362
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,160
algorithms uh elliptical curve and base

363
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,160
encryption like prime factoring based

364
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,560
encryption is not exactly news like nist

365
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,200
is already working on stuff for that

366
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,240
uh

367
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,399
but you kind of see like the gaps in the

368
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,000
story it's like hey

369
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,160
you know we quoted we quoted an expert

370
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,160
they said like it's a big if true but i

371
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,399
need to see details on the research

372
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,279
yes uh i am james jonah jameson i want

373
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,519
to see pictures of spider-man slash like

374
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,639
scientific research on this breakthrough

375
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,800
uh and when you and like from a

376
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,639
reporting side of things like if if you

377
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:53,839
have something that seems like a big

378
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,519
claim like the the kind of mental

379
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,600
exercise that i would recommend is like

380
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,040
pretend that the person that you're

381
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,399
talking to the pr person is like

382
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,560
a rando on a message board that is

383
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,200
saying that you will revolutionize the

384
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
you know electrical industry by saying

385
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,040
you have free energy from like crystals

386
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,279
or whatever just like start thinking

387
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,720
skeptically

388
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,680
um

389
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,200
and yeah again knowing the background of

390
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,360
just like has is this really like is

391
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,120
this actually news in terms of just like

392
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,120
the idea that cryptography might be

393
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,200
broken based on what quantum computers

394
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,240
can do

395
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,760
and there are some stories there are

396
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,120
some like developments that are worth

397
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,440
keeping track of in that space uh the

398
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,200
ieee spectrum which i don't actually

399
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,800
have quoted here but has

400
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,480
some articles around the idea of

401
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,839
scalable error checking which has been a

402
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,120
challenge with quantum computing is

403
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,639
something that is being worked on

404
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,880
but that also right now isn't a thing

405
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,040
because that also requires like more

406
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,120
computational energy more qubits to make

407
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,720
that work

408
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,639
so if that were to be like saul that'd

409
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,120
be a pretty substantial big deal claim

410
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,519
and if you have big deal claims

411
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,920
to bring in our boy carl sagan

412
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,079
extraordinary claims require

413
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,720
extraordinary evidence

414
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
billions and billions of bad stories

415
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,600
there you go

416
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,800
okay yes the security researchers

417
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:11,680
contacted didn't say plc gtfo which is a

418
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,880
really good book i have all three of

419
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,240
them even though i don't understand most

420
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,480
of it

421
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,880
okay so this is a topic near and dear to

422
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
my heart this is a story in our local

423
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:23,279
paper about chandler exploring mobile

424
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,519
voting with a company called votes

425
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,199
could that help address election

426
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,959
skepticism

427
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,959
and this article i don't know if you

428
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,720
guys know the story but there were some

429
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,800
mit researchers that found some really

430
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,360
serious flaws in votes

431
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,800
it was really good credible research

432
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,680
that votes discounted and then they

433
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,440
helped to pay to commission audit by

434
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
trail of bits which is a really

435
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,519
well-regarded security firm and they

436
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,040
found the exact same issues that these

437
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,839
researchers did and yet votes keeps kind

438
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
of i think it's probably borderline

439
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,760
slandering these researchers they just

440
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,519
keep going around being like oh

441
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:01,519
this study was rigged they were using an

442
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:02,880
old version to the point where these

443
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,040
researchers have an faq page that kind

444
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,120
of debunks all of those

445
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,040
so flash forward to chandler exploring

446
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
this app

447
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,880
in this article they they quoted from

448
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
votes's website that pushed back on mit

449
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,800
research and they kind of did both so

450
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,399
it's like oh they quoted the research

451
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:20,720
and then they quoted the response to it

452
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,600
um

453
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,399
and

454
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,000
of course they didn't mention like oh

455
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
yeah but by the way this was all backed

456
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:27,440
up by a different firm probably because

457
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,759
they didn't know

458
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,360
so i feel like votes's claims weren't

459
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,519
rigorously fact-checked

460
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:36,079
i they did contact a vote spokesperson

461
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,440
but they didn't reach out to the

462
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,920
researchers for comment so i think even

463
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,920
if you are quoting from two different

464
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
documents like if there are allegations

465
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,759
you should absolutely have to call that

466
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,759
person and i don't know for sure but i

467
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,440
imagine the research would be would be

468
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,440
like oh yeah we have an faq page and

469
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,040
also this was backed up by an

470
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,360
independent audit

471
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,480
i feel like there was a little bit of

472
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,639
both sides of them but i also

473
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,639
these are local beat reporters so

474
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:03,040
they're not like like knee-deep in votes

475
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,120
drama in the hacking space as i am they

476
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,959
don't know that votes went to the

477
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,920
supreme court to argue in favor of the

478
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,839
computer fraud abuse act like and so

479
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,839
that's stuff that i kind of know so

480
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:15,920
like i wrote insider knowledge is hard

481
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,320
though and i've been like kind of dming

482
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,079
people links as they write these stories

483
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,519
being like oh by the way here's some

484
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,680
more background that you don't know

485
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,199
and you might think i'm really smart or

486
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,120
you might think i'm completely nuts but

487
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,800
but like check out these links here

488
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
all right and this next um story comes

489
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,399
from the guardian in this case it's

490
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
about you know what passwords are

491
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,959
terrible we should rethink this and i'll

492
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
be honest like the first time i read the

493
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,759
story or at least like three quarters

494
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,199
away through i'm like this is fine i

495
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,399
don't understand this is a very

496
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,720
relatable protagonist lost bitcoin

497
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,279
because of a hard drive crash r.i.p

498
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
and uh you know things passwords should

499
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,279
should go away i'm like yes i agree and

500
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,040
then it's like wait wait wait wait wait

501
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,720
wait wait what's going on and it starts

502
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
going into this like weird kind of

503
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,280
direction about biometrics and complete

504
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,079
total surveillance of your movements

505
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,439
um

506
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:10,240
so

507
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,880
in this case biometrics are not magic

508
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,400
and that's you know something that i

509
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,319
think this audience would be

510
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,240
pretty well familiar with in terms of

511
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,119
seeing

512
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,199
demos on how to throw face id with

513
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,199
printouts or how to throw fingerprint

514
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:25,520
readers with gummy bears for example

515
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,520
um or in case if you haven't seen ticket

516
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,280
brands sorority amateurs unfitbits that

517
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,799
was like an interesting art installation

518
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:31,600
that

519
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
uh faked fitbit data based with like

520
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
metronomes and power drills and like

521
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,000
bike wheels and stuff like that

522
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,440
uh which was being like the thing that

523
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,000
was collected by insurance companies

524
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,120
so

525
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
there's also this kind of whole like

526
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,280
trail of this company that's like

527
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,000
founded by a former like

528
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,880
israeli intelligence like person and

529
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,760
being like hey we can track all we can

530
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,600
identify people completely based on

531
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,440
things like their

532
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
the way they move things how often like

533
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
their gates which is like the way they

534
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,720
walk

535
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,480
and uh

536
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,919
you know a lot of these other things i'm

537
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
like this is are you sure this is the

538
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,679
thing you want instead of just using one

539
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:12,840
password

540
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,440
uh this is so that's like a little bit

541
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
of an issue there and it seems to have

542
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,600
kind of a largely uncritical approach to

543
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,640
it because it's like literally

544
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,640
describing sort of the world buildings

545
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
like a corey doctor novel like it's

546
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
literally like the gate tracking and uh

547
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,919
little brother it's like hey what if we

548
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:29,840
use that to identify you online so you

549
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,520
can never anonymously whistleblow ever

550
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,120
again i'm like

551
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,679
maybe we should talk about that part

552
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,080
um and honestly like i think like it

553
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
started getting into it's like there's

554
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,520
password managers you can use that

555
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,360
but people don't want to get i'm like no

556
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,360
no go back to that go back to that part

557
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,760
tell us about password managers

558
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,440
um says david where to every single

559
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,600
sentence all the time

560
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,120
all right next theme

561
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:55,679
okay so this is a one that i think a lot

562
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,120
of journalists get wrong and part of it

563
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,480
is because we have tight deadlines and

564
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,320
it's like oh no i need to get somebody

565
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,760
to quote on this thing i'm going to call

566
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,360
everybody i know

567
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,640
but you if you are writing a story that

568
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,760
about a specific subsection or of tech

569
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,160
you need to make sure your expert has

570
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
expertise in that domain because

571
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,679
otherwise they're going to say dumb

572
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:17,039
things and you're going to publish them

573
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,960
and look down and like the

574
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,480
public is going to it's just bad so

575
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
sometimes you might say i need some

576
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,600
extra time on this because i haven't

577
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,440
gotten the right person to bounce this

578
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,480
off of

579
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,760
so and i think part of the problem too

580
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,200
is that a lot of hackers won't talk to

581
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,320
journalists because journalists are evil

582
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,760
but basically they're like journalists

583
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,039
get stuff wrong so we're not going to

584
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,760
talk to them but there's you know room

585
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,919
for people to maybe get stuff right if

586
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,840
you do talk to them

587
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
um so that's kind of my opinion on that

588
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,799
yeah it's either they talk to you or

589
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
they talk to like the votes guy so

590
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,960
you know

591
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
something to think about

592
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,440
so

593
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,720
uh

594
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,880
all right so for anybody that remembers

595
00:19:58,880 --> 00:19:59,760
this

596
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,400
choice classic from 2018 the bloomberg

597
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,559
story about you know

598
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
chips from china the size of a grain of

599
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,600
rice bean and better didn't see

600
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,039
motherboards

601
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:11,200
uh they didn't retract that they doubled

602
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,960
down on that a little bit more and they

603
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,559
kind of dug their heels in and say like

604
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:18,080
we got more in terms of that story

605
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,200
and uh so this is a sequel to that

606
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:22,960
long hack how china exploited us tech

607
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,240
supplier

608
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,080
and this is

609
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,520
you know kind of

610
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
talks a little bit like in the original

611
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:30,720
story too i thought like there were

612
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,039
hints at what is probably an interesting

613
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,480
cool story

614
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
uh with more facts and more evidence but

615
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,840
this is kind of a little bit of that too

616
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:41,280
but you kind of see the contours of what

617
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,280
could be a story about implants being

618
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,159
used

619
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,120
um

620
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,280
in the same way that like the nso and

621
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,320
nsa well i put nso nsa tao

622
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,400
uh team does as we know from the like

623
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,960
snowden hacks or sorry from the snowden

624
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:57,200
um documents

625
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,640
and

626
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
it seemed like there is a possibility of

627
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,600
that but then it seemed like they talked

628
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,679
to a lot of people that were

629
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,600
a little bit away from the tech and

630
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,200
maybe were filling in the gaps of their

631
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,960
knowledge with what they imagined to be

632
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,640
the case which is why you end up with

633
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,080
kind of these weird and consistent

634
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,400
stories behind like you know

635
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,080
this mentions like oh yes there's chips

636
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,120
that are embedded in the grain of rice

637
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
it looks like a transistor and other

638
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,000
people saying like oh it's the bios ship

639
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,120
actually

640
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,320
um

641
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,679
and there's a few

642
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:24,799
uh

643
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,240
you know things that they cite as

644
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,320
evidence but don't show so in this case

645
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,679
there's like hey we confirmed this in

646
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,360
corporate documents i'm like

647
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
cool can i can i see them why can i have

648
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:35,039
those that'd be cool

649
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,159
uh there's also um

650
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,840
some audits that were referred to but

651
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,000
again those are not really included or

652
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,000
not there's not really much detail on

653
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,440
that

654
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,799
so

655
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,440
in this case there was a specific kind

656
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,520
of assumption that was made based on the

657
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,880
idea it's like hey

658
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,360
we found a malicious code in these

659
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,640
specifics micro these specific bios

660
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,159
chips basically

661
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,480
uh within different super micro servers

662
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,720
and because they were from different

663
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,400
machines at different times

664
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,640
thus they must have been applied at the

665
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,240
factory which if anybody has ever

666
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,400
installed openwrt on the router

667
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,880
you know that you don't have to like

668
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,520
have the same firmware on the device

669
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,120
that was shipped to you you can change

670
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,799
it to something else

671
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,480
so this is i think an important detail

672
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,080
that was kind of missed

673
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
because i could see like the real story

674
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,080
being that like actually this

675
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
server is being like intercepted mid

676
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,159
shipments in place in somewhere in the

677
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,760
supply chain and that you know there is

678
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,280
a specific targeted

679
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,600
bios chip that has set a biostrip

680
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,039
centers being flashed knowing who the

681
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,600
end like client is going to be

682
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,039
um and i would like to see them

683
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,799
investigate more into that direction but

684
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,320
unfortunately that's not really where

685
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:47,679
they went

686
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:50,000
uh they basically just kind of doubled

687
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,080
down and being like well we we cited all

688
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,240
these like you know top government

689
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,919
officials who maybe don't exactly know

690
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,159
how computers work

691
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,520
uh and there was a little bit of that

692
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,799
from pulling all the things kind of

693
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,120
discussing some of the uh kind of

694
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,640
connecting the dots of just like hey

695
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
maybe the person that they're sourcing

696
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,559
is not necessarily uh

697
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,840
kind of tech savvy enough to know the

698
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,280
specifics of how this is actually being

699
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,480
pulled off if it's happening

700
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,960
yeah so this is the thing it's like i do

701
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
like um my my gut feeling in my heart of

702
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,480
hearts is that there's probably some

703
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,000
kind of there has been some sort of

704
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,320
implant story that has happened at some

705
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,039
point that is ready to be told

706
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,159
um

707
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:32,960
but in this case uh isn't or at least

708
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,200
kind of like not going in that specific

709
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,480
direction

710
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,000
so

711
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,240
i would like if if available like the

712
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,679
thing that i would love to see is like

713
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,760
well if we have

714
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,919
infected bios chips like let's let's

715
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:47,840
take a look at them let's decap them

716
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,760
let's have the expert

717
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,360
actually look into one of these ships

718
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:52,960
and see what they find and then publish

719
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,559
that

720
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,760
all right

721
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:56,480
okay

722
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,320
this was a weird one

723
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,559
this was china appears to warrant india

724
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,159
pushed too hard and the lights could go

725
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,960
out there was a power outage and it

726
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
looked like a warning

727
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,320
um and i don't this is one of the ones

728
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,000
that i'm like did this happen or not

729
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
happen um and i talked to people who

730
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,600
were kind of experts in the region and

731
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,720
they were like

732
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,559
no there wasn't any real indication that

733
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,679
this was a signal um

734
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,679
and so maybe it was and i'm wrong but i

735
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,360
don't know like once the dust settled

736
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,360
the local papers said oh yeah this was

737
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,360
due to human error not a cyber attack so

738
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,880
maybe it was a cyber attack and they

739
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
were

740
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,960
coerced into changing their story but i

741
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,760
think it probably wasn't

742
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,760
and this was writing based on a report

743
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,520
and the report itself said the link is

744
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,120
unsubstantiated and i was kind of

745
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,640
surprised because new york times has a

746
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,240
bit of a reputation

747
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,039
of

748
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,120
taking people's stories

749
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:49,039
and not giving them attribution because

750
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,799
they will reinterview everybody to make

751
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,559
sure the story got it right and they

752
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:54,799
didn't do that here they did link to a

753
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:55,760
report

754
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,919
um and it was updated seven months later

755
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,279
so i'm not really sure because the first

756
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:01,360
time i was like maybe they had to wait

757
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
for the dust to settle to get the story

758
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
right but it was updated and people

759
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,159
are still saying it's wrong so

760
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:09,679
i don't know it's a little bit of a

761
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,080
weird one like when you're citing from a

762
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,760
long report

763
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,080
maybe try to verify that better or

764
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,480
something

765
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
and yeah and the next uh the next thing

766
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,120
that we are our advice our best practice

767
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,960
is to make sure you're really clear on

768
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,000
the details

769
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360
um and this was a story in the record

770
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
israeli government raids nso group

771
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,640
office

772
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,559
but did they raid them because they said

773
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,240
they visited them and the visit was

774
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,320
pre-planned you don't usually pre-plan a

775
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,000
raid

776
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,520
is it twitch raid a twitch

777
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
the word raid was used over and over

778
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
again in the story but an nsl spokesman

779
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
used the word visited so i'm like was it

780
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,200
a raid was it an inspection was it a

781
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,440
document audit was it a formal meeting

782
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,840
who knows

783
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
and i think like somebody on twitter

784
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,440
said oh i used the word raid but it was

785
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,880
a mistranslation

786
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,120
or an earlier report got it wrong and

787
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
they just changed it so i think that

788
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,559
that's a possibility or it could just be

789
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,559
sensationalism

790
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,640
and i hate to be a lot of times people

791
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
will say like oh this is clickbait and

792
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,960
most stories don't most people do not

793
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,559
get paid by the click anymore it's

794
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,559
usually based on subscriptions

795
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:21,360
and

796
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
you want to build believe it or not

797
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,600
journalists and news organizations do

798
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,279
want to build credibility so they don't

799
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,720
want to have something wrong like they

800
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,000
don't want to have clickbait and get

801
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,600
called out on it that's not a good way

802
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,919
to build trust

803
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,080
so i don't want to accuse this is all of

804
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,760
our what went wrong are just pure

805
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,320
speculation but um but it is a

806
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,400
possibility that like the word rage is

807
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,279
sexier so

808
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,760
cool uh this next story chelsea manning

809
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,200
is back and hacking again only this time

810
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,520
for bitcoin based privacy startup

811
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,960
so a little bit on this story is like we

812
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,880
we have at least one of these every year

813
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,960
where somebody misinterprets how like

814
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,159
tor works

815
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:04,799
and uh this time it's kind of a dumb

816
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,039
whammy it's also misinterpreting how

817
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,279
tour works but then also not totally

818
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,400
having a full understanding how

819
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,720
blockchain works which i mean who can

820
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:13,919
blame them

821
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:15,200
so

822
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
in this case there's a few things that

823
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,120
are cited here that talk a little bit

824
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:22,480
about a few which is possibly respiring

825
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,679
referring to some specific tour hacks

826
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,120
that don't actually have so much to do

827
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,679
with the tor network so much as

828
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:32,399
uh ways of reaching either dark net

829
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,279
sites or hacking the tor browser via

830
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,520
firefox exploits so for any of you

831
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:38,880
familiar with the silk road takedown

832
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,240
there was

833
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,200
an fbi report about how they i think

834
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,559
there was a wired article about this

835
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,480
about how they basically looked at an

836
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,240
issue with the cms login to reveal what

837
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,720
the actual ip address of the server was

838
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,279
and the same thing goes with um

839
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,440
a few other kind of like

840
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,520
uh sites that were taken down at darknet

841
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,399
sites by the fbi using firefox exploits

842
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,640
in this case with you know back in 2014

843
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,520
it was kind of a thing with firefox

844
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,399
um there's also some mention of a 2020

845
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:11,120
bitcoin attack with tor nodes but these

846
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,640
have to do with malicious exit nodes

847
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:17,039
doing ssl stripping so

848
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,880
it's not so much the tor protocol and

849
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,600
toward data so much as it is just like

850
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:26,559
any intermediary being a bad actor

851
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,320
and in this case

852
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,200
uh

853
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,960
the kind of comparison is made it's like

854
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,880
oh tor has all these problems ranging

855
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,039
from its funding to its

856
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:37,919
um to its security issues and

857
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:39,760
it's not exactly a fair comparison

858
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,240
especially since nim isn't real yet it's

859
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,799
a white paper

860
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:46,960
so it's not exactly onions to onions

861
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,640
comparison as it were

862
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
and it's uh still something that would

863
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:53,279
probably need some kind of front end

864
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:54,640
would probably need some sort of network

865
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,880
infrastructure and thus the same or

866
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,840
similar attacks would also apply to nem

867
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,559
which is an issue it cites the use of

868
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:03,840
mixnets

869
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,600
as does the white paper to some degree

870
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,960
and the white paper goes into some more

871
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,480
detail unfortunately there's not really

872
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,240
much article there's not much in the

873
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,679
article mentioning it's like why are

874
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:13,679
mixed next mixnets good this time

875
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,880
because this is something that people

876
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
have tried in the 90s for anonymizing

877
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,799
email for example that ended up just

878
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
being like a wasteland of like spam

879
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:21,600
relays

880
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,559
um

881
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:24,080
and it'd be nice to see like hey

882
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,080
remember that idea that we had and why

883
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,520
it was really bad in the 90s this time

884
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
it's different but maybe ask maybe ask

885
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,840
here's like why why is it different this

886
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,679
time

887
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:35,279
uh so yeah and that's the thing it's

888
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:36,799
like i think there's a lot of

889
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:38,640
interesting kind of complexities in the

890
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,880
tor network um so it's really easy to

891
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,640
make mistakes reporting on it

892
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:43,760
unfortunately

893
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,760
um but it is useful to like do google

894
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
search on like what these things that

895
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,520
are being referred to actually are

896
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,640
uh

897
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,679
and then of course like knowing how

898
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,200
blockchains work like what can they do

899
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
when can they not do uh you know what

900
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,279
are their purpose and like what their

901
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:59,279
kind of like what is their ideal

902
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,279
settings um because something like nim

903
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,360
for example does cannot replace tor

904
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,880
because of the fact that

905
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:08,000
uh tor is an anonymity network nem kind

906
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,080
of requires you to

907
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,320
essentially like pay for your route to

908
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,480
anonymize yourself over to connect the

909
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,840
server so it's really more like a

910
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,080
replacement for tor onion services like

911
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,440
you wouldn't be able to connect to

912
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,720
anonymously connect to the new york

913
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,559
times over nim as it exists on the white

914
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,880
paper unless new york times were to like

915
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:26,399
basically go out of their way and set up

916
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
all this blockchain stuff and every

917
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,320
single one of their users had a like nam

918
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
wallet address

919
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,120
um it's kind of like one of those things

920
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,080
it's like the practicality of

921
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,840
cryptocurrency is if everybody can

922
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:37,440
accept cryptocurrency and i can walk

923
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
down main street in mesa without anybody

924
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,640
being able to stop bitcoin so is that

925
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
really a practical answer is that really

926
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,799
a comparison maybe not

927
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,320
so

928
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,919
that being said also like i love chelsea

929
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,840
but like when you look for experts on

930
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,120
things like there's a lot of

931
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,360
specialization that happens in a lot of

932
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,320
our field

933
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,320
um so talking to somebody that is kind

934
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,840
of has like a

935
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,840
broad knowledge of things

936
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:01,760
is good but then maybe also follow up by

937
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,840
talking to somebody with a more deep and

938
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,120
specialized knowledge and things like

939
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,360
blockchain

940
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,919
well this is my favorite one

941
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,519
public oh no yeah i know we're calling

942
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:12,880
out for republica another one of my

943
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,240
favorite sites

944
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,919
but this was a story about how facebook

945
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,919
undermined privacy protections for its

946
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,640
two billion whatsapp users

947
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,840
and uh

948
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,360
it had some really good information so

949
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,880
that was what was so frustrating about

950
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,320
this story is that it could have been a

951
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,320
really good story because it had a lot

952
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,559
of great information on pen registers

953
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,039
and trap and trace devices

954
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,480
so some of the reason why you might want

955
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,480
to use signal over whatsapp

956
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,559
if you are worried about government

957
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:41,360
about targeted government surveillance

958
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:42,960
and also the challenges of moderation

959
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,440
and scale but it also kind of said like

960
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,679
oh you know what's up it's breaking

961
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,840
privacy because if i send an abusive

962
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,919
message to somebody and they report it

963
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:54,240
it's no longer end and encrypted like

964
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,399
that was kind of the implication and i'm

965
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,320
like no that's not abuse report

966
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,159
mechanisms are not a backdoor if you

967
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:01,600
send me a message and i show it to

968
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,039
somebody else that does not have

969
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,320
anything to do with whether it was

970
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:05,600
encrypted

971
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:06,799
and they eventually issued a

972
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,320
clarification after like many cycles of

973
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,919
the reporter getting defensive and

974
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,279
telling people they were wrong on

975
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,480
twitter

976
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,559
so to me i feel like there's two areas

977
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,240
like ideally your story would be right

978
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:19,840
in the first place but your second

979
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,480
chance is if everybody if a lot of

980
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:24,080
experts are pointing out that something

981
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,919
is wrong maybe like take a breath and

982
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,600
listen to them

983
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,960
and they did eventually issue a

984
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
clarification but the headline remain

985
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
and it gets even worse not only are we

986
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
calling out propublica but we're calling

987
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,559
out rs technica again because ours

988
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:38,640
should know better like the

989
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,960
writer of this story is a tech he is a

990
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,679
tech expert and uh he's like oh what's

991
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,360
up and then encrypted messages aren't

992
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,600
that private after all because if you

993
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:50,080
report an abuse mechanism then

994
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,880
like uh they can see that if i get a

995
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,720
message and i report it as abuse then a

996
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,279
moderator will see it oh like and it's

997
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,360
like it was very disappointing that

998
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,919
arsenica did this copycat story

999
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:02,880
um

1000
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,039
and again the writer like there i think

1001
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,720
ars technica has some of the smartest

1002
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,200
commenters in the industry and and again

1003
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,799
he was doubling down

1004
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:13,279
um and not kind of taking what they said

1005
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,760
it at face value and that was weird

1006
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,440
uh and i think part of the issue here is

1007
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,200
that people really don't like facebook

1008
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,039
it's better now it was facebook when i

1009
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:23,360
wrote that but uh people don't like meta

1010
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:24,880
and so therefore they don't trust what's

1011
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,600
up um and i think people are

1012
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
you have to kind of watch your biases

1013
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,200
just because you don't like a company or

1014
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,000
they've done bad things or there's

1015
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,480
lots of room for criticism because of

1016
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
real things doesn't mean you have to

1017
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,399
kind of watch that you're not

1018
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,279
implying bad or seeing bad things when

1019
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:44,559
they're not there because i'm glad

1020
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:46,720
there's report mechanism abuse report

1021
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,279
mechanisms and i want to say there was

1022
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:50,799
maybe a lack of understanding of what

1023
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,880
end end encryption is which i think is

1024
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
definitely true for profublica i'm

1025
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,640
hesitant to say that for ours because

1026
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:59,200
they really should know they've they're

1027
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,279
really good at covering this

1028
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,720
so i don't know maybe it was just all

1029
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:06,000
the what's that paint

1030
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,200
and then we're going to talk about what

1031
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,639
we can do better

1032
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,520
uh because again like we we kind of drew

1033
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,800
you in by being like oh we're going to

1034
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,399
talk about the worst stories but

1035
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,599
throughout this talk you probably

1036
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:16,639
realize it's

1037
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,480
an ecosystem issue and it's not really

1038
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:20,480
just like these damn journalists getting

1039
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,560
things wrong like there's just a whole

1040
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,159
industry thing and it's there's stuff

1041
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,639
that journalists and hackers and these

1042
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,839
companies can do better

1043
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,359
oh yeah do's and don'ts for journalists

1044
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,719
and i and i don't think that this will

1045
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,879
fix every one of these issues but i do

1046
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:39,520
think it'll help um yes you have to read

1047
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:41,199
the documentation you have to diff check

1048
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,320
the documentation if you don't

1049
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:43,918
understand the changes you have to run

1050
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,000
it by somebody who does

1051
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,480
if you are going to call people out you

1052
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,399
have to give them a chance to respond

1053
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:52,639
it's not just like oh these researchers

1054
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,239
said this company did something bad but

1055
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,320
the company said they're lying like you

1056
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,800
have to actually talk to the people

1057
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,280
when you get a claim from a company from

1058
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,520
pr and spokesperson you have to try to

1059
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:04,960
fact check it on your own because

1060
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,079
sometimes they will leave out

1061
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,520
information

1062
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:09,119
or give you inaccurate information

1063
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,720
sometimes they don't even know like a

1064
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,320
lot of companies

1065
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,720
that are really technical the coms

1066
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,079
people aren't getting paid enough to

1067
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,320
understand how blockchain works

1068
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,480
so sometimes you have to fact check it

1069
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:22,400
and it's not there's nothing there's no

1070
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,240
malice involved

1071
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,920
if you're reporting on speculation i

1072
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,839
would just say tread really carefully

1073
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,520
there um

1074
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,520
and this is the thing for editors

1075
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,960
because a lot of times people will blame

1076
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,400
writers for headlines and usually

1077
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,960
editors write or rewrite the headlines

1078
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,320
and a writer is not going to tell you

1079
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,440
that because they're not going to throw

1080
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,520
their editor under the bus publicly but

1081
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,960
if a headline does not match the

1082
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,880
reporting like i feel like editors

1083
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,040
should really run the headlines by the

1084
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,320
journalists

1085
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,680
first

1086
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
sometimes they do like ap split testing

1087
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,359
and they see what pulls the most traffic

1088
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,520
but like i think you should really

1089
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,359
make sure it's accurate because it's

1090
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:59,040
that journalist's credibility on the

1091
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
line and if you want people to trust you

1092
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,200
and talk to you and read your reporting

1093
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:05,040
and take it seriously like you can't

1094
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:08,800
have headlines that are incorrect

1095
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,680
and of course we also have some do's and

1096
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:14,079
don'ts for security researchers uh if

1097
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:15,599
you are complaining about a piece

1098
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,200
publicly um you know go into detail on

1099
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,760
the why of why that is um you know and

1100
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:27,440
uh include some nuance in that criticism

1101
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,320
so

1102
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,599
also if you're going to speak as an

1103
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:31,359
expert on a particular subject it's

1104
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,040
important to actually be a

1105
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,320
expert on that particular subject

1106
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,839
having an opinion is not the same thing

1107
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:40,720
as having facts

1108
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,560
and then comms teams and i probably

1109
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,760
sound a little critical of comps but

1110
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,280
there are some really excellent comms

1111
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,680
people the ones that i like like will

1112
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,160
not tell a lie and i kind of learn who

1113
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,079
they are and try to ask for them or cc

1114
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,320
them when i'm talking to other ecommerce

1115
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:55,200
people

1116
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:56,880
but this is also true for companies you

1117
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,400
have to build trust with the public and

1118
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,079
it's through what you do not how you

1119
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:03,040
spin things because it does come out

1120
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,520
if you are doing data sharing like be

1121
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,839
open and transparent like i feel like

1122
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,000
there's this weird kind of facade where

1123
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,280
people are like oh yeah we have a

1124
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:13,440
privacy page and we explain some things

1125
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,200
but people don't really understand

1126
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,520
what's going on

1127
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,880
and then the last one is that i think

1128
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,640
it's okay to go on the record like a lot

1129
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,640
of these companies are so risk-averse

1130
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:24,960
that they they're like oh yeah i'm a

1131
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,280
pr person and i will tell you what this

1132
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,280
does but only secretly and don't quote

1133
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:30,480
me on it

1134
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,800
and like sometimes there's a lot lost in

1135
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,320
that translation

1136
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:37,040
so i think it's good to actually go on

1137
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,040
the record when possible and just you

1138
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,119
know be willing to put be willing to put

1139
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:42,880
your name and and that information

1140
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,800
behind it and uh one thing i heard

1141
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,079
recently in a it was at um a trapped uh

1142
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,440
conference there was a comments person

1143
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,680
who was saying like if the company ceo

1144
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,119
is not willing to put their name on

1145
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,320
something then i'm definitely not going

1146
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,320
to put my name on it and i think that's

1147
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,839
the kind of pushback you have to give

1148
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:58,720
people

1149
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:01,359
internally

1150
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,240
cool so we're gonna go ahead and open

1151
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,880
the florida questions um

1152
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,280
we have uh these

1153
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,560
like apparently throwable microphones

1154
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:15,760
um so if if you're okay with me throwing

1155
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:18,079
this like squishy microphone at you feel

1156
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:19,200
free to raise your hand and i'll go

1157
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,759
ahead and do that

1158
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,760
or we could just if you if you don't

1159
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,880
want to have something thrown at you we

1160
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,680
can just repeat your question

1161
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,000
i can also just like hold the microphone

1162
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,240
oh yeah

1163
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:43,760
oh

1164
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,800
all right

1165
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
excellent

1166
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,280
do you have to do anything

1167
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,160
um

1168
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,680
speak and do it okay perfect oh okay

1169
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,520
cool um

1170
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,760
since you are uh some scribes what do

1171
00:38:57,760 --> 00:38:59,599
you think in the last few years how have

1172
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:02,000
i'm curious how uh public records laws

1173
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:03,599
have been statewide here anyway and then

1174
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,760
also federally have they gotten worse do

1175
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:07,359
you see journalists using them in a

1176
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:08,720
better way

1177
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,520
sorry using what uh sorry foia and then

1178
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,640
state public records laws oh foia

1179
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,799
yeah

1180
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,960
yeah yeah

1181
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,599
um okay yeah so i think i think in

1182
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,320
general it is really hard foils are

1183
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,680
really difficult it's really difficult

1184
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,599
to get information that you want using

1185
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,920
foia and public records requests

1186
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,599
i don't know if it's gotten worse or

1187
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:33,359
better it's kind of hard to tell overall

1188
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:34,640
because there's so many different

1189
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,800
agencies that you can foia

1190
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,640
but i haven't heard anybody say like oh

1191
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,400
this is easy to do now

1192
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,400
there is a really cool nonprofit called

1193
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:44,079
the gumshoe group that will hook you up

1194
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:46,560
with an attorney um sometimes you have

1195
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,320
to like apply and they help me get a

1196
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,640
bunch of data from the phoenix police

1197
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,640
department actually um that they were

1198
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,240
not going to give me until a lawyer

1199
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,880
drafted a letter and like kind of made

1200
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,280
motions that you would need to do like

1201
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,880
towards

1202
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,720
a lawsuit but um but yeah there's a lot

1203
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:04,480
of cool people i like one of the best

1204
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,319
things i've done is like hook up with uh

1205
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:08,720
mukrak and like other journalists jason

1206
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,040
leopold has helped me a lot just like

1207
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,480
what do you do when they won't give you

1208
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,319
this data like what do i say next and

1209
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:17,040
how do i get it and so like it's an

1210
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,000
annoying time-consuming thing but um but

1211
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
yeah it's cool that we have a community

1212
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,599
of people willing to help each other on

1213
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:25,040
it but yeah i don't know if it's gotten

1214
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,640
worse or better i have seen some good

1215
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:29,040
journalism based on it

1216
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,119
so that's really cool that's good to see

1217
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,960
so yeah it's one of those things that

1218
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,599
should work better than it does

1219
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,880
it also takes a long time um and it

1220
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,640
always sometimes leads to like awkward

1221
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,960
situations like why did we just get a

1222
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,720
letter from the cia and it's like oh

1223
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,640
yeah so-and-so was an intern like a year

1224
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,720
ago made a foia request

1225
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:50,880
and then it's just like ah okay our

1226
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,319
co-working space people are like a

1227
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,160
little bit like raising an eyebrow on

1228
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,920
that but that's fine

1229
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,160
yeah i had i got um a couple of foils

1230
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,440
recently where they're like you filed

1231
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,040
this request three years ago do you

1232
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
still want it let us know within a week

1233
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,720
or we will remove it forever and i'm

1234
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,480
like oh my god like

1235
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,839
why would you think that just because

1236
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,440
you took forever that i don't want this

1237
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,920
anymore and one time i missed a deadline

1238
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
and i had to refile which was really

1239
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,520
annoying because they were like oh you

1240
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
didn't respond immediately so therefore

1241
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,839
we decided we didn't want or they were

1242
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:21,280
trying to get me to

1243
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:22,800
what they'll do sometimes if you ask for

1244
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,240
a lot of data is they'll try to get you

1245
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,760
to narrow it down

1246
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,000
um which is fine you know it'll help

1247
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
them get it to you quicker and if you

1248
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,880
only need a smaller amount of data then

1249
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,800
that's great but like i didn't want it

1250
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,079
narrowed down but the the choices were

1251
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,319
do you want it narrowed down

1252
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:42,079
or do you want us not to do anything

1253
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,760
and i'm like no and because i didn't

1254
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,920
respond within a week i had to refile it

1255
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,160
it's annoying

1256
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,079
cool

1257
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:53,040
any other questions

1258
00:41:58,240 --> 00:41:59,920
oh yeah yeah you can you can toss that

1259
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,240
over if you want

1260
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,480
all right uh so with the recent jonathan

1261
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,200
scott and beijing misinformation

1262
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,880
campaign do you think that there should

1263
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:09,680
be

1264
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:12,000
a vetting process for journalists

1265
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,160
wanting to reach out to any security

1266
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,079
researcher wanting to just talk to press

1267
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:18,880
and vice versa

1268
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,119
uh okay yeah so this is a story that was

1269
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,640
in wired business and i want to point

1270
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,560
out that it was in the business section

1271
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:27,440
usually when i i've noticed that when

1272
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,800
there are stories that seem a little

1273
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,480
often wired they're not in the security

1274
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:32,000
section even if they are security

1275
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,680
stories and that's happened a bunch of

1276
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,880
times

1277
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,440
but yeah i absolutely think if somebody

1278
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
wants to interview you for a story you

1279
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,960
should vet that person you should

1280
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,119
look at their clips

1281
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:45,119
you should look at you can look at their

1282
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,960
tweets their website whatever like you

1283
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,880
shouldn't talk to i i do this too when

1284
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:50,319
journalists want to interview me i make

1285
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:51,760
sure that like i don't want to say

1286
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,800
anything

1287
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,640
that i don't want to say anything in an

1288
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,160
article that ends up being wrong because

1289
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,839
it makes me look bad

1290
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,280
so yeah i think there should be a

1291
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,760
vetting process um

1292
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:03,520
but it's i don't know if people always

1293
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,319
know exactly what to look for

1294
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:09,200
um and yeah i i didn't really

1295
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,960
read that story very closely yet but it

1296
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,720
is on our list of candidates for next

1297
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,760
year

1298
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,200
but i know there was like a lot of

1299
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,440
people that were pushing back on it

1300
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,599
pretty aggressively on twitter and i was

1301
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:21,760
like oh yeah this story is probably

1302
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,200
sketchy but i haven't looked at it

1303
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,880
closely myself but i will say that

1304
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,520
sometimes people don't like journalists

1305
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:29,359
and like are mean to them on twitter

1306
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:31,680
because they're good at their jobs

1307
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,040
so if you're like oh i don't want to

1308
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,480
talk to those journalists because people

1309
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:35,760
are yelling at them that's not always

1310
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,920
accurate and it happens that it's more

1311
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,599
often women journalists where people are

1312
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:40,720
like oh yeah i really don't like those

1313
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,720
journalists blah blah blah and like

1314
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,640
sometimes when you kind of you know peel

1315
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:46,160
the layers of the onions so to speak

1316
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,920
it's like they wrote an investigative

1317
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,240
story that made a company mad or they

1318
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,000
made a hacker mad because they told the

1319
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,520
truth about them or whatever and so

1320
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,359
yeah it's just things to look at when

1321
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,359
you're sketching that out another thing

1322
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,800
you can do if you're a little nervous

1323
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:02,960
about talking to people

1324
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:05,200
on the record is you can

1325
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:07,359
say ask them to email you questions and

1326
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:08,960
some people will let you do that and

1327
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:10,720
then you can like have your responses

1328
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,119
sent back to them so then you're less

1329
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:15,599
likely to be misquoted it doesn't allow

1330
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:16,880
them to have it's not as good for the

1331
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,160
journalists because they can't ask

1332
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
follow-up questions and like get good

1333
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,640
conversation going but like sometimes

1334
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,240
that's what you got to do

1335
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,520
and then another thing you can do that

1336
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
some people will let you do is to review

1337
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,280
your own quotes and not everybody's

1338
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:30,640
allowed to do this but you can ask them

1339
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,000
like if you're planning on using any

1340
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,560
quotes can i review them and the context

1341
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:36,640
they're in or whatever um

1342
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:38,000
almost nobody will let you see the

1343
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,680
article in advance a lot of people ask

1344
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,760
for that and like almost nobody will do

1345
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,680
that because it's kind of a conflict of

1346
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:45,280
interest and weird things can happen

1347
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,200
when people try to preempt a story or

1348
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,480
just

1349
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:49,920
i don't know there's

1350
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:51,920
most people will not let you do that but

1351
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:53,839
and if you're really lucky it's a site

1352
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:55,599
that has fact checker so they will call

1353
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,440
you and verify your quotes and ask you a

1354
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,359
few questions so but yeah definitely you

1355
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:04,040
should do vetting of anybody you talk to

1356
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:07,599
cool any other questions

1357
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:13,520
all right oh yeah

1358
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:15,759
okay

1359
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,920
um

1360
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,280
yeah you can take i have a follow-up

1361
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:27,280
video okay uh okay so the question was

1362
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,200
what new trends are we afraid will be on

1363
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,720
the docket next year and i think it's

1364
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,280
gonna be blockchain

1365
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,720
yeah i was going to say i think it's

1366
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,599
going to be blockchain and nfts like

1367
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,520
um but yeah there's i think there's

1368
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,960
probably going to still be more like

1369
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,160
this breaks encryption like um and i

1370
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,200
feel like people have a lot of

1371
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,400
difficulty with understanding how

1372
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,480
encryption works and one thing that

1373
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,720
bothers me personally is um some of

1374
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,359
these bills and laws that are constantly

1375
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:55,040
being tried like the earn it act where

1376
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,880
people are like um we need to break

1377
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:58,800
encryption to protect children which is

1378
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,720
actually a more nuanced

1379
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,480
conversation than they would make it

1380
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:04,720
seem and like um so yeah i think that

1381
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,920
that'll probably be beyond there too uh

1382
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,400
yeah those are that's fine i guess

1383
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,839
yeah no i mean that's literally what i

1384
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:14,560
was going to say is i think that we're

1385
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,520
seeing the growth of like overly complex

1386
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,920
like web3 ecosystems and reporting that

1387
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,520
is going to be intrinsically difficult

1388
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,040
because even the developers that are

1389
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,319
working on that don't necessarily know

1390
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:25,440
how it works

1391
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,280
so you know that's going to lead to some

1392
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,319
confusion unfortunately

1393
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,680
oh yeah what what's

1394
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,960
uh it's coming in pretty low actually

1395
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:39,599
oh cool if you make a for if if you make

1396
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,000
a foia request leave the company and it

1397
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,240
goes through do you lose the ability to

1398
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,079
get that information

1399
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:46,960
um

1400
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,640
it still goes to the address that you

1401
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,480
had it delivered to and then i awkwardly

1402
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,319
pick up a letter from the cia from the

1403
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:54,160
like front desk i'm like what's going on

1404
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,119
guys

1405
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:56,480
um that's what happens or at least

1406
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:57,680
that's what happened the one time a

1407
00:46:57,680 --> 00:46:59,119
colleague of mine did that and then i

1408
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:01,040
was just like i'm confused you can

1409
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
actually call the office and talk to a

1410
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,720
person and some of the people processing

1411
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,240
these requests are

1412
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,079
good and will work with you and are not

1413
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,000
trying to sideline you they're just kind

1414
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,119
of overworked

1415
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,160
um but i usually do it over email well i

1416
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,520
do a lot through muckrock which you do

1417
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:17,040
have to pay for after a certain amount

1418
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,800
of requests but it's just it's easier

1419
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
for me to have it all in one space i'm

1420
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,200
not filing crazy amounts but um i try to

1421
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:24,880
get them to email email me things

1422
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,400
instead of mailing them because i wanted

1423
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:28,000
an electronic form it just makes it

1424
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:29,680
easier to search and

1425
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,400
i'm gonna have to scan it anyway um

1426
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,280
so

1427
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,960
but yeah i guess you could try to give

1428
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,880
them a new address but i usually give

1429
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,480
them my email anyway

1430
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:40,800
um so and hope that they'll process it

1431
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:43,520
electronically

1432
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,880
cool any more any other oh yeah one here

1433
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:52,839
there you go

1434
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,559
how do you go about

1435
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,440
determining what kind of foia

1436
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,920
request like

1437
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,760
when you

1438
00:48:01,760 --> 00:48:05,280
you realize hey there's a story

1439
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,480
i just need to get foia requests in to

1440
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:09,599
back it up

1441
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:11,839
how do you go about that um you have an

1442
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:13,839
answer okay so how do you how do you go

1443
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,079
about deciding what to foia um there's a

1444
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:17,200
really good book called the art of

1445
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,359
access by david cullens

1446
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:21,040
but i don't know like for me sometimes

1447
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,319
i'll see something that looks

1448
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:25,680
interesting like i'll be like oh um

1449
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:28,160
there was a talk about in cells at the

1450
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:29,760
air force or something i should fly to

1451
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,119
that to see if they have any documents

1452
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:32,800
surrounding that

1453
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,880
or sometimes i'll look for complaints

1454
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:37,359
like if cc or ftc complaints um around

1455
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:38,400
something

1456
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:40,559
or um and try to get more information on

1457
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:41,680
that

1458
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:42,559
um

1459
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,000
i don't know i've waited for like black

1460
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,520
lives matter stuff around phoenix

1461
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,040
because i'm like i want to see what the

1462
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:49,040
internal communication is and of course

1463
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,440
that was like i had to narrow it by year

1464
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,160
and and keywords and stuff like that but

1465
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,680
yeah you can kind of foil anything it's

1466
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,079
really fun um there's muckrack has like

1467
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,520
a lot of different

1468
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,599
samples and i've done that too like i

1469
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:02,720
looked at what people foyed in

1470
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:04,559
california and was like oh foia that's

1471
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:06,640
for arizona so for me i was doing a lot

1472
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:08,319
of police surveillance like i wanted to

1473
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:09,119
see

1474
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,280
how are automated license plate readers

1475
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:12,880
being used in arizona and all these

1476
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,400
different police jurisdictions and i'm

1477
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,960
going to foil all of them and compare it

1478
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:18,640
and it took forever but i did write an

1479
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,760
article about that as a freelancer

1480
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,119
but yeah it kind of depends on what

1481
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:24,400
you're looking for

1482
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:25,680
but yeah there's some really good books

1483
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:27,200
out there there's foia so you can kind

1484
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,319
of copycat or get ideas off of and then

1485
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:31,839
there's also

1486
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:33,599
books out there that show you like what

1487
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:35,680
what actually produces a document

1488
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,440
because that's the actual documents that

1489
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,800
you're going to be trying to get and you

1490
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,040
can kind of try to figure that out for

1491
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,480
your story

1492
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,000
and we have five more minutes so we have

1493
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,079
time for maybe like two or three more

1494
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:48,960
questions yeah

1495
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:57,119
i will pontificate about foia a little

1496
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,559
bit more the cool thing about foia is

1497
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:00,000
that if you have documents you don't

1498
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,559
necessarily need a source

1499
00:50:02,559 --> 00:50:04,000
you can have a source comment on the

1500
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:06,319
documents but you have like actual

1501
00:50:06,319 --> 00:50:08,640
evidence of something in a file which is

1502
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,559
really valuable as a journalist instead

1503
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:13,839
of just people speculating

1504
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,680
