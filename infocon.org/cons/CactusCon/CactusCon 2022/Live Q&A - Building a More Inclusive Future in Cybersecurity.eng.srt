00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,840
they're doing a scavenger hunt to talk

58
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,680
to all the different uh the different

59
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,560
folks here um michelle let me ask you

60
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,360
from um like for the from the hirers

61
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,840
perspective you know um we've talked

62
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,239
about how to break into the industry and

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,160
how to get a job

64
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,840
for someone who's in charge of a team or

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,160
who's looking to hire do you have advice

66
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
for people about how to

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,920
how to reach out and get a diverse

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,879
selection of candidates to to talk to

69
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,160
how how can people best make that effort

70
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,360
i think

71
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,239
um

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,800
fortunately and unfortunately it's up to

73
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,360
you um i think you cannot leave it to

74
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,879
your company to do it all because

75
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,879
everybody is so busy

76
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,959
so i do two things and my recommendation

77
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,599
is to try and at least do two parts so

78
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
one is

79
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,040
partner with other associations like in

80
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,200
this case i've approached uh

81
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,160
associations like dieses or other uh

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,560
cyber security organizations like cyber

83
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,319
security groups for women

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,120
uh that are starting their career uh

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,440
always try to do something on your end

86
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,360
and then put pressure in your company

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,519
and tell them like here is my

88
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:10,800
uh

89
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,720
my goal for diversity for the year and i

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,280
need you guys to help me support that

91
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,519
and don't be afraid to to raise that

92
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:21,440
hand um

93
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
it can be scary sometimes i know that i

94
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,239
go through it every day but uh it's

95
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,040
important to to do it and

96
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,400
it's the only way that you can make

97
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
change

98
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
yep that's absolutely true

99
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,440
um do you have any thoughts about the

100
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
the particular labor market that we're

101
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,000
in right now i know that

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,319
it is always difficult to fill these

103
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,840
positions but even more so right now

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,840
people are reevaluating what they want

105
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,599
out of a job they're rethinking what

106
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,760
they want to do as far as remote versus

107
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,920
in-person work and

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
you know it's

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,879
that means that there's a lot of

110
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,720
opportunities for people that are

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,799
looking to get hired but we're still

112
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,799
seeing uh we're still seeing rules go

113
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,560
unfilled so that means there are some

114
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,480
disconnects between the folks that are

115
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,840
trying to hire

116
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
and the people that are looking for jobs

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,680
you have any thoughts on that

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,478
yeah so i think definitely i have seen

119
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,120
that i have seen it uh i've benefited

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,280
from it i think i've seen a huge

121
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,880
increase in teachers trying to switch

122
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,919
careers

123
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,919
and i've actually hired a few and

124
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,919
they're phenomenal csms like they're so

125
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,320
understanding oriented that the way they

126
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,400
can adapt their skills to speaking to

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:39,040
customers has been incredible

128
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,880
so there's a lot more people out there

129
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,240
with different skills that might be a

130
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,160
great asset to your team

131
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:46,639
i think the one con that i've seen is

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
that a lot of people

133
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,360
don't know what type of resumes they

134
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,759
need to get through the door and again

135
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,479
going back to those keywords that

136
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,000
little bit of

137
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,919
tuning of the resume so i think that

138
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,160
that's where i have seen we miss out on

139
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,759
a few candidates and that's why i always

140
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,600
try to have a conversation with them

141
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
before and like if i think

142
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,240
they would be a good match to make sure

143
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,720
that uh we keep them

144
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,880
open to adding those changes so they can

145
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,639
have better opportunities again across

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,639
the board not just with us

147
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:21,759
um and lastly like i i really really try

148
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
to make sure that everybody's looking to

149
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,080
change out there meaning there's more

150
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,240
people out there so try to open that

151
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,320
circle i get so many internal

152
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,639
recommendations like the daughter of so

153
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,880
and so sisa wants to come join and like

154
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,720
or the the daughter of so and so and

155
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,240
like they're all great and i want to

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,360
give them all opportunity but that's 80

157
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,440
that's the reason why 80 of the jobs

158
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,600
don't even get posted

159
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
so i want to make sure that i have a

160
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
conscious effort to say okay if i'm

161
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,520
gonna take two internal referrals the

162
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,680
next three jobs that i hire

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,240
even if it takes me longer i will push

164
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,319
myself to interview

165
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,280
to speak to at least one person that

166
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,720
wasn't

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,520
a fully cyber recent background sorry uh

168
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,639
cybersecurity background

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,319
yeah

170
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,000
now and sometimes you don't know what

171
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,199
you're going to get until you talk to

172
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
somebody so thinking about people with

173
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,400
different backgrounds and how they might

174
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,479
be able to apply to what you're actually

175
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,560
trying to accomplish you know get into a

176
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,800
conversation and you you know so we've

177
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,039
been trying to be more open with who we

178
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:27,199
interview and just having more of those

179
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,039
conversations that could lead to you

180
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,960
know maybe not this job but maybe

181
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,880
something over here exactly and like

182
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
that's something that i like to do like

183
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,240
i keep post-its of like

184
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,240
even if i'm like super aware of the key

185
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,680
traits that i want to consider in

186
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,520
someone like i keep it posted at all

187
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,080
times like next to my screen so i can

188
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,680
remember that i'm looking for traits

189
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,840
because we all have this unconscious

190
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
bias that might help like

191
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,919
immediately bond with someone or not

192
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,400
bond with someone and totally throw

193
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,759
something off and like

194
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,599
no one's even conscious that we're doing

195
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
it right so that's why i like to keep

196
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
myself honest and again

197
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,479
look for traits be open to

198
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,800
to having extra conversations in which

199
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,319
you can guide them but seeing that

200
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,880
potential after all and again i've had

201
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,840
incredible luck uh in in giving people

202
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,080
those opportunities

203
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,960
