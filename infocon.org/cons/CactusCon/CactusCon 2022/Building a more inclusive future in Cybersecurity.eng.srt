5
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,920
of changing the face of cyber security

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,720
my name is michelle winters i was born

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,840
past year i have been working as a

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
customer success manager

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,080
for a leading cyber security company

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,279

toddler i'm a wife a sister a daughter

00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,920
and overall i'm a professional

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,680
multitasker

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,000
i have been fortunate enough to work in

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,640
the iit industry for over a decade

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,879
and having transitioned into management

19
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,360
i feel responsible for influencing other

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,760
leaders to be more flexible when hiring

21
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,600
new team members to join their team

22
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
it is no secret

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,280
that there is room for growth when it

24
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,920
comes to diversity and equality in i.t

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,039
and in cyber security

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,680
according to osaka

27
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,600
and to the asaka journal minorities

28
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,960
comprise 26 of cyber security and only

29
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,840
21 of the overall workforce

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,520
men abnormal women three to one surprise

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
however our industry has thousands of

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,400
roles waiting to be filled and there is

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,720
a constant hesitation to hire anything

34
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,520
but what we consider the ideal candidate

35
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,600
well the reality is that we're setting

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,720
our our own teams back

37
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,880
i hope my story helps

38
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,720
everyone feel more comfortable opening

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,960
the door to potential not non-standard

40
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,439
cyber security team members

41
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:44,159
and as cliche as it sounds

42
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,320
i accumulate in the united states trying

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,479
to achieve the american dream

44
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,399
i graduated from the university of texas

45
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,840
san antonio around 2005 with a degree in

46
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:55,759
communications

47
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:57,759
living in san antonio back in the early

48
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,399
2000s we continuously heard

49
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,000
that rackspace was the best place to

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,960
work

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,439
the caveat was that you had to be very

52
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,439
technical you had to have a computer

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:09,598
science degree which i did not have at

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
the time

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
i did however have determination drive

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,840
empathy like no other and i just had to

57
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,280
find my way

58
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,480
uh

59
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,599
into an interview and to be able to show

60
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,200
and prove my value

61
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,680
so after many interviews i was given a

62
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,640
break and finally the little break i

63
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,040
needed came in the way of mr brian

64
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,319
carter

65
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,959
my soon-to-be manager he saw a potential

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,920
in me that others had just glanced over

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,680
he believed in giving opportunities to

68
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,920
people that had the right attitude

69
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,239
he told me during the interview

70
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,760
that he could teach the tech but he

71
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,720
could not teach attitude so he coached

72
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,560
me as well as many others through the

73
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,640
interview process and amongst many

74
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
things he said be able to explain how

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
email works how the internet works

76
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,640
and that was a game changer for me

77
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,200
the biggest takeaway here is that

78
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,680
instead of following the norm and

79
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,680
hiring conventional candidates brian

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
focused on the traits he had identified

81
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
as bringing success to people in it

82
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,440
roles

83
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,000
and as a result unbeknownst to him he

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
began to change many people's lives

85
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,400
including mine

86
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,480
and honestly this is how i got my foot

87
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
into the it world

88
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,640
after that i went ahead and i started at

89
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,519
the bottom of the totem pole

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,040
i was a fur a frontline engineer i was

91
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,120
fixing emails on their blackberries on

92
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,519
customers blackberries so if you can

93
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,760
remember those for like iphones are now

94
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,519
but especially for business everybody

95
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,200
needed a blackberry

96
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,920
i had never been a tech support person

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,560
but within a few months i was

98
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,400
so much better i could set up outlook

99
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,720
and listen six minutes with my eyes

100
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:55,760
closed

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,080
i was always

102
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,480
i have always been a great communicator

103
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,560
and i've always had a very optimistic

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,680
drive

105
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,920
my desire to learn more and my overall

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
determination to succeed was what helped

107
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,239
me gain an excellent reputation across

108
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:11,519
teams

109
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,560
and before i could count to 10 i became

110
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,639
a real engineer working in one of the

111
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,880
most fantastic startups

112
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,959
and from the emo team i was able to move

113
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,880
to the linux support team

114
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,360
and i still had zero technical

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,080
certifications

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,479
like brian gave me my first shot i was

117
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:32,639
able to get many more opportunities

118
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,720
along my career path

119
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,120
phenomenal people like craig denton jyn

120
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,800
the thulier

121
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
abidari

122
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,199
all

123
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,360
are some of the visionaries that looked

124
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,440
at the right traits for roles versus

125
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,280
technical qualifiers

126
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
they each gave me a shot to make it and

127
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,440
boy did i run with it

128
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,960
what came next was that all of a sudden

129
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,800
despite being the hardest worker the

130
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
most positive determined people kept

131
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,440
just passing me

132
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
so i literally started playing a game

133
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,759
called the most outrageous promotion

134
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,520
challenge from

135
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,680
22 year olds just graduated from private

136
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,199
universities coming to be sales vps to

137
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,199
associate employees getting paid more

138
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
than i was just because of their gender

139
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,000
i really learned pretty fast that

140
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,320
as much as i love this country it's not

141
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,320
a meritocracy

142
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,240
but i really kept at it

143
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,520
and then

144
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,720
a young ceo at the time 26 you heard me

145
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,000
right 26

146
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
came into the company i was working for

147
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,919
and within no time he dissolved it

148
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:42,160
he also laid us off the assume

149
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,320
and i had to put in

150
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,520
a pin to the two years i had spent being

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,039
the best of that job

152
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:51,600
here i was thinking my promotion was at

153
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,400
hand

154
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,759
and out of nowhere boom gone the odds

155
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,840
are stacked against me again i'm the

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
underdog

157
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,680
i honestly remember frantically looking

158
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,440
for a job panicking trying to get

159
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,759
whatever half decent job i could find

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
it was a very stressful time if you've

161
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,840
never been through it it's just super

162
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,759
stressful

163
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,919
and in that moment of despair

164
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,160
i just sat on a piece of knee and i just

165
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,240
remembered to leverage the network i've

166
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,960
been building particularly at rec space

167
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,280
and i reached back to brian carter he

168
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:25,120
had been my mentor so

169
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,280
i pinged him and he gave me the best

170
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,080
advice she literally told me michelle

171
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,720
ballers don't get desperate and i was

172
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,479
just so happy that he thought i was a

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
baller i did not think anyone else saw

174
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,880
me that way especially after all that

175
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:40,080
rejection

176
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,240
but he helped me find the confidence i

177
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,919
had lost and i didn't even know i had

178
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,318
within me

179
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,440
finally

180
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,160
the right opportunity aligned and came

181
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
about and i met jane and i would need a

182
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,440
talk entirely dedicated to her but i'm

183
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,039
going to keep it short

184
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
she's just a phenomenal woman

185
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,120
and i can tell you that at the time she

186
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,599
had a team that was 95 women and her

187
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,440
vision of customer success aligned

188
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,960
exactly with

189
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
my vision

190
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,919
i wanted to work with her more than i

191
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,919
wanted an easy bake oven and that's like

192
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,160
a lot when you're eight years old in the

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
80s 90s

194
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,039
um

195
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,400
so i was super excited to work for her

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,120
and coincidentally i had my my final

197
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,880
interview with another company that had

198
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,560
flown me to boston

199
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,400
so i took that as a shot and i asked

200
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,840
gene to meet me

201
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,520
i told her i'm in town i really want to

202
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,599
meet you and i met with her and

203
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,720
by the time i left i had a job offer a

204
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
job offer from her and i was so excited

205
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,280
i felt like it was like a massive win

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
for the underdog team um

207
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,680
so i was just thrilled

208
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:50,720
and

209
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,759
i started my role i was super happy and

210
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,479
three months into my kick-ass new csm

211
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,080
job in cyber security being like a

212
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,720
little fatty um i found out that i was

213
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,080
pregnant

214
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,879
yes

215
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,240
this is something that i had always

216
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
wanted like my entire life

217
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,120
but i did not expect it to be so soon

218
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,280
and as a female in it i was so so scared

219
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,440
that now i had to take maternity leave i

220
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,919
was super naive i was worried that the

221
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,599
news would make

222
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
my career

223
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
be on hold that i would be benched

224
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,520
so

225
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
i just

226
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:30,639
asked gene to to talk

227
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,440
and she looked worried and i had to be

228
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
really brave and i just blurted out the

229
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,360
words i'm pregnant and i don't want to

230
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,640
disappoint you

231
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
i think i even cried

232
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,200
um i had always been a career woman so

233
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:45,040
having covered for many women while they

234
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,320
went on leave

235
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:49,519
i understood what it implied for a teen

236
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:50,640
so

237
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,040
i kind of braced myself for impact and i

238
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,600
was like hoping for the worst but to my

239
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
surprise jean was incredible so

240
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,360
supportive

241
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,080
my company cyber reason was incredible

242
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,560
and they supported me in such a way that

243
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,560
i honestly cannot wait to pay it forward

244
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
when it comes to one of my team members

245
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,120
to become a parent

246
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,920
i

247
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,240
i was so inspired by their response that

248
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:16,240
honestly i just turned all my attention

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,800
into delivering value and as much of it

250
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
before i had to go on leave

251
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,399
so i went ahead and i closed all my

252
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,480
renewals early that year i even had

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,279
upsells i put together a plan

254
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,320
to

255
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,240
uh all the people that would cover for

256
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,560
me on how things from the status of all

257
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,320
my accounts anything that needed to be

258
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,880
pending escalation paths

259
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,440
and once

260
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,959
it was my time to go and leave i was

261
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:43,120
able to do a full

262
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,839
a full and very efficient transition

263
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
and it just made me and my team feel as

264
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,320
easy as possible about the entire

265
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:51,839
situation

266
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,880
once my son was born jean even came to

267
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,480
see me she happened to be in town and

268
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,320
she stopped by the hospital

269
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,600
and also

270
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,079
my friend juliette came over and she

271
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
followed in jean's footsteps and

272
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,560
eventually juliette became my manager

273
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,800
and i just loved the support that they

274
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,560
showed and

275
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,279
the overall way that they continue to

276
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:15,120
support my career

277
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,399
and

278
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
once i became a mother one of the things

279
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,160
that i

280
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
was mostly shocked about was that my

281
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,200
career wasn't benched at all

282
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,040
it was completely opposite it made me so

283
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,120
much more determined so much more

284
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,399
efficient

285
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,200
i learned how to do more in less time

286
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
because i had no room for error

287
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
and gene and juliet pushed me to become

288
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,680
the leader i had been wanting to become

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,120
they positioned me in front of sales

290
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,000
they sent me on critical events they

291
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,519
shared my success stories across the

292
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:46,560
company

293
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
and officially i landed my promotion and

294
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,560
i had been waiting for it for so long

295
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,720
and i couldn't believe it had finally

296
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,560
happened

297
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,600
so i last i became a manager i have a

298
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,240
small team of amazing people

299
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,839
and

300
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:05,680
i just remember having this moment in

301
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,079
which i remember when i first started my

302
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,440
job at cyber reason our ceo leor div

303
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,200
kept talking about how cyber reason was

304
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,120
some meritocracy

305
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,120
and to be honest i really thought that

306
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
was like bs i was like yeah right

307
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
meritocracy sure buddy

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,640
but

309
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,160
it all came because i had been passed so

310
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,000
many times by privileged individuals

311
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,640
that i really did stop believing that i

312
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
would ever get my shot

313
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,560
and he also spoke about the importance

314
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,040
of company values and i was like

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,959
very very incredible

316
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,760
but

317
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,560
he proved me wrong and i no longer carry

318
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,120
that chip around my shoulder it's gone

319
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,640
and

320
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,360
now i'm at a position that i'm

321
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,440
i'm given the opportunity to give a

322
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,279
chance to newcomers

323
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,560
i arrived

324
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,880
i get to lead a team of remarkable

325
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,279
individuals from all walks of life i get

326
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,639
to see them grow

327
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,519
and

328
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,639
help them choose their path into i.t

329
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,079
i truly enjoy motivating them

330
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,880
and that's why i'm here today i really

331
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,959
really want to motivate others

332
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:14,000
with hiring capabilities particular

333
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,399
particularly to get out there get out of

334
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,560
your comfort zone focus on the

335
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,639
importance of trades

336
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,959
versus certifications

337
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,440
you can support your hires later you can

338
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,200
get them certified once they're in

339
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,360
believe me if you have the right people

340
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,200

348
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,920
lottery of luck honestly being born in

349
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,680

357
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,680
that i can train people on these methods

358
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,760

359
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,920
escalations and train people on how to

360
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,800
do so i am truly an expert in customer

361

success and the return on investment i

have brought to other companies as a

363
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,399
single contributor and now it's a team

364
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,480
lead is massive

365
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,880
i i can say this with confidence because

366
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,800
i know i earned it

367
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,760
