00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:02,800
happy friday and welcome to cactus con

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:03,679
10.

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:05,600
i'm so pumped for the opportunity to

4
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,839
share about the threat hunting topic

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,440
this discussion today is going to be

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,360
designed for security practitioners

7
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,679
looking to get into threat hunting and

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,560
for organizations looking to start or

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:17,840
learn more about a threat hunting

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,520
program

11
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,600
while threat hunting can provide unique

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,680
value to a security operation getting

13
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,439
started can be daunting

14
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,320
measuring progress can be difficult

15
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,920
and communicating business value could

16
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,760
be a significant challenge

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,760
that being said i'm hoping to share a

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,760
few things that i've learned on my own

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,640
journey

20
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,480
in threat hunting and hopefully i can

21
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,480
help those interest in the topic get

22
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,480
started in the discipline and help

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,760
organizations mature measure and provide

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,840
real business value with threat hunting

25
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:50,399
operation my friends welcome and let's

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,320
get right into it

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
so i wanted to provide something that

28
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,559
everyone would be able to benefit from

29
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,520
today so whether you've you're new to

30
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,920
the concept of threat hunting or

31
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
your seasoned veteran

32
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
i wanted to provide a presentation that

33
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,439
you might be able to take something away

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,080
from so whether that's a new mindset a

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,560
new value to prioritize your

36
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,640
your current threat hunts a new

37
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,799
understanding of why would threat hunt

38
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,840
or concepts to threat hunt for and and

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,759
reference hunts themselves to perform in

40
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:25,759
your own environments

41
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,759
to be able to provide these resources so

42
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,000
i hope you guys enjoy and get value out

43
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,119
of this

44
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,840
i'm going to cover hopefully a helpful

45
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,680
understanding of what threat hunting is

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,720
for sure

47
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,759
what its role is in security operations

48
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,439
why you might want to perform threat

49
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,680
hunting and finally how to mature threat

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,720
hunting operations in your organization

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,200
but first the obligatory boring stuff

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,240
about me

53
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
the main takeaway here

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,479
is i've had many opportunities to grow

55
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,280
in threat hunting and threat intel

56
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,280
and uh many of them are just by virtue

57
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,280
of being a part of the threatened health

58
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,759
research communities voluntarily

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,759
the spirit the experience i gain from

60
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,439
each organization

61
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
it directly helps me feedback value to

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,959
the others in my primary day job at

63
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
grand canyon education

64
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:16,239
that's where i practice most of my

65
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
threat hunting

66
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,160
i'm also tasked with other detection and

67
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,400
response engineering projects there as

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,120
well

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,120
on the operation sides primary threat

70
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,319
hunting and incident response in

71
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,000
actra i also have the opportunity to get

72
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,120
in give a threat intel that fuels threat

73
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,160
hunts

74
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,840
for those who don't know actra or

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,840
arizona cyber threat response alliance

76
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:40,560
is

77
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,519
an alliance of member organizations that

78
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,720
share um anonymously intelligence tips

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
with each other

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
so this is a great resource for

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,040
new and emerging threats and we focus on

82
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,000
threats at our security vendors aren't

83
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
already covering very well so it's

84
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,000
always actionable information so this

85
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,800
that's a great resource for me

86
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,599
um

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
and then within the cyber resiliency

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,760
institute and the sports i sell i

89
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,760
benefit mostly from the threat research

90
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,080
activities doing that i do there um i've

91
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,840
had opportunities to do things like

92
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,680
serving with the cough team for

93
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,760
the olympics and we'll be able to be

94
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
able to do those again and again just

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,000
learning from the community at large and

96
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,760
there's a whole community of threat

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,840
researchers out there

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,519
you know you can

99
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,519
learn hunts and identify things

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:32,640
techniques to hunt for in your

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,920
environment and get good information

102
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,519
about it from reddit

103
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,360
there's people like me who try to throw

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
up githubs from others there's blogs on

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,840
linkedin there's tons of resources there

106
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,519
that really make it

107
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:45,680
accessible and

108
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,840
my hope is that after going through this

109
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,760
presentation it'll it'll seem very

110
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,920
accessible very achievable

111
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,439
and so i just wanted to talk about this

112
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
community because

113
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,280
i am where i am today because of the

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,200
communities in cyber and because of my

115
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,760
co-workers and

116
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,000
there's community resources from threat

117
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,560
hunting typically either someone has

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,239
a product or service that they want to

119
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:09,120
sell you

120
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,720
or

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,920
someone's discovered something or

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,360
created something that's valuable to

123
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,439
them and they took a bit of extra time

124
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:16,238
to

125
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,238
format it and package it up and make it

126
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,759
accessible to the community and this is

127
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
this is what i like to do that's why i'm

128
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,560
here today

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,240
and uh i know a lot of you are also

130
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,560
contributors to the community so um i'm

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,080
excited to get more people involved in

132
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,840
threat hunting it's definitely an

133
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
operation that's empowered by the

134
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,520
community and i think you know it takes

135
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,240
a

136
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,040
a team to really tackle these advanced

137
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,040
threats and you don't have to work at

138
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,560
the same organization to be on the same

139
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:43,759
team

140
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:44,560
so

141
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
i've enjoyed writing a few blogs on

142
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,040
unique or interesting threats

143
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,120
that i find interesting at least

144
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,800
i do share most of my resources on

145
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,040
github just because it's resource that

146
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,520
others can improve and contribute to

147
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,720
very easily

148
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,639
and it's a resource that i'm already

149
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:01,919
familiar and comfortable with using our

150
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,160
platform that i'm familiar with

151
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,800
and i'm really excited also about my ise

152
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
squared magazine articles that i've been

153
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,479
a part of namely all aboard for

154
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,160
fundamentals i got to contribute to and

155
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,360
coming soon i had the awesome experience

156
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,199
of co-authoring a home on the range

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,600
article and what i'm really excited for

158
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,160
i believe home labbing is

159
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,000
near essential to learning cyber

160
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
security at least perhaps in the

161
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,840
beginning i got a huge amount of value

162
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,360
out of it that's also a huge part of

163
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
where i am now and how i came to know

164
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,479
what i know but really more importantly

165
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,080
it's it's where i was able to develop

166
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,360
the skills

167
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,120
uh the modest skills perhaps but the

168
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,479
skills that i have that gave me the job

169
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,400
opportunities i enjoy and i still

170
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,840
continue to train and learn from my home

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,080
lab even though i feel blessed with

172
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,000
being able to access you know tons of

173
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,520
resources from the community from those

174
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,520
other orgs i'm a part of for my own

175
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,720
organization i still really benefit from

176
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,880
exercises that i do in my homeland

177
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,680
but my biggest claim to fame

178
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,319
is i can exit them without googling

179
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,639
so back to the good stuff

180
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:05,120
threat hunting um

181
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,680
we have a lot of poorly used words i

182
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,919
feel like in cyber security or at least

183
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,000
vaguely used hacking

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,319
breach threat hunting purple teaming i

185
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,840
think these words can mean different

186
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
things to different people um like

187
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,759
breach for example how many times have

188
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
you heard someone say assume you are

189
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,120
breached

190
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,600
so all right like is a ciso who's told

191
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,120
to assume he's breached does he draft a

192
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,680
disclosure now or later you know maybe

193
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,199
there's better words maybe compromise is

194
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,199
a better word maybe um you know assume

195
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:34,880
adversaries are in your network stuff

196
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
like that because that that's a term

197
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
that's a a

198
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,919
concept that i'll use later to discuss

199
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,319
the threat hunter mindset but

200
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,240
you know that shows hopefully that

201
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
some issues are just that of semantics i

202
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,919
believe with the term threat hunting and

203
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,680
with some of these other terms that

204
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,479
there are helpful and maybe some perhaps

205
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,520
unhelpful

206
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,919
definitions understanding of these words

207
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,520
um you know we all kind of joke about

208
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,160
sometimes how things can get kind of

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,680
glamorized

210
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,720
in marketing and so sometimes things can

211
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,120
can lose their meaning so on one end of

212
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,840
the spectrum there's you know precise

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,599
process and you have actual threat hunts

214
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,280
and you have step by steps

215
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,440
process and you have queries and and all

216
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:20,319
that good stuff and you have um managed

217
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,319
threat hunting services

218
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:23,840
that have their own sets of queries and

219
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,759
their their own things that they review

220
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,440
and analyze to try and identify threats

221
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
for you and on the other end there's

222
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:32,560
this um more conceptual way of thinking

223
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
about threat hunting

224
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,960
it's a mindset and i think both both are

225
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,639
helpful but you know if your sock

226
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,199
manager or you know ift security manager

227
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,039
or team lead or whatever says hey we're

228
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,599
getting intel about x or you know we

229
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,160
just saw y in our network and i want you

230
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,560
to do some threat hunting okay well what

231
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
does that mean um is that a product that

232
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,280
you implement is that a product you buy

233
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,440
is that just log review

234
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
is that just looking at untriaged alerts

235
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,759
that didn't make it to the thresholds of

236
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,720
the

237
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,879
volume of alerts that your sock is

238
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,000
managing

239
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,319
is it ingesting threat intel feeds and

240
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,080
reviewing the real-time hits in your

241
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,080
environment you know i think there's

242
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,919
helpful ways of understanding that i

243
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,199
don't i think threat hunting could be a

244
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,120
little bit more than that one of the

245
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,400
motivations for this presentation was

246
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,319
what i thought was maybe less than

247
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,599
helpful uses of that word in our

248
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,520
industry and i thought that we can get

249
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,199
more value out of it and i thought if we

250
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,280
were had a good strong working

251
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,799
definition

252
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,479
um i think that threat hunting's

253
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,760
actually something that can provide

254
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,039
unique value so it is a mindset but we

255
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,760
have to clarify some terms i think first

256
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,640
so

257
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,800
this is just one definition i i'm sure i

258
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,399
can google other definitions that i'd

259
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,720
like more but i wanted to at least try

260
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,920
and capture some of the thoughts i

261
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,680
wanted to convey today so

262
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,760
maybe threat hunting is

263
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,839
trying to take a proactive approach to

264
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,480
detecting existing compromises

265
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,399
typically focused on advanced threats

266
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,720
that have bypassed our existing security

267
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,640
controls there are better definitions

268
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,279
out there but hopefully you know this is

269
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,279
going to help us help set us up for the

270
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
rest of our talk today

271
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,080
mature threat hunting also needs to be i

272
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:15,680
would argue

273
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,240
value adding effective measurable

274
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,640
scalable and data-driven

275
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,760
another motivation for this discussion

276
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,560
was actually a anecdotal story from one

277
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,120
of my friends who was working in a

278
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,240
security

279
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,240
team at an organization a rather large

280
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:35,519
organization and the an executive heard

281
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,279
that they need to be doing threat

282
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
hunting and i think you know some good

283
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,160
concepts were conveyed but there wasn't

284
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,760
proper vision for what threat hunting

285
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,200
looked like they hired someone for the

286
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
role of threat hunting and knight and i

287
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,040
don't think it was beneficial for the

288
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,680
company or the individual um there's a

289
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,680
lot of spinning wheels you know they it

290
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
was hard to really execute on um and so

291
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,880
i think that

292
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,200
having a correct helpful understanding

293
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,959
of threat hunting for that organization

294
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,800
really would have maybe changed the game

295
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,120
really maybe would have made that a more

296
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,120
valuable endeavor

297
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,640
so that's my hope today

298
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,680
so

299
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,360
that's a little bit about the concept of

300
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,120
threat hunting where does it fit in we

301
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,000
have

302
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
in my mind a few different efforts that

303
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,800
we're always pushing for in cyber

304
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,800
security at least i like to categorize

305
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,120
my work into some of these some of these

306
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,480
different categories visibility

307
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,680
detection

308
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
protection

309
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
for sure i think threat hunting's a

310
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,120
detection

311
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,440
effort you know traditionally we're

312
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,880
reactively

313
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,800
responding to alerts i actually think

314
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,160
that salk

315
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,440
efforts have a higher return on

316
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,959
investment i don't think that

317
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,640
large-scale threat hunting's you know

318
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
for every organization um i think that

319
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,000
every organization certainly could take

320
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,760
advantage of threat hunting to some

321
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,040
extent

322
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,480
but truly if we're thinking about what

323
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,000
we're doing it's you know it's a little

324
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,079
bit reactive we're waiting for alerts to

325
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:56,959
come in

326
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
um and this new

327
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,519
perhaps approach to detection from an

328
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:02,959
analyst perspective is going to be

329
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:06,079
proactive hunting there is you know

330
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:08,240
a huge industry that's working on

331
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,079
evading the security controls that we're

332
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,360
using to defend our organizations

333
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,360
so with that concept of reactively

334
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,120
responding to alerts i wanted to talk

335
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
about that a little bit more and

336
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
hopefully clarify

337
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,040
um

338
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,600
i i like to break this up and to think

339
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,839
about a hunter or defender both are

340
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,600
important again i would actually make

341
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
perhaps an unpopular

342
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,880
claim in the threat hunting community

343
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,120
that sock for most orgs going to be a

344
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,800
higher return on investment or a

345
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,079
traditional sock um there these are the

346
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,279
things that our security controls are

347
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
telling us hey you should really pay

348
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,160
attention to that instead we're trying

349
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,920
to go to our data that just tells us

350
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,680
what happened and figure out what we

351
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,279
need to pay attention to

352
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,040
um

353
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,399
so thread hunting is going to be

354
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,720
proactive you're searching for the

355
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,560
threats evading common detection tools

356
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,040
you rely on

357
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,519
now while a hunter can lean on

358
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,000
automation and i think there's a lot of

359
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,160
value in building out your queries

360
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
running reports and scheduling searches

361
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,360
and reviewing summaries of your searches

362
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,800
and um

363
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,839
automation

364
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,920
can really be a force multiplier for

365
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,200
threat hunting

366
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,519
it's a there's a active

367
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,360
proactive you know

368
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,000
an analysis of this to discover the

369
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,160
threats instead of just being you know

370
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,279
provided with the threats that our sock

371
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,519
and sock detect engineers and detection

372
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,040
engineers have been able to create for

373
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,160
us as well you know as well as our

374
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,720
security vendors so while socks kind of

375
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,440
waiting for an alert prepared an ambush

376
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
prepared to ambush any would-be invader

377
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,760
at the various checkpoints the hunters

378
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,200
seeking out the prey and the nooks and

379
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,720
crannies of their territory i really

380
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:47,519
like

381
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:50,800
um to think about the

382
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,040
you know the evasions that come out

383
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,360
um again if you spend time on reddit in

384
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,720
2021 there was a lot of um

385
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,000
evasion

386
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,320
talk in there especially for edr but

387
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,959
also for c2 you know there's all that's

388
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,959
always a whack-a-mole game trying to

389
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,279
respond to the latest evasion tactic but

390
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,360
um i've seen a lot of um threads about

391
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,760
people discovering hey you can bypass

392
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,440
this um you know endpoint protection

393
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,399
solution or you know an edr solution

394
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,639
and it won't throw off a trigger there

395
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,399
one of the things that i'm i've also

396
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,399
seen a lot of linkedin discussion about

397
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,920
more so recently

398
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,839
is yes it's it's evading the trigger

399
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,079
although an alert but that that uh

400
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,920
data about the event is still there so

401
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,920
we as hunters can still

402
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,839
take advantage of that and get value out

403
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:44,160
of that so that's uh you know one of the

404
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
places that's one of the places where to

405
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,839
try and provide value so that's center

406
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,880
versus defender now hunter versus prey

407
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,880
this is where i like to feel like threat

408
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,320
hunting could turn the tables on the

409
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,240
adversary we're focusing on those that

410
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,639
are trying to evade our detections and

411
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:01,199
trying to prohibit them from doing that

412
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,199
um so some questions that we're talking

413
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,560
about thinking about why we're getting

414
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,639
into threat hunting do threats exist on

415
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:08,079
your network today

416
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,600
um

417
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,040
all of your all of your security alerts

418
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,959
may be triaged or at least you know all

419
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,680
all of within a certain time frame

420
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,320
but that's maybe not the same question

421
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,399
and that's why threat hunting you know

422
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,519
we're going to be looking at delivering

423
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,000
compromise assessments

424
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,000
are your systems sufficient to catch a

425
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,720
wicked panda a viceroy tiger or fancy

426
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,959
bear these advanced persistent threats

427
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,199
and these are you know some of which

428
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,079
focus on evasion but even now commodity

429
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,120
malware

430
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,279
i would argue or what you know i feel

431
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,800
like is commodity malware just with the

432
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,279
vast volume um of its and its

433
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,320
prolificness are certainly

434
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,519
uh playing a strong game for evasion um

435
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
a lot of these

436
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,160
have particular um bypasses to existing

437
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,680
security controls

438
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,120
um

439
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:00,639
and that's that's something that um

440
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:01,760
that's something we have to consider

441
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,959
when we're looking at our active

442
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,120
defenses and how well they're performing

443
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,519
against what's out there so we can kind

444
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,320
of play the big game hunting uh the big

445
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,199
the give a game hunting game too

446
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:15,279
just like it takes a skilled

447
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,519
um adversary

448
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
we could take a skilled focused hunter

449
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,399
to identify the persistent threats

450
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,399
um you know there's all these reports

451
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,720
that come out we can read we've i've

452
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:29,839
been able to read a few since 2021 ended

453
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,440
um

454
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
and they talk about the

455
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:36,720
the uh dwell time while that shortening

456
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
uh which i think is interesting in and

457
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,399
of itself that the dwell time of some of

458
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
these attacks before you know the action

459
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
on objective is taken

460
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,519
is shortening

461
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,240
um a lot of these threats it can exist

462
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,360
for months

463
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,880
and

464
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:53,120
they can remain undetected while they're

465
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,639
you know silently working on

466
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
accomplishing their objectives so

467
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
let's attack the adversary and that's a

468
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,720
spoiler alert because that is the

469
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,480
framework that we're going to be

470
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,639
focusing a lot of our efforts around and

471
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:05,920
i think that's always helpful to have a

472
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,920
framework and i've looked at the you

473
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,600
know there's other existing and helpful

474
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,079
frameworks but this one serves a use

475
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,240
case that's very beneficial to how we

476
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,519
can try and approach something that's

477
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:17,120
maybe a little bit more elusive like

478
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,399
threat hunting

479
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,800
so talking more about the deliverables

480
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,360
for traditional sock to help

481
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,279
you know flush this out

482
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
sock traditionally is working on alert

483
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
triage

484
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,880
security controls telling them about

485
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,519
suspicious or noteworthy security events

486
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,360
that are happening on the network

487
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:37,120
analysis

488
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,519
takes place and a

489
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,199
you know judgment value is given a

490
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:42,720
decision is made this is a false

491
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,480
positive it's true positive but we

492
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,240
expect it and it's uh you know okay for

493
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,680
our environment or it's true positive

494
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
and escalation is needed this is

495
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,639
suspicious activity

496
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,320
more of course you know they're handing

497
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,680
off to another stock analyst they need

498
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,120
more an analysis to to determine

499
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,920
and we're primarily looking at you know

500
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,839
the the typical alert sources that we've

501
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,680
been going to presentations to learn

502
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,319
about for for years um

503
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,640
and a lot of these are good resources

504
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,400
and good data sources for the threat

505
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,640
excuse me for the threat hunter

506
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,400
i'm certainly not making

507
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,919
the claim that we should be ignoring

508
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:18,400
these but these are also

509
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,799
a good list of things that adversaries

510
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
are trying to bypass or evade

511
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,880
and

512
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,959
so we're going to be relying we want to

513
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
rely on them a little bit less

514
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,480
the threat hunter

515
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
on the other hand delivers a compromise

516
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,960
assessment in my mind as opposed to you

517
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,039
know an alert that has been triaged at

518
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,559
the end of the day

519
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,520
um

520
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,799
you have something you start with

521
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,679
something you want to look for in a

522
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:44,000
system or a network or part of your

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,440
network or whatever the scope of your

524
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
hunt's going to be and at the end of the

525
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,840
day within the confines of that hunt

526
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,039
you're reasonably certain that the

527
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,000
system is safe secure or you're

528
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,360
reasonably certain that the system is

529
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,960
compromised you found positive as

530
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,000
evidence

531
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:01,120
and it's uh not benign and expected from

532
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:02,799
your network and it needs to be

533
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:04,000
escalated

534
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,400
um or of course uncertain

535
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
further analysis needed

536
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,640
in thread hunting um these are i tried

537
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,000
to think of some of the things that you

538
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,640
know most most likely start with you

539
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:15,840
know we talked about the data sources

540
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,840
for sock and so some of the things that

541
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,720
trigger hunts for fair hunters queries

542
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,840
filters um theories um hypothesis

543
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,080
operational intel i really love hunts

544
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,120
driven by operational intel um we'll get

545
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,039
into that in a little bit here

546
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,400
custom internal black lists of

547
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,080
indicators attack or indicators of a

548
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,320
compromise especially applying that in

549
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,640
my mind i'm thinking of historical

550
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,160
application of that and looking against

551
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,280
historical data and

552
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,960
anomalies from baselines and a whole

553
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,480
bunch more you know machine learning

554
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,280
inspired detections and tons of stuff

555
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,678
like that

556
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:54,840
all right so the obligatory cyber

557
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
presentation sun tzu quote every good

558
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,880
presentation has one

559
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:01,280
in hopes of being one of those i made

560
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,520
sure to include it um i actually found

561
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,799
it really helpful for breaking up the

562
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,120
concept of threat hunting

563
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,880
um so we know how to tell if our sock is

564
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,960
a sock we could tell if our stock is

565
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:13,039
doing well or if the security product x

566
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,280
is doing well but threat hunting i think

567
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,960
as we're still maturing in this as an

568
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,480
industry and as a lot of organizations

569
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,280
are adopting this and i see you know job

570
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:23,360
applications for threat hunting i think

571
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,000
that that's still something that

572
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,679
you know i think some works are still

573
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:29,200
working on some some of us are still

574
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,720
working on and one of the reasons we're

575
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,720
doing this talk today so talk about this

576
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,960
new discipline i want to borrow from sun

577
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,200
tzu's wisdom

578
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,440
do is five things

579
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,799
quote there is therefore measure in

580
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,720
terms of these five things the five

581
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,400
things are the way the weather the

582
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,799
terrain the leadership the discipline

583
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:48,880
now taking this from the application to

584
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,840
military strategy and war and applying

585
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
it to threat hunting the way sun tzu

586
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:55,440
says means including the people who have

587
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
the same aim as leadership so that they

588
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,840
will share death share in life without

589
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,679
fear of danger

590
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,559
i know this this presentation is titled

591
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,320
the art of threat hunting but i really

592
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,000
think more broadly threat hunting could

593
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,880
be a mindset you know a discipline it

594
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
you know it's just a different

595
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,559
approach to detection

596
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:15,760
above all

597
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,240
start with why and don't forget it and

598
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,480
this is one of the key um things i'd

599
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,159
like to communicate today we're trying

600
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:23,919
to perform something different than the

601
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,360
sock we're trying to fulfill a different

602
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
goal we're not trying to duplicate sock

603
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,080
efforts

604
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:31,039
and um this is actually ironically also

605
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,679
a point where i wanted to mention that

606
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,360
sock experience

607
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:38,720
and incident response experience and the

608
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,720
um tribal knowledge or institutional

609
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,559
knowledge or whatever you guys call it

610
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,440
at your org and the um experience of

611
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
triaging and making judgments uh

612
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,280
decisions about if something is benign

613
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,240
or malicious that really lends itself to

614
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,000
this new threat hunting approach um

615
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,840
and you know i for example i was talking

616
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,280
about cyber security in general and how

617
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,720
permeates our life

618
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,159
you know in this case we're talking

619
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,679
about the way more specifically threat

620
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,280
hunting this this isn't necessarily a

621
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:12,000
red team i've seen job applications

622
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:12,880
where

623
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,960
they were looking to hire someone for a

624
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,480
role that performed both red team and

625
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,520
threat hunting and while an organization

626
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,200
i'm sure there's many individuals

627
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,559
probably many individuals in this call

628
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,360
that would

629
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
that would excel at both

630
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,600
um you know a lot of the

631
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:30,720
skills

632
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,159
of day-to-day

633
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:35,600
red team activity like using rapid seven

634
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,520
uh you know hate instance of cobalt

635
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,440
strikes setting up cubot

636
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,640
um

637
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,280
don't necessarily lend itself to the

638
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,200
analysis of the logs that we're going to

639
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,679
be talking about looking through

640
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,120
however

641
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,080
i

642
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,520
i do love

643
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,600
this idea of red team and blue team

644
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,360
overlapping and

645
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,200
the engagement between both and i think

646
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,120
threat hunting needs to be a part of

647
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,240
that if that's happening at your

648
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,480
organization because part of what threat

649
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,080
hunting tries to do is cover the gaps

650
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,240
that the sock cannot cover whether

651
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,520
that's due to

652
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,280
um you know

653
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:10,640
the nature of the security controls that

654
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,640
we have existing no lack of security

655
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,960
controls or just um you know where we're

656
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,880
at in the industry i think that that

657
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
overlap is important but perhaps some of

658
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,919
the the data that you're going to be

659
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,280
familiar with doesn't necessarily

660
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,919
overlap that so you know a purple blue

661
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,120
teamer should and can benefit from um

662
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,919
red team exercises understanding the

663
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,840
kill chain being able to perform some of

664
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,679
those exercises themselves totally an

665
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,880
advocate for all of that but we're

666
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,360
looking a lot at understanding

667
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,520
um techniques in the mitre attack

668
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,039
framework

669
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:44,480
excuse me

670
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,640
forensics art under for understanding

671
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,120
forensics artifacts

672
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,880
and those sorts of things um

673
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,320
understanding what logs are and where to

674
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,000
find them now the weather the weather

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,799
means the seasons for us um

676
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,000
you know i think

677
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,520
talking about

678
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,760
new raz providers when a new raz

679
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
provider that's very mature releases a

680
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,320
linux variant um keeping track and

681
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
keeping you know known cesa's known

682
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,960
exploited vulnerabilities um knowing if

683
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,120
you can knowing if you can detect that

684
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:15,840
in your environment knowing about emotes

685
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,320
reawakening or even a new emoted

686
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,440
campaign thing patch tuesday zero days

687
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,240
all this stuff that's really the the

688
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:27,280
current available knowledge and threat

689
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,520
intelligence that we have

690
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,600
in our industry today

691
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,240
is included in the weather

692
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,159
i really like the focus of operational

693
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:38,320
intelligence here just because that's

694
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:40,320
you know is applicable to

695
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,400
uh you know more attacks than just

696
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,080
tactical intelligence and

697
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,000
we will definitely get into the

698
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,840
delineation between those if that's a

699
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,640
new concept the terrain is to be

700
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,480
assessed in terms of distance difficulty

701
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,600
ease or travel dimension and safety

702
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,600
also i love

703
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,840
one of my favorite quotes that i just

704
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,159
recalled from the first time i read the

705
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,760
art of war the one that stuck out to me

706
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,799
that i thought was just the coolest

707
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,400
sounding if you know the enemy and you

708
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,679
know yourself you need not fear the

709
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:12,400
result of 100 battles now the adversary

710
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,960
is coming on to your domain so

711
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,640
you can know

712
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,440
and part of this is tribal knowledge you

713
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
should know your strengths and

714
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,159
weaknesses you should know where your

715
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,840
crown jewels are that you're trying to

716
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,440
defend and what the adversaries might be

717
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,840
going after based off of their actions

718
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,200
that they're trying to take objective

719
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,480
off of you know

720
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,520
um knowing your osit footprints knowing

721
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,240
what actors um especially you know we're

722
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,840
talking we're often thinking about

723
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:39,760
advanced persistent threats

724
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,120
um or at least very mature and capable

725
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,919
threat actors knowing what they often go

726
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:48,159
for

727
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,799
classifying devices with external

728
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,640
service services in your environment so

729
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,400
you can identify and understand those

730
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,679
too based off of where they're at in

731
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,120
your network knowing your own

732
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,720
vulnerabilities

733
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,799
the goal here i think is to predict the

734
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,440
path that the adversary might take i

735
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,159
love

736
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:06,559
a project called bloodhounds knowing

737
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,000
your app vulnerabilities and service

738
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,279
vulnerabilities

739
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:12,480
these are all key to understanding um

740
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,480
yourself so that you can understand what

741
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,039
the adversary's um experience might be

742
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,200
as they try to compromise you

743
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,799
in order to direct our threat hunting

744
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,480
now leadership is a matter of

745
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,480
intelligence trustworthiness humanist

746
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:28,960
courage and sternness

747
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,960
um i think threat hunting certainly

748
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,400
requires a concerted effort and this

749
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,880
becomes so important if you have more

750
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,480
than one or two people

751
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
um

752
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,159
if with good leadership the some of the

753
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,279
hole can become greater than the

754
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,200
interval individual contributors and

755
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
that's the goal for every operation that

756
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,320
we

757
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,520
you know that we

758
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
take on

759
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,960
um and i think it's just

760
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,480
much more important with threat hunting

761
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,600
because we're trying to create our own

762
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,400
you know incidence events to investigate

763
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,120
out of large data sets so unlike the

764
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,120
sock where an individual alert comes in

765
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,120
a sock analyst can claim it

766
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,720
and work on it and then maybe if they

767
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,559
need to they can pull people in

768
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:10,240
um but you know there's an event that

769
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,080
they've that they're able to work and an

770
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,000
alert that they're able to work threat

771
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:17,520
hunting doesn't work like that um

772
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,120
if you're not careful if you have a

773
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:20,960
large team with red hunters they they

774
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,240
may spend

775
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,240
the vast majority of their time

776
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,960
overlapping each other's efforts um so

777
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,440
there's leadership involved here

778
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,520
and um

779
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
i think also

780
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,880
that

781
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,320
a proper vision

782
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,080
is important for the threat hunting

783
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,000
operation like i had noted before the

784
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,320
story of a friend whose orig

785
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,080
leadership i think was on to the on the

786
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,480
right track wanted to get involved in

787
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,840
dread hunting knew

788
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,520
that the existing security controls

789
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,360
weren't sufficient um but didn't have

790
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
proper vision for that and

791
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,520
ultimately it did not work out

792
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,039
um i think the leadership also

793
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,880
communicates business value and makes

794
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,640
sure that results are delivered because

795
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,600
again

796
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,760
threat hunting can be cool i love taking

797
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,679
a new hunt taking someone else's idea

798
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:07,200
trying to learn how i can apply it to my

799
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
environment to discover new threats um

800
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,279
but if you're just kind of perusing

801
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,440
reddit throwing a few searches off of

802
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,240
your own environment you know is that is

803
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,679
that search sufficient in its current

804
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:18,840
state to

805
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,880
identify um

806
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,480
the threats that you need you know how

807
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,440
are you making sure that you're actually

808
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,279
contributing to the defense of your

809
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,840
organization and we'll talk about that

810
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,080
but i think this that part of the the

811
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,679
presentation today is going to be

812
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,200
something that needs to come

813
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,799
from the leadership level whether that's

814
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,880
a title leadership or just someone on

815
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,559
the team who takes

816
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,039
takes the baton and runs with it

817
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,720
that that might be very from work to org

818
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,880
but leadership's certainly key

819
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,880
the discipline means organization chain

820
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:51,919
of command logistics and so this is this

821
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,600
is where where i

822
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,760
um

823
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,159
you know i've noted multiple times

824
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,799
sock probably has a

825
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,559
greater return on investment in your own

826
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,919
organization as it is even with the

827
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,000
mature threat hunting operation it's

828
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,559
just the sox handed the alerts that are

829
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,320
trying to indicate that hey something

830
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,080
that someone thought at one point was

831
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,600
already malicious and

832
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,559
um for for organizations out there um

833
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,720
now we're trying to take a more uh more

834
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
of a scalpel approach where we're trying

835
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,559
to take an idea and a concept to

836
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,559
identify technique and applying it to

837
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,760
our own organization and um filtering

838
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,159
out the the stuff that tribal knowledge

839
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,559
can provide so it's much more fine-tuned

840
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,559
and much more personalized for

841
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,240
organization

842
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:36,960
but

843
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,919
um

844
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,159
you know it's going to be it's going to

845
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,799
be more and analytics there's been more

846
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,640
analysis involved

847
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,799
so chain of command and logistics are

848
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,720
really important here you need the

849
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,960
actual threat hunters to focus on this

850
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,720
and not that

851
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,440
it's easy to duplicate efforts if you're

852
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,360
just kind of throwing analysts at the

853
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,360
task of threat hunting and you don't

854
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,480
want to chase rabbits down every hole

855
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,200
i really like having a notepad where i

856
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,039
can save things that i'm interested in

857
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:08,559
but

858
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,559
you need to actually complete

859
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,480
your threat hunts in order to provide

860
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,880
value

861
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,679
so a method to kind of record and not

862
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:20,559
replicate analysis is crucial i think

863
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,600
especially you know from day to day

864
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,320
so the message here is stay on target

865
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,799
prioritize focus your hunt bring it to

866
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,960
completion i'd say

867
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,880
i think that a single completed and

868
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,799
conclusive threat hunt is probably going

869
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,760
to serve your organization better than a

870
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,919
dozen of incomplete and inconclusive

871
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,320
threat hunts if that helps

872
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,039
so

873
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:45,200
where does threat hunting it fit in sock

874
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,120
ir engineer you know who do they work

875
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,240
with

876
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
i think that the goal threat hunting is

877
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,559
to identify new investigation leads

878
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,159
i think that

879
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,120
you know they're going to be starting

880
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,880
with queries automation they'll be

881
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,320
starting with the hypothesis and those

882
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,840
you know will be starting your

883
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,679
environment and then there's going to be

884
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:06,880
scope reduction um

885
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,799
you know log filtering and eventually

886
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,480
you want to get down to where you have

887
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,080
individual events that you want to

888
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
analyze and dig into just

889
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,120
a lot like how you would a uh a sock

890
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:19,520
alert i think um often that's the case

891
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:20,480
at least

892
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,480
um but i think that that it kind of

893
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
exists perpendicular to the sock um

894
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:27,120
role

895
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,480
and i have a

896
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,520
beautiful stick diagram here that i hope

897
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,600
communicates to us this now when i first

898
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,960
started presenting on thread hunting

899
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
these were actually titles and i quickly

900
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,640
realized um

901
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,039
through actually my work with actra that

902
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,520
many sectors have different

903
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,039
titles for things and different terms

904
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:46,720
for things and

905
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,960
one always sounds cooler than the next

906
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,559
so i realized

907
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,640
we all wear different hats a lot of us

908
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,120
have one title and different titles

909
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
actually but we perform some tasks so

910
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,039
it's kind of a little messy i'd say um

911
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,279
so with that in mind i tried to stick to

912
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,120
functions so there's security control

913
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,519
that exists it sends an alert or notable

914
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,399
event to an analyst to triage and that

915
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:12,080
perform that that generates an

916
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,120
investigation lead um that's

917
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,360
brought to completion either it ends

918
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,600
there it's a false positive or it's true

919
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,320
but you know not relevant for your

920
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,320
security operations maybe it's a

921
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,159
penetration tester or it's a

922
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,399
red team activity red team automation or

923
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:31,919
maybe your red team and purple team are

924
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,279
working together with some purple team

925
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,840
activity whatever the case you know that

926
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,320
that ends there or it gets pushed on you

927
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,760
investigate and analyze it and you

928
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,000
execute a response in the same capacity

929
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,080
a threat hunter is leaning on massive

930
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,600
amounts of raw data

931
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,760
enriched by the intelligence available

932
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,720
today

933
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,399
in the often

934
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:52,159
realized in the forms of reports or

935
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,120
queries against logs in your environment

936
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
they perform the threat hunting where

937
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,880
the sock analyst performs the triage on

938
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,799
alerts and eventually an investigation

939
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,440
lead is produced moves on to investigate

940
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,760
it to be investigated and analyzed and

941
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:09,120
eventually a response is executed

942
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,840
so that is where it fits in

943
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,600
now let's talk about the methodologies

944
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
um you know i really hope this is a good

945
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,519
place where when you start to read

946
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:18,799
information about hunts that are out

947
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,480
there you can really start breaking it

948
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,240
down understanding how to apply it to

949
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,760
your environment so

950
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,279
in this case we are assuming threat

951
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,480
active is already in the network this

952
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,760
really is a role of the threat hunter

953
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,640
they are um tasked with assuming there's

954
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,760
threats in the network that have been

955
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,679
missed and that have bypassed our

956
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,519
security controls that's that's why it's

957
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:37,360
proactive because we haven't been able

958
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:38,880
to identify it we're not being received

959
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:42,480
an alert so we're going to proactively

960
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,080
look for that adversary hidden in our

961
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,039
data

962
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,840
so investigations can be driven i think

963
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,760
in two different ways they can be

964
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,600
hypothesis driven and this is with

965
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,760
operational intelligence

966
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,399
so once you identify this you know

967
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,000
the threat hunter will be looking for

968
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:59,919
specific behaviors in their network

969
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,320
trying to identify the the existence of

970
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:05,440
certain techniques um certainly helpful

971
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,519
and awesome are are hunts that can

972
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,600
combine techniques to show you events

973
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,600
where not only

974
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,480
did x occur but y also occurred as well

975
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,799
it's bringing the something theoretical

976
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:18,799
or something that uh occurred in someone

977
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:19,760
else's environment that we have

978
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,360
intelligence on and being able to

979
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,799
identify it in your own environment

980
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,200
while also excluding any false positives

981
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,880
from your search or

982
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,720
expected activity

983
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,240
investigations

984
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,159
can also be fueled by known observables

985
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,840
and these are the tactical

986
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,120
types of data if you're familiar with

987
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,880
the different types of data

988
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,399
we can cover that in a moment

989
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:40,240
if you're not but these are where

990
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,159
indicators of a compromise and

991
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,799
indicators of attack occur also

992
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:46,159
frequently referred to as cyber

993
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:48,000
observables in the industry and these

994
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,440
can help us identify things that missed

995
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,640
the missed

996
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,960
signatures detections in our buyer

997
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
circuit controls um by nature of at the

998
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:00,960
time of occurring perhaps the

999
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,840
firewall or intrusion detection solution

1000
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:06,559
or endpoint agent didn't know about a

1001
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,480
specific indicator and on top of that

1002
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:11,119
the type of attack was performed was

1003
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,800
evasive by nature and um we can identify

1004
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,159
those by

1005
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:18,719
pulling our our intelligence of today

1006
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:22,079
and throwing it at our data of the past

1007
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
also certainly advanced analytics

1008
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,199
machine learning inspired

1009
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,560
hunts can occur

1010
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,520
um user and entity behavior analytics

1011
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,599
produces a lot of data a lot of cool

1012
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,760
data often that you can also hunt

1013
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,199
through um exploit detections rare log

1014
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,480
items those sorts of concepts baselined

1015
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,119
you know network activity or use or user

1016
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:46,800
activity falls into user entity behavior

1017
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,639
analytics but baselines and anomaly

1018
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,040
detection i think are also great um

1019
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,800
fuels for those types of investigations

1020
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,800
where you have an individual hit um

1021
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:56,159
you're not just looking for a type of

1022
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:57,520
technique but you have an individual hit

1023
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,520
in your network and you're tasked now

1024
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,680
with investigating that

1025
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:05,119
so i um started to notice

1026
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:06,960
when i was actually presenting on threat

1027
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,000
hunting

1028
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:08,720
the

1029
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,359
um some similarities in the progression

1030
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:13,440
of a spectrum that exists in data

1031
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,119
information and knowledge and

1032
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,240
you know when we're talking about this

1033
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,480
largest volume of data and that at the

1034
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,160
exist at the bottom whether that's the

1035
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,359
threat intelligence that we have in

1036
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:23,760
terms of indicators or email addresses

1037
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,119
or or

1038
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,880
dns names records or file hashes um you

1039
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,760
know that exists in large volume

1040
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,119
and then as we live move up to

1041
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,520
operational intel you know knowing um

1042
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:37,440
what the techniques are being performed

1043
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,160
applying those to mitre um you know

1044
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,599
something that and she's doing a lot

1045
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,440
right now both in terms of the threat

1046
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:45,280
intelligence industry and the detection

1047
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,800
industry and i'm really excited about

1048
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,640
the um you know convergence of both of

1049
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:49,440
those

1050
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,960
or strategic knowledge where we're

1051
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
looking at adversaries objectives and

1052
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,280
larger things right there but

1053
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,720
in in most of these cases whether it's

1054
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,400
intelligence in our own environment or

1055
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,920
the data that exists in our environment

1056
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,200
that we're pairing our intelligence with

1057
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,480
there we go through i think a similar

1058
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,560
process of you start with the large

1059
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,560
amount of data and you collect it you

1060
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,560
organize it and sort it

1061
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,320
eventually you know you start to perform

1062
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,160
some some sort of analysis on it and

1063
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,240
that brings you up the pyramid to

1064
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,480
summarizing maybe you're filtering out

1065
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,839
data that's not needed and you're

1066
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,760
reducing you know making summary indexes

1067
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
is a popular thing amongst sims and

1068
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,400
analytic platforms um then you start to

1069
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,640
get into analyzing and making sense of

1070
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,599
that

1071
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,000
and creating some information about the

1072
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,839
underlying data

1073
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,119
eventually you want to you know

1074
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,480
synthesize reports and eventually get to

1075
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,000
decision making and we always really

1076
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,720
want to bring it to completion our goal

1077
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,400
is always to make a decision to take

1078
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,920
some action

1079
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,000
and on a similar in a similar side just

1080
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,680
with the breakups of the types of

1081
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,760
information that's involved you might

1082
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,640
have a threat intelligence plot program

1083
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,480
at your organization and that might

1084
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,560
start with threat feeds and real-time

1085
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:58,400
alerting and then maybe you move up into

1086
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,000
threat hunting when you get the the

1087
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,480
operational intelligence as well and you

1088
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,040
prioritize engineering tasks um based

1089
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,480
off of the intelligence that out that's

1090
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,599
out there making sure that we're

1091
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,400
protecting against the um techniques

1092
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,800
that are being used when possible that

1093
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,880
can also fuel an incident response and

1094
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,359
then maybe you're getting more advanced

1095
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,359
in the analysis and the resources that

1096
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,119
you have in terms of threat intel and

1097
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,880
you're doing actor profiling for your

1098
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,599
organization you're doing business risk

1099
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:28,160
and cyber security certainly

1100
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:29,520
communicating business values to

1101
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,359
communicate it as a business risk and i

1102
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:33,040
three i think threat intelligence can do

1103
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,400
that when you're looking at the threats

1104
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:36,400
that are facing your organization

1105
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,240
and being able to compare that to those

1106
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
threats as they have faced other

1107
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,359
organizations and what that meant for

1108
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:43,520
those other organizations

1109
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,040
and eventually you know if your

1110
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,480
organization takes it up to that level

1111
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:48,160
doing threat research and contributing

1112
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,839
back to the community that allowed you

1113
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,359
and empowered you to

1114
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:53,119
be able to bring that to your

1115
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:56,240
organization bring that value

1116
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,440
so

1117
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:59,440
one simplistic way i like to think about

1118
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,960
after giving all that information i hope

1119
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,960
that maybe i wanted to bring it back a

1120
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,680
little bit and say threat hunters can

1121
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,920
use the knowledge afforded

1122
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,240
by today to find threats that have made

1123
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,119
it in our past past our detections and

1124
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:15,599
prevention security controls yesterday

1125
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,280
obviously it could be longer than

1126
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
yesterday but we're trying to take the

1127
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,079
knowledge that's afforded to us and

1128
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:24,640
apply that information to the data that

1129
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,800
exists so this certainly does require

1130
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,839
and rely on historical data it it's not

1131
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:32,079
impossible to do threat hunting on a

1132
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,000
day's worth of data but

1133
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,000
the intelligence that's out there you

1134
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:38,400
know might not be as as rarely

1135
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:40,480
available to serve that

1136
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,680
so

1137
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,200
i want i didn't want to talk about that

1138
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,920
as it relates to the tactical side of

1139
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,200
threat hunting and this threat

1140
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,200
intelligence or you know i think the raw

1141
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
data i like to talk about threat data

1142
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,040
and break that up into operational and

1143
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,280
data um kind of

1144
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:57,440
sides of the of the coin so with the

1145
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:59,119
operational we're talking about tactics

1146
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,520
techniques adversary profiling tools

1147
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,720
processes

1148
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,280
targets objectives etc those sorts of

1149
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,880
things with the data we're talking about

1150
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,440
our typical cyber observables data names

1151
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:12,800
asn siders mutexes emails subjects

1152
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,440
registered keys you get the idea um

1153
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,359
those are they both are helpful um but i

1154
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:21,839
wanted to note i do hear a lot of people

1155
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:24,240
today saying threat intel

1156
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,000
particularly i think they're referring

1157
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,640
often to threat data feeds and threat

1158
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,480
data these indicators are garbage

1159
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:34,720
and i don't disagree with the sentiment

1160
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,079
or really what they're trying to

1161
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,839
communicate when they when they say that

1162
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,359
or the frustration that they're feeling

1163
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:42,000
at least i do get um i do get the

1164
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,680
frustration

1165
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:44,640
we

1166
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
a lot of us have gotten to the point

1167
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,400
where we're taking massive amounts of

1168
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:49,920
threat data feeds and we're throwing

1169
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,119
them at our real-time

1170
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:56,320
detection solutions and are you know

1171
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,079
looking at our net flow activity in real

1172
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:00,400
time and our endpoint at real time and

1173
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,760
it's cheap it does it's not

1174
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,280
computationally expensive and there's a

1175
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,520
lot of free resources or you know cheap

1176
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:07,200
i got cheap extra licenses from our

1177
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,520
vendors so you know it's it's worth

1178
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,599
doing you know i think but

1179
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,119
a lot of people have been disappointed

1180
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,680
with the efficacy of that um i've heard

1181
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,359
uh actually you know someone i was

1182
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,359
learning from and who i totally respect

1183
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:21,680
and um who's taught me a lot i heard

1184
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,079
them say if the ip was from last week i

1185
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:26,880
don't care about it who cares um if an

1186
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,359
indicator came out about a specific

1187
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,319
hostname a month ago or last week or

1188
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:33,520
whatever

1189
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,800
um

1190
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,880
and again i get that you know the

1191
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,880
complaint here is that we're trying to

1192
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,359
use threat intelligence that um we've

1193
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:42,960
discovered you know maybe a week two

1194
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,119
weeks maybe a month maybe three months

1195
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:46,800
after the attack

1196
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,280
to defend attacks in real time and

1197
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,319
we all you know we don't even talk about

1198
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,920
we're not even focused on polymorphic

1199
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,440
malware now hashes are always going to

1200
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,640
be different now even entire

1201
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,760
hosts are set up um on vps's or um aws

1202
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,440
or digitalocean

1203
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,599
their entire instances set up under

1204
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,760
entirely new domains for a specific

1205
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,920
attack or a specific campaign and

1206
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,560
they're gone and i and so i get that so

1207
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:16,160
but i think though i think we're trying

1208
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
to fit you know a round

1209
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,079
peg into a square hole if you install a

1210
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,520
screw with a hammer you're gonna have a

1211
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,200
lot of flaws and a lot of things to

1212
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,200
complain about the screw and so i just

1213
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:27,440
wanted to note um for the threat hunter

1214
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,839
that the time attribute is a value

1215
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,079
property of your threat data remember we

1216
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:32,960
can

1217
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:35,839
take this intel from today and hunt in

1218
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:36,880
the past

1219
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,200
and we can use that data to keep around

1220
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:40,640
for our investigations when we're

1221
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,920
hunting

1222
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,440
they could be triggers for own hunting

1223
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,160
so yeah you might not

1224
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,599
protect yourself from an emerging threat

1225
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,720
by

1226
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,359
running it against a threat data feed

1227
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,680
you may and this is one thing that i've

1228
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,079
learned well from our arizona cyber

1229
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:00,079
threat response alliance we we try to

1230
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:02,319
keep the action at the information that

1231
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,760
we share with the member organizations

1232
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,359
that we share with each other we try and

1233
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,359
keep it actionable and so often that

1234
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,720
means you know the data is not old

1235
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,839
because everyone in the security

1236
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,920
industry either knows about it or it's

1237
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:13,920
no longer applicable um when we find out

1238
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:14,960
about it

1239
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,800
just because the adversary's moved on

1240
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,960
but why not throw that against an hour

1241
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,280
of data from two weeks ago or from a

1242
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:23,040
month ago

1243
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,280
you might find that threat intel

1244
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,480
performs better when it's actually

1245
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,720
complementing the time frame that it was

1246
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,359
created in so i hope that that is a

1247
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:35,200
helpful concept for threat hunters who

1248
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,359
use tactical data to drive their threat

1249
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,200
hunts don't just look at the last 24

1250
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:41,119
hours

1251
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,640
all right so

1252
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,400
this is a great example i have two

1253
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,800
examples of my githubs up here and i

1254
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:49,280
really um part of this presentation is

1255
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:50,480
uh

1256
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:52,720
well i could say requires audience

1257
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,160
participation

1258
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,400
and so by that what i mean is i think

1259
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:58,480
really to get a comprehensive good good

1260
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,319
feel of of everything i would really

1261
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:03,599
love i think after the presentation go

1262
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:05,280
and look at mine or other people's

1263
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,440
threat hunts there are tons out there i

1264
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,280
have two that i provide that are

1265
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,280
relevant to our talk

1266
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,440
but i will provide links for those at

1267
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,880
the end you can pause you can copy it

1268
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,880
down or just search my name and search

1269
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,680
the

1270
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,960
repository for this but sunburst is a

1271
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,240
great example of threat intelligence and

1272
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,079
a threat that real-time detection

1273
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,480
providers they didn't know about um so

1274
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,599
we had to

1275
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,520
resolve resort back to proactively

1276
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,520
searching for the presence of the

1277
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,359
techniques and indicators historically

1278
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,359
in our environment and this was this is

1279
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,440
required for those of us who were you

1280
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:41,440
know digging into sunburst and with that

1281
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,440
we were able to kind of determine that

1282
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:44,960
you know we didn't see the evidence or

1283
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,680
that we were a stage one or stage two or

1284
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,359
i think the term that was used then was

1285
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,359
phase one or phase two um you know

1286
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:53,839
target but you know this is this is a

1287
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,520
great example where we are can't just

1288
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:57,119
rely on the

1289
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,599
the detections coming into us and

1290
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,640
sitting back and and taking those on

1291
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,680
and then as we learned about the

1292
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:05,839
post-compromised techniques that were

1293
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,040
used and the behaviors that were

1294
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,280
exhibited we were further empowered with

1295
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:11,680
the you know intelligence of today as i

1296
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,440
said to look for threats in our

1297
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
environment yesterday so to speak the

1298
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,000
sunburst threat hunt

1299
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,839
i particularly like for as an example

1300
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,760
just because it has both the tactical

1301
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,000
and operational intelligence side of it

1302
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,680
there are indicators there there's a

1303
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,040
whole bunch of different indicators

1304
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:28,880
there that that you probably have

1305
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:29,839
already looked through for your

1306
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:31,680
environment and apply that to your sim

1307
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,440
historically and try to look through you

1308
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:36,000
know your the apis of your endpoint data

1309
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:37,680
collection tools or whatever whatever

1310
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,119
that looks like for your or you try to

1311
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:40,640
apply that and you may have also done

1312
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,079
some operational intel maybe you were

1313
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,920
looking for sample tokens that didn't

1314
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,079
have the default one hour time to live

1315
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,240
or you were looking for other you know

1316
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,640
behaviors and techniques that were used

1317
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,760
by that adversary so this is a resource

1318
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:55,760
again if you would like to review that

1319
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,240
feel free to pause or just copy it down

1320
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,640
for later use

1321
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,400
log forge this is a great example of a

1322
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,319
threat that was evolving just too

1323
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,160
quickly for real-time threat detection

1324
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,640
to to take care of it threat detection

1325
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,400
wasn't cutting it and we needed some

1326
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,400
more manual analysis so in this

1327
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,960
repository i have there's two different

1328
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,599
hunts but i also you know welcome and

1329
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:19,200
challenge you to go look for that and

1330
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,480
throw it against your environment if you

1331
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,720
still have logs from what was that the

1332
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,079
december 10th

1333
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,440
um oh 500 utc or whatever when the scans

1334
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,760
really started to to kick off throw it

1335
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,440
against that and

1336
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,880
you know these are hunts that you can

1337
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,560
try out in your environment and i hope

1338
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,640
that log forge one i made with the

1339
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,000
intention of there's a lot of

1340
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:39,280
screenshots there's it's very

1341
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,240
step-by-step so hopefully that's very um

1342
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,079
accessible to people who are just

1343
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:45,680
getting into this

1344
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,839
but the real reason log forge is is

1345
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:49,760
really relevant here i think is just

1346
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,920
because again of that evolution of the

1347
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,079
attack so quickly i just chose one

1348
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:55,920
vendor i think that in my opinion this

1349
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,000
is actually a vendor who does a good job

1350
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,160
at um creating signatures for the for

1351
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,079
their their customers um but you could

1352
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,079
see they had to evolve as a threat

1353
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,599
evolved you know we would create a way

1354
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:07,440
of detecting it we were looking for the

1355
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:11,280
you know jndi ldap or dns or cobalt or

1356
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,520
or ldap or whatever it was and we were

1357
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,200
looking for those strings and then all

1358
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,960
sudden you know they came out the lower

1359
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,359
or upper strings to

1360
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:21,440
resolve the the

1361
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:23,280
complex string that was evading

1362
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:25,280
detection in some cases for those who

1363
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,680
are using blacklist prevention and that

1364
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,359
just kept evolving there kept being new

1365
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:31,040
ways and in this

1366
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:32,480
left side you can see the vendor coming

1367
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,000
out with new signatures in the middle

1368
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:37,200
you could see a list that shows

1369
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,960
a bunch of the different ways of trying

1370
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,040
to bypass detection

1371
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,960
and i tried to write regex for that that

1372
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:44,000
you can also

1373
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,160
access in the repository and then on the

1374
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,280
right side you can see where we're

1375
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,040
actually trying to extract those those

1376
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,160
threats and actually go through our

1377
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,119
threat hunting process and be able to um

1378
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:55,200
conclusively you know look

1379
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,680
comprehensively look for all the attacks

1380
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,000
not relying on our security controls and

1381
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:01,359
that was one thing that we were just

1382
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:02,880
looking at web logs we're looking at

1383
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:05,440
netflow and web you know proxy logs or

1384
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,359
if you have um web traffic from your

1385
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:09,599
firewalls we were purposely not relying

1386
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:11,599
on detection controls for that entire

1387
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:13,920
hunt for the purpose of you know one

1388
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,680
communicating a point but two we

1389
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:17,119
couldn't because it was changing so

1390
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
quickly

1391
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:20,400
so

1392
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,720
this resource is available and

1393
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,760
again

1394
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,200
i hope that's helpful to you and at

1395
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,960
least service is an example

1396
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,359
so who can threat hunt you know do jesus

1397
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:30,880
say anyone i really do think that you

1398
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:32,400
know with the guides that are out there

1399
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,040
now i have started when i started i have

1400
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,640
benefited so much from resources that

1401
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,240
were out there and i attended so many

1402
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,000
talks with people saying hey you know

1403
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,920
use this search and and you know they

1404
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,680
walk through some hunts but i just felt

1405
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,200
like um while there's a ton of great

1406
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,040
resources out there you know i felt like

1407
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,200
a comprehensive um

1408
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:53,200
uh process wasn't um out there to mature

1409
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,480
it and

1410
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,000
um you know i certainly think that those

1411
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,160
were good threat hunts but i'm hoping

1412
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,520
that this is a good presentation about

1413
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,960
threat hunting program and actually

1414
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,960
trying to operationalize it

1415
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,880
um but so i think we're talking about

1416
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,480
who's best suited for it and so i think

1417
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,960
network smees endpoint smees and i i

1418
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,480
just at this point i want to say you

1419
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:11,520
know i think people who've been through

1420
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:13,760
sock and a little bit instant response i

1421
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,760
think really are well suited towards

1422
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,920
this type of activity

1423
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,240
so yet another playbook but hopefully

1424
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:22,880
one that's truly um valuable for those

1425
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,559
who are have some threat hunters or who

1426
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,160
have a sock with some extra time they

1427
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,319
want to get into thread hunting so we

1428
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:30,000
need a process that is repeatable

1429
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,640
scalable and we need to measure

1430
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:33,359
our

1431
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:36,480
our progress we need to deliver value so

1432
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,599
that requires deliverables um and so we

1433
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:41,119
need to continuously focus on

1434
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,160
improvement it needs to be a little

1435
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,920
agile just because the threats that are

1436
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,079
out there are changing so much so

1437
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,880
i um use this and i wanted to share this

1438
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,960
with others it's really i try to make it

1439
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,400
as simple as possible there's other ways

1440
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,440
to come up with thread hunts but in

1441
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,920
terms of measuring your growth i liked

1442
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:59,280
this identify a miter attack technique

1443
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,520
and i think that this can be prioritized

1444
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,440
for your organization either try to use

1445
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,119
the minor matrix to look at your

1446
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,480
coverage as it relates to other tools or

1447
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:10,800
look available intelligence out there

1448
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:12,079
about what threats exist and what's

1449
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:13,920
going on in the world but

1450
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:15,200
you want to identify a technique and

1451
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,160
then with that technique you want to

1452
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,359
find your goals are you collecting

1453
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:18,960
telemetry or do you need to do that can

1454
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,720
you report on it can you detect on it

1455
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,240
eventually you want to mature to that

1456
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:23,760
then you want to execute the technique

1457
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:25,520
in your environment and this might feel

1458
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:27,119
like purple teaming but i really just

1459
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:28,319
feel like there's so many red team

1460
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:30,319
resources that are out there that a blue

1461
00:49:30,319 --> 00:49:32,640
teamer a goofy blue teamer like myself

1462
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,960
who only does a red team in conference

1463
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,359
cts every once in a while um if i could

1464
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:38,720
do it anyone else can do it a lot of

1465
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:39,839
them are copy and paste i'm going to get

1466
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,839
into that in a moment but so you execute

1467
00:49:41,839 --> 00:49:43,200
the technique somewhere in environment

1468
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,359
so you can collect the analytics since

1469
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,000
you can collect them the um the data

1470
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,240
that is generated by that

1471
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,079
and then you design and tune your search

1472
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:53,920
and profit but you need to make sure you

1473
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:55,280
measure it

1474
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,079
so

1475
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:56,960
um

1476
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,640
really briefly hopefully you know this

1477
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,760
is something that's familiar with the

1478
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:01,119
industry because i'm excited that

1479
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,240
there's so many more people talking

1480
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:03,440
about this and so many vendors using

1481
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,599
this it's been a helpful immeasurably

1482
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:08,079
helpful resource for me i literally back

1483
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:10,079
in the day took the time tried to read

1484
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:12,319
through it and didn't read every

1485
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:13,680
technique but if i didn't understand the

1486
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:15,599
technique i clicked on it and you know

1487
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:17,760
sometimes read that the summary that was

1488
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:19,920
really a good experience for me and

1489
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,440
growing my knowledge on in cyber

1490
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:22,480
security

1491
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,559
so i wanted to use minor attack because

1492
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,800
we can measure our capabilities maturity

1493
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,160
against an existing knowledge base

1494
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,240
that's used throughout the industry um

1495
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:31,760
just as it exists you can go there and

1496
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:34,319
you can attach links um to the different

1497
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:35,280
techniques and the different sub

1498
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:37,520
techniques you can add comments so i did

1499
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,280
that and i would have reports and

1500
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,880
searches and whenever it was more

1501
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,000
appropriate to have one another you know

1502
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,119
i'd throw in a link and throw on a

1503
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:45,359
search and i'd be able to comment about

1504
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:46,880
you know how often you know the number

1505
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,160
of events that were there so i can

1506
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:49,359
understand how often i should look at

1507
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,680
that if it was 30 a day maybe that was

1508
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,400
worth looking into if it was 300 a day

1509
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:55,760
then you know i needed to tune that more

1510
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,200
that wasn't really actionable or maybe i

1511
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,720
looked at it once a week or something

1512
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:00,480
like that and tried to sort through it

1513
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,280
at a higher level but this is where i

1514
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:05,280
realized that this was a really helpful

1515
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:07,119
use case because

1516
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:09,040
there was some other projects that also

1517
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,520
used mitre and this is where you know

1518
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,599
that that playbook that i gave you

1519
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:15,520
really is easily accessible to i think

1520
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,839
anyone because not only does mitre serve

1521
00:51:17,839 --> 00:51:19,839
as a model for us to measure our

1522
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,920
capabilities and our growth but it's

1523
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,559
also standard that other resources are

1524
00:51:24,559 --> 00:51:26,800
already mapped to such as red team

1525
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,800
automation and the atomic red team is a

1526
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:30,640
phenomenal resource

1527
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:32,000
and it's what i

1528
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,240
use to try and identify techniques even

1529
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:35,280
still

1530
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:36,640
and it's growing and you can contribute

1531
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,920
to it too and i love that and i think

1532
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:39,599
that's really cool now you can also you

1533
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,720
know um use red team automation stuff to

1534
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,200
emulate adversaries like prelude or get

1535
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,040
a actual red teamer in there and i've

1536
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,800
heard of organizations challenge their

1537
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,480
threat hunting team by you know making

1538
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:52,640
them detect a red teamer without any

1539
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,960
security learning data just you know the

1540
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,839
actual endpoint data or network data um

1541
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,040
from zeke or something like that and i

1542
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,480
think that's cool you know that those

1543
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,960
are good exercises and i i love the idea

1544
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:04,640
of that don't you know don't stop doing

1545
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:06,160
that but

1546
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:07,680
you know i do want to make sure we are

1547
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,200
considering what our socrate does

1548
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,200
because threat hunting is not doing

1549
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:12,319
anything if the socks already

1550
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:14,559
identifying it so you know just consider

1551
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,720
your socks existing stuff and i think um

1552
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:19,040
mitre helps do that so you know

1553
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:21,760
literally just from my ide as i was

1554
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,839
working these through um you know it

1555
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:26,559
does it maps to red team projects that

1556
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:28,480
exist out there also and you can see

1557
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,400
this is uh delete volume shadow copies

1558
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,079
and that's really simple example i chose

1559
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:33,520
examples that i hope most of the

1560
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,200
audience would be familiar with and you

1561
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:36,480
can see you can just copy and paste

1562
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,640
these and it just makes it really easy

1563
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:41,359
to simulate this technique and behavior

1564
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:42,720
in an environment so you can detect on

1565
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:43,920
it and see what it looks like and start

1566
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,480
to build analytics based off of that

1567
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,680
it also mitre does also map to blue team

1568
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,200
discovery projects and again while

1569
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,880
there's many out there

1570
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:54,880
you can look for a technique in google

1571
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,359
there's a cyber analytics repository

1572
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,000
that miner also maps to and this i mean

1573
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,480
it it tries to do as much as it can to

1574
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:04,720
provide this for you um at the bottom

1575
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,319
there it shows an example of splunk and

1576
00:53:06,319 --> 00:53:08,319
sysmon and what you can actually do to

1577
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:10,480
try and identify this exact activity in

1578
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:11,920
your network so i just performed the

1579
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:13,280
activity

1580
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:14,800
in my terminal i copy and paste and

1581
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,640
throw it in the terminal for powershell

1582
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,000
and then it um

1583
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:19,520
and now i have the analytics that i need

1584
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,920
to throw on my sim to detect it and of

1585
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,119
course you know this is an example

1586
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:24,319
splunk but there's there's many others

1587
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:25,520
if you scroll down there's there's

1588
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:26,640
others out there and there will be

1589
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:28,400
different data sources of course

1590
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,160
um so you know this is you know another

1591
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,319
example um from when i was actually you

1592
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:34,079
know working on this and there are ways

1593
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,520
to automate this if you're wanting to do

1594
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,040
that but i'd like to take it piece

1595
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,640
piecemeal wise and kind of go step by

1596
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,920
step but so there's lsas memory dump for

1597
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,720
with proc dump and this is how you can

1598
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,720
make that happen in your environment

1599
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,559
and then again this there's a resource

1600
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:51,040
to identifying it in your environment

1601
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:52,480
um and

1602
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,319
um tons of searches to get you started

1603
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:55,599
and with a little bit of filtering if

1604
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
there's legitimate examples of the

1605
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:59,040
senior environment you can create

1606
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:00,880
reports that you can review to try and

1607
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:03,359
identify abuse of that so and then

1608
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:04,559
finally not only does it map those

1609
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,480
resources but consider what your socks

1610
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:07,680
already doing

1611
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,280
what are they not what are they already

1612
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,640
covering that you can't today this is a

1613
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,640
tool for my home lab um that tries to

1614
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:15,119
automate some of the detection of the

1615
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,319
techniques that i can already detect

1616
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,319
again so it's not complete it's not you

1617
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,680
know your org will look very different

1618
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,520
than this this is just you know lab

1619
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:22,800
environment but

1620
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,960
the idea still stands i could see what

1621
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:26,240
techniques i'm not getting and i can

1622
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,640
focus on those and you you may not be

1623
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,400
comprehensive you may want to validate

1624
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:32,319
that your socks tools can detect that

1625
00:54:32,319 --> 00:54:33,920
and there may be bypasses but this is a

1626
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,559
way of measuring what your socks already

1627
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:38,480
performing so you can try to perform a

1628
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:40,000
net new

1629
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,240
some final thoughts i'll leave you with

1630
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,240
front hunting is most beneficial when

1631
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:47,119
it's um creating value that traditional

1632
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,559
socks

1633
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:50,400
their reliance on real-time learning it

1634
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,799
can't create right so

1635
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:54,559
um the socks because the reliance on

1636
00:54:54,559 --> 00:54:56,079
real time and learning thread hunting is

1637
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,000
trying to solve a different use case so

1638
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,680
consider also minding the gap don't

1639
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,599
duplicate the sock severance don't just

1640
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:02,880
be a second alert to all the socks

1641
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,280
already triaged have a way to document

1642
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:07,200
the current threat hunting efforts break

1643
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,480
up the rules and responsibilities to

1644
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,839
prevent duplication of efforts some

1645
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:11,920
people divvy up the data domains maybe

1646
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,720
uh an edr person who's an expert at that

1647
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:16,000
focuses on that for their shift but you

1648
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,440
want to be able to break that up you

1649
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,280
don't want two people to choose an alert

1650
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:20,640
you don't want two people to triage the

1651
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,280
same data um or the same technique make

1652
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,200
your puns data driven

1653
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:26,079
um

1654
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:27,359
you know leveraging the intelligence

1655
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:29,359
that out there that's out there for your

1656
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:31,520
organization in the appropriate time

1657
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,119
frame or at least you know throwing it

1658
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,200
at historical time frames because the

1659
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,640
time frame that your threat and tell is

1660
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,200
going to be least useful for is

1661
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:40,400
right now

1662
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,400
it's really going to be helpful to apply

1663
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:44,240
it though to those later dates just make

1664
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,720
sure you're complementing the sock

1665
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,119
some brain candy to leave you with this

1666
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:51,359
uh has grown over my presentations but

1667
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,599
just some final thoughts and again that

1668
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,319
resource up there for my github um

1669
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:58,400
because i do think part of what i wanted

1670
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:00,720
to provide you guys is threat hunts that

1671
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,960
this median and the time frame that we

1672
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,960
have doesn't really lend itself to but

1673
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:06,240
those resources are out there to go at

1674
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,520
your own pace and at least just read

1675
00:56:07,520 --> 00:56:09,440
through to understand and get some real

1676
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:10,960
world examples

1677
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:12,240
i've really enjoyed being able to share

1678
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:13,839
this information with you guys i really

1679
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:16,640
hope this was helpful to you um

1680
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:18,240
if nothing else though

1681
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,400
um just talk about it with your friends

1682
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:22,240
if this is all you know stuff that you

1683
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:23,040
know

1684
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:24,799
share with your team share with other

1685
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,319
organizations share what's been

1686
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:27,839
successful for you if you've done threat

1687
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:29,280
hunts if you've identified threats

1688
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,200
without relying on security controls the

1689
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:32,720
threat hunting intelligence is really

1690
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,319
empowered by

1691
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:35,680
people that are out there that share

1692
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,440
their experience so

1693
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:39,040
get a part of the community you'll

1694
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,960
benefit from it and you'll be able to

1695
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:43,440
provide value to others so

1696
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:46,160
