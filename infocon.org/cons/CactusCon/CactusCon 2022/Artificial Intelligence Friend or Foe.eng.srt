1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:01,439
hi

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,360
so i believe this uh this webinar is

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:04,960
being watched from probably multiple

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,879
time zones so i'll start off by saying

5
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,559
good morning good afternoon and good

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,960
evening my name is aaron roose i'm a

7
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:13,120
security architect and uh also a cyber

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,639
security evangelist with the office of

9
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,239
the cto here at checkpoint software

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,880
technologies uh so today i bring to you

11
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,000
a a

12
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,320
what i think is a unique presentation uh

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,920
talking about ransomware which we're all

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,080
very familiar with uh but also looping

15
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
in the idea of artificial intelligence

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
is it a friend or phone now i know ai is

17
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,600
used often as a marketing buzzword but i

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,040
want to show you a little bit of behind

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,600
the scenes of what ai means um and how

20
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,160
it can both complement uh our you know

21
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,600
our security strategies and our

22
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,920
technologies to help prevent ransomware

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,920
attacks uh but also how it could

24
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,160
potentially be used against us as well

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,160
um so let's proceed

26
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,920
so today what we're going to talk about

27
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,760
uh we're going to we'll do a brief

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,079
overview or look at ransomware uh you

29
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,280
know it's on the rise and we'll talk

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
about the causes you know why is it all

31
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,039
of a sudden such a hot topic

32
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,879
um then we'll dive into artificial

33
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
intelligence and look at two different

34
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,520
sides of uh of that of that technology

35
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,040
and then we'll progress into talking

36
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
about some of the invasion tactics that

37
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:11,760
we're seeing

38
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,520
and then we'll go over some best

39
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,960
practices how to prepare for a

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,640
ransomware attack

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,280
so let me move through my slides here

42
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,000
so let's talk about ransomware rising so

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,960
last year we saw a 93

44
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,280
increase in ransomware attacks year over

45
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,119
year um this was pretty interesting and

46
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:32,720
uh if we look at some of the the hot

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,560
topics or the the events that are in the

48
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,040
news we see the cassaya attack the

49
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,840
colonial pipeline accenture

50
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,840
and something unique has been popping up

51
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
over the past say three to four years uh

52
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,840
it's called ransomware as a service so

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,399
we'll dive into that as well um and then

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,920
something that kind of blew my mind the

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,399
idea of ransomware on a mobile device

56
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:53,920
so that's just a brief overview of what

57
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,399
we're going to talk about today

58
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,439
so again looking back at 2021 um you

59
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,600
know two major attacks kind of stick out

60
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,000
uh the cassette attack which is you know

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
you can kind of think of it as a supply

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,119
chain attack in a lot of ways actually

63
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,280
both of these would apply um so this was

64
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,280
a massive attack it affected numerous

65
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,520
organizations i believe the count was

66
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,360
well over a thousand organizations were

67
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,760
impacted uh and that was across 17

68
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,879
countries

69
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,640
the attack was eventually associated to

70
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,920
the russian group are evil and the way

71
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,400
that they were able to bypass antivirus

72
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,400
was to use an old signed version of

73
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,160
microsoft's antivirus

74
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,519
and that would allow them to bypass

75
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,120
those protections

76
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,959
the colonial pipeline something i'm very

77
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,599
familiar with here in north carolina um

78
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,000
you know that attack affected 45 percent

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
of all fuel consumed on the east coast

80
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,480
um i know it definitely affected me you

81
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,800
know i actually had trips uh or or

82
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,080
planned trips to go back home to

83
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,879
kentucky to visit my family and um i

84
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,560
wasn't able to do so because i didn't

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,080
know if i would be able to get gas along

86
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,120
the way

87
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,959
so that was you know a major attack that

88
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,800
hit the news everybody was very aware of

89
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
it and

90
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,720
what we later learned is that

91
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,640
ransomware as a service was used so this

92
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,280
is basically where uh we see you know

93
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,360
mal actors offering their services to

94
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,400
others um to you know to actually deploy

95
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,480
a ransomware attack so uh you know

96
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,000
everything seems to be as a service to

97
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,400
state these days so now we have a new

98
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,280
uh acronym the raas or random emergency

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,440
service raz

100
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,799
so let's look at the evolution of

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,239
ransomware what we've seen over the

102
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:27,040
years

103
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,040
so you know way back if you go back to

104
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:31,519
2013 uh i guess we could call this you

105
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,200
know ransomware we just basically saw

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,920
extortion uh so that's where a computer

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
or computer system or network was

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,159
infiltrated in some way and the data was

109
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,400
used for extortion now you'll see some

110
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,080
dollar figures here so 300 bucks 300 was

111
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,040
the average cost uh you know to to

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,920
basically not have your data leaked um

113
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,239
at that time then we started to see it

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,519
evolving so between 2017 and 2019 we saw

115
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,360
wannacry and not petya

116
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,799
which i'm sure every security

117
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:02,959
professional is very well aware of those

118
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,080
uh of those variants um and we started

119
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,959
to see an evolution not just hey pay you

120
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,439
know pay this amount and uh we'll unlock

121
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,840
your files but we actually saw them say

122
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:14,720
okay

123
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,478
if you want your files back your data

124
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,918
back in the first place you need to pay

125
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,320
us an amount but on top of that if you

126
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,000
don't pay we're going to publish this

127
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
information to you know and probably

128
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,759
sell it off to uh to other male actors

129
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:30,080
out on the dark web um so

130
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
you'll notice the dollar figure you know

131
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,320
drastically increases here up to an

132
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,199
average cost of 15 million um for for

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,479
each attack

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,280
now uh we kind of progressed from 2019

135
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,560
into you know 2020 2021 and now beyond

136
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,000
in 2022 we see ransomware as a service

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,639
so on top of that another trend pops up

138
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,720
called triple extortion so triple

139
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,120
extortion is very unique so you know

140
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,360
double extortion says hey we have your

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,759
files they've been encrypted um if you

142
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,840
want your files back uh then you need to

143
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,520
pay but also if you don't pay we're

144
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,120
gonna publish that on the web

145
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
then they added on and said okay now

146
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
let's reach out to you know business

147
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,600
partners or customers employees and say

148
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
you know we stole data from this person

149
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,520
or this entity um and they have to pay

150
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,000
us to you know to decrypt it they also

151
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,680
have to pay us or if they don't pay us

152
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
we're going to publish it on the web but

153
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
this data is very private to you it's

154
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,120
unique to you might disclose you know

155
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,039
things about a business partnership or

156
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,360
or personal information uh so we also

157
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,520
want you to pay us so we've seen the

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,240
rise from you know 300 is average cost

159
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,479
for remediation and getting your files

160
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,600
back to 15 million uh and then it starts

161
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,680
to stagger upwards to 20 million and 40

162
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
million and beyond uh so we can see that

163
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,520
there's you know a lot of effects here

164
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,199
there's a lot of costs it's not just

165
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,600
dollar figures we're also talking about

166
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,520
you know brand reputation and pr and

167
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,560
such um so very unique and and

168
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,479
unfortunate how we've seen this you know

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,919
the evolution of ransomware

170
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,080
so let's talk a little bit about why

171
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,479
this is happening um so as we're all

172
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,800
aware uh the you know the dark times of

173
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,880
2020 2021 with the uh with the coven 19

174
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,919
um

175
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,000
uh happening across the world you know

176
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
many businesses were challenged all of a

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,880
sudden we had to say okay we have all of

178
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,400
these employees they can't come to the

179
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,160
office however you know our business

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,520
still needs to make money we need to be

181
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,479
alive

182
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,479
and we need to service our customers so

183
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,080
we had to say all right

184
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,600
you can work from home

185
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,039
and a lot of people you know work from a

186
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:34,639
lot of different locations it might not

187
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,720
just be home uh you know some people

188
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:37,680
have

189
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,360
maybe very loud environments they have

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
children playing their partners and

191
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,000
family um so people started using you

192
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,160
know other locations like uh co-working

193
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,800
spaces or starbucks or even i've seen

194
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,160
people take meetings out of their cars

195
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,599
if they have to i know i've done it as

196
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,800
well um so people are accessing data not

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,360
just from you know the four walls of of

198
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
the traditional office they're you know

199
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,120
on their mobile devices they're on their

200
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,039
tablets you know their phones accessing

201
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,000
data

202
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,280
they're at home

203
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,199
they're not just doing web browsing you

204
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,800
know they're accessing cloud services

205
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
whether that be infrastructure or

206
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,319
software as a service type

207
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:14,560
solutions they're using other solutions

208
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,160
like you know remote desktop and

209
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,080
accessing internal files and resources

210
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,160
in a way that typically you know no one

211
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,479
ever did um and you know a lot of

212
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
businesses had to scramble a lot of uh

213
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,400
i.t people had a lot of late nights you

214
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,960
know trying to find a way to to allow

215
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,160
for you know remote workers

216
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,680
so let's look at the uh you know the

217
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,039
tactics the techniques and the

218
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,120
procedures behind this um so if we look

219
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
at the miter attack framework we can

220
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
kind of map this out we'll go into

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,880
greater detail later um but

222
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,520
the the general ideas that we saw or

223
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,120
tactics that we saw were privileged

224
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,039
privilege escalation um and then

225
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:51,680
establishing persistence um a lot of

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,360
them you know a lot of these variants

227
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,599
started employing techniques that would

228
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,560
prevent uh forensics from happening so

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,080
you know giving us all the data so that

230
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
we can prevent future attacks and and

231
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,520
understand what the effect was of this

232
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
current attack um we also saw a lot of

233
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,599
user imp uh impersonation uh issues so

234
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,280
this would be you know

235
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,039
an attack where they typically are

236
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,280
looking for specific types of data or

237
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,039
collecting data um and they would

238
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,280
compromise you know saml uh certificates

239
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,360
to create some sort of unauthorized

240
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
token um but it did look real and it

241
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,720
allowed them access to uh to you know

242
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,400
internal or private uh resources

243
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,840
so let's talk about artificial

244
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,039
intelligence

245
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,919
now

246
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,679
we'd like to say ai is the next

247
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,360
industrial revolution i'm gonna kind of

248
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,159
walk you through why we say that so if

249
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,159
we look at the industrial revolution you

250
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,240
know the whole idea behind it was we're

251
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,720
going to um use machines you know

252
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,600
machines are very precise um so it was

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,279
about replacing you know muscles with

254
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,760
machines uh they're you know in general

255
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,200
machines are stronger they're more

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,160
accurate they don't get tired um so

257
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,680
what's interesting here is we're now

258
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,000
kind of at the dawn of a new uh

259
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,240
industrial revolution where we're going

260
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:05,920
to be replacing you know essentially the

261
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,600
human brain in a lot of ways with

262
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,440
machines as well so artificial

263
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,279
intelligence because it's much more

264
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,680
precise it doesn't get tired

265
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,600
and it can typically compute things a

266
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,760
lot faster when we're looking at large

267
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,839
data sets

268
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,519
so a lot of people might be asking okay

269
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,080
why why now why is artificial

270
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,760
intelligence all of a sudden something

271
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,440
that's so important or something that

272
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,040
we're hearing about a lot

273
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,040
uh there's there's a multitude of

274
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,200
reasons but we'll try to summarize uh

275
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,839
the reasons here so number one uh

276
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,640
storage i don't know if uh how many of

277
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,320
you have been in the it space for a long

278
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,080
time but i'll jump back a number of

279
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
years when i was in in high school and i

280
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,040
purchased my first usb thumb drive uh

281
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,320
that thumb drive was maybe

282
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:54,080
120 megs or so uh 128 and i think i paid

283
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,080
maybe 75 bucks for it and i still have

284
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,000
that thing i wish i actually had it on

285
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,720
my desk here and i'd show you uh but now

286
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,240
it's kind of crazy you can go out and

287
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,279
buy terabytes uh worth of data or

288
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,519
storage uh capacity that will fit in

289
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
your pocket very easily in fact you know

290
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,560
my phone alone has a ton of memory um

291
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
and it's quite impressive how much can

292
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,240
fit inside of my pocket these days so

293
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,760
you know the cost of storage in general

294
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,519
has gone down

295
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
um then we look at compute you know

296
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,519
compute power is is incredible these

297
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,600
days you know uh again that phone there

298
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,079
could it could have powered um you know

299
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,720
launching a rocket uh 30 or 40 years ago

300
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,640
with its compute power so compute is

301
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,399
getting very very cheap

302
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,240
um and then also we've had some major

303
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,079
break breakthroughs inside of uh

304
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,880
mathematics you know uh ai is is just a

305
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,040
bunch of algorithms that we use to you

306
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,959
know to teach so you know machine

307
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,040
learning deep learning all of those big

308
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
data analytics tools um we've had some

309
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,120
major breakthroughs in the past four to

310
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,680
five years

311
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
so what does it take uh to create an ai

312
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,040
solution

313
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
um you know again back to storage we

314
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,760
need data and a lot of it and it needs

315
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,240
to be very rich and accurate data to uh

316
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,320
to train our models from but then on top

317
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,800
of that we also also need expertise so

318
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,000
the people that are creating these

319
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,440
models the people working behind the

320
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,760
scenes need to have not only expertise

321
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
in artificial intelligence how it works

322
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
and how to train it uh but they also

323
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,680
need expertise in their domain um and of

324
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,040
course the domain that we're talking

325
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,160
about right now is is cyber security

326
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,040
now

327
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:27,440
let's look at you know how ai works or

328
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:30,240
let's look at how ai might be you know

329
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,600
implemented in our everyday lives that

330
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
we're not even aware of

331
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,839
here's a common example i can't say her

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:37,200
name because she'll activate here in my

333
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,360
office but speech recognition speech

334
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
recognition was huge

335
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,279
you know just a few years ago was really

336
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,560
when it started to come about and we

337
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,320
have all these connected devices in our

338
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,839
homes whether it's our you know our

339
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,000
mobile phone our tablets our computers

340
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,079
or specific devices that will turn on

341
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,160
and turn off lights and uh

342
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,160
control the majority of your home i

343
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,680
myself you know if i had to count i

344
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,399
would say i have somewhere between 50 to

345
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,560
maybe even closer to 80 uh connected

346
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:04,639
devices in my home now um and they're

347
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,480
all controlled by ai in a lot of ways

348
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,920
you know through the speech recognition

349
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,360
it's very handy

350
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,800
another great example if you think about

351
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,959
self-driving cars you know self-driving

352
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,959
cars are you know they they literally

353
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:17,920
have our uh our lives uh

354
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,320
are at stake so um you know artificial

355
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,079
intelligence and machine learning and

356
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
computer vision have actually been a

357
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,880
huge part of that revolution and uh i

358
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:29,040
look forward to hopefully a more safer

359
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,440
you know world when we're traveling um

360
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,959
as that technology progresses

361
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,120
so let's talk about ai and cyber

362
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,519
security um you know we're seeing uh you

363
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:40,240
know

364
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
it's it's revolutionizing uh cyber

365
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
security in a lot of ways you know again

366
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,519
we're able to

367
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
um teach these machines to do a lot of

368
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
the things that that humans would do do

369
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,040
you know we're trying to teach it

370
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,639
intuition we're trying to teach it how

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,680
to to match on patterns um so i'm going

372
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
to show you a few examples that we use

373
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,120
here at checkpoint you know there's a

374
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,000
lot of other artificial intelligence uh

375
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,519
solutions in cyber security other

376
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,360
vendors and such but i like to focus on

377
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:07,200
at least what i know and what i have

378
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,760
access to as far as how it works

379
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,120
so the first engine we're going to talk

380
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,000
about

381
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,519
or the first technology is called

382
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,680
campaign hunting and this is predictive

383
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,160
threat intelligence so the goal here is

384
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
to enrich our threat intelligence with

385
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,120
predictive indicators of compromise iocs

386
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
so an example of this um a human analyst

387
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,519
you know they're going to be looking at

388
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,040
malicious elements and they can often

389
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,360
trace them back to their origins because

390
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,320
we we notice patterns um so an example

391
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,399
you know a domain registered by you know

392
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,639
the exact same person at the same time

393
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,560
with the with the same pattern when it

394
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,320
comes to what the domain looks like

395
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,480
that's uh that's a way that our brains

396
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,639
are going to say okay most likely you

397
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,519
know domain a and domain b are both

398
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,360
malicious because you know they kind of

399
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,399
follow a pattern um so what we've been

400
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,160
able to do is we can mechanize you know

401
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,480
this analysis um essentially the the

402
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,639
analyst into intuition we're able to

403
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,240
mechanize that and create an algorithm

404
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,360
around it

405
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
so we're now capable of analyzing

406
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,959
millions of known uh indicators of

407
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,120
compromise and hunt for additional you

408
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,800
know uh similar iocs um so we we

409
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,120
incorporated this back in uh july of

410
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,440
2016 2016 and we've seen a 10 percent uh

411
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,040
increase in the amount of attacks that

412
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:22,720
we're able to block based off of this

413
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,000
technology

414
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,160
so it's a pretty cool uh and very very

415
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,279
powerful tool

416
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,600
moving forward another technology of

417
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
ours is called huntress so huntress um

418
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,000
the idea behind it is we're able to

419
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,720
uncover malicious executables um this is

420
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,720
one of the like by far one of the

421
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:43,519
toughest problems uh in cyber security

422
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,519
um you know an executable by nature has

423
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,440
allowed a lot of access to system

424
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,480
resources um and you have to do more you

425
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,000
can't just look at the file name or the

426
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,600
hash you've got to dive in and

427
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,760
understand exactly what it's doing um so

428
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:58,000
we use our dynamic analysis platform uh

429
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,920
just like a sandbox uh to let the

430
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,680
executable run you know just like a bomb

431
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,959
we're gonna see if it explodes and see

432
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:05,360
what it does um so we're going to let it

433
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,519
run and then we're gonna collect every

434
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,040
parameter that we can possibly get our

435
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,720
hands on uh so we're able to get

436
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,959
hundreds if not thousands of parameters

437
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,639
about this executable and what it's

438
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,440
doing

439
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,600
and you know the result that we've been

440
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,279
able to introduce inside of our threat

441
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:22,320
intelligence um is a 13

442
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,800
increase in unique detections uh because

443
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,560
we're combining all of those indicators

444
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,160
of compromise or learning about them

445
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,440
over time

446
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,880
and then using that to establish

447
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,759
patterns to to analyze other files and

448
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:34,560
um

449
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,720
and realize they're similar in nature or

450
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,519
they have similar behavior

451
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,839
now our newest uh addition to the ai

452
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,480
family is called cadet so cadet uh it

453
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,040
stands for context aware detection um so

454
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,639
the idea behind this you know you think

455
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,800
about yourself in your everyday life uh

456
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,800
we have a lot of context around us we

457
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,480
can understand more we're walking you

458
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,320
know down the street if something could

459
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,240
be dangerous or if an area of town could

460
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:00,079
be more dangerous than others how do we

461
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,240
do that we look at everything around us

462
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,759
you know we understand the environment

463
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,279
we look at you know some of the people

464
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,440
we understand their behavior and and

465
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,040
what it appears you know are they

466
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,720
potentially could be malicious are they

467
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,800
acting in a strange way um so we're

468
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,240
pulling a lot of context together to

469
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
make a decision intelligently now we're

470
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,560
trying to do this with ai as well so we

471
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,160
look at the full context of um of of an

472
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,480
element you know we're gonna you know

473
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,880
move across uh the boundaries of the

474
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,880
traditional you know network inspection

475
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,000
but we're also gonna look at you know

476
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,000
the mobile device uh we're gonna look at

477
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,360
the endpoint device we're gonna look in

478
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,720
the cloud we're gonna understand the

479
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,040
full context of an event um to

480
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,360
understand okay you know what did it do

481
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,440
did it access other parts of the you

482
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,040
know the overall infrastructure was it

483
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,759
logging into a sas application was it um

484
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,199
you know was a file potentially

485
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,160
downloaded from office 365 or whatever

486
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,639
your email solution was um and then when

487
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,800
that file was opened on the on the

488
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,680
endpoint um again kind of back to our

489
00:16:57,680 --> 00:16:59,360
previous example with huntress we'll

490
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,880
look at the executable as well and

491
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
understand all of its indicators and

492
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,880
potential um

493
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,880
apologies for us to move my phone there

494
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,439
um and we'll look at all of the uh the

495
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,039
parameters and such

496
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,799
across the board to understand what is

497
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:13,839
it doing

498
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
and we'll take all of those and we're

499
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,480
essentially building a pattern again and

500
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,720
what we've seen is actually a two-fold

501
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,618
increase in our ability to um

502
00:17:23,618 --> 00:17:24,880
[Music]

503
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,520
to uh to detect and then we actually saw

504
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
a tenfold decrease

505
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:30,880
in

506
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,039
excuse me 10-fold decrease in false

507
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,000
positives so overall improving the you

508
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,400
know the accuracy of our solutions um so

509
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,640
it's a very powerful solution

510
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,440
so

511
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:42,880
i know i went through that pretty quick

512
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
but what we basically talked about there

513
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:48,000
was all right how is ai a friend of

514
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,480
cyber security now the next slide that

515
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,840
i'm going to show you is a something

516
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,600
unique and this was just more of a

517
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
thought experiment but i wanted to

518
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,360
analyze how could ai potentially be

519
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,360
harmful in the realm of cyber security

520
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,760
how could it help the attackers

521
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
um

522
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,320
so i'm going to show you this solution

523
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,559
and you know no endorsements or or any

524
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,039
connection to github whatsoever um

525
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,600
but github copilot github copilot is one

526
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,360
of my favorite tools

527
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,760
basically what happened here was

528
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,240
github realized okay we have billions

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,400
upon billions of lines of code you know

530
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,760
people post things in public

531
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,760
repositories all the time

532
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:26,000
so what if we take that code and we

533
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,039
introduce it to an ai solution what if

534
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,640
you know our code editor which is uh

535
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,120
microsoft visual studio code which is an

536
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,880
awesome tool by the way

537
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,559
what if we implemented it into the code

538
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,960
editor to give you real-time suggestions

539
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,520
so at any point in time you can you know

540
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,400
write a comment that says you know a uh

541
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,320
maybe it's node.js and you want to open

542
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,480
up a web server uh like an express web

543
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,480
server you could just do a comment that

544
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,799
says you know a web server exposed on

545
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:58,080
port you know one two three four um

546
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,400
that is serving this content and it will

547
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,400
start to autofill for you it'll help you

548
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,000
with repetitive code as well so if

549
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,919
you're using the same variables or

550
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
you're creating very similar functions

551
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,039
over time it will start to make

552
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,360
suggestions to uh to help speed up your

553
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,000
ability to write this code

554
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,919
another really cool part of this um

555
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,520
it'll also show you

556
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,520
you know ways that you could potentially

557
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,120
rewrite your code to optimize

558
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,720
application as well

559
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
so i started thinking okay

560
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,880
if if it's been trained on billions and

561
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,600
billions of lines of code um

562
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,280
and it can understand you know the

563
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,760
context of what i'm saying in a comment

564
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,840
could i use this potentially to write

565
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,799
some sort of malware could i maybe ask

566
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,720
it to write ransomware for me

567
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
so the next video i'm going to show you

568
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,960
here is me actually trying this so let's

569
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,120
check it out

570
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,799
so this is visual studio code i'm going

571
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,840
to select my language

572
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,640
in this example i'm going to select rust

573
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,400
which is one of the i would say somewhat

574
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,840
newer

575
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
technologies out there or code

576
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,919
languages out there and i write a

577
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,320
function that encrypts all files in the

578
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,679
user's document

579
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,000
directory with the key password

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,840
so let's see what happens as i type out

581
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,360
this comment you'll notice it's already

582
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,600
starting to to autofill

583
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,919
and try to suggest what i'm trying to do

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,320
or give me suggestions so once i finish

585
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,240
the comment i'm going to press enter and

586
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,039
tap

587
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
and you'll see it starts to give me

588
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,520
additional selections or options but i'm

589
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,960
actually going to say hey i want you to

590
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,640
give me

591
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,679
some

592
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:30,480
some

593
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,240
other solutions so you'll notice it's

594
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,320
synthesizing a few different solutions

595
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,600
we'll see the result here in just a

596
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,480
moment

597
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,760
and boom

598
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,320
we see some solutions um so you start to

599
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,559
look through i i'm not a

600
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,080
super adept

601
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,600
rust programmer but you can see that it

602
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,840
gives me multiple options and functions

603
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,640
that could encrypt decrypt files

604
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,799
across the board so i just scroll

605
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,320
through find the one that i think fits

606
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,799
my use case uh in the best way and i

607
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:57,840
accept it

608
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,600
now i will note for anybody that

609
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,240
analyzes the code too uh closely i did

610
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,159
edit this video to take out uh some of

611
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,320
the malicious parts because personally i

612
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:09,120
didn't want to be responsible for uh uh

613
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,480
showing an example of of ransomware um

614
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,400
on the on the web so

615
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,679
i thought that was pretty unique i hope

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,520
you enjoyed that as well

617
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:18,400
so

618
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,159
last what we're going to talk about is

619
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,480
what can we do about it uh so what can

620
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,240
we do about artificial intelligence or

621
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,000
how can we use artificial intelligence

622
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,159
in our cyber security solutions um what

623
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,400
can we do about ransomware

624
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,039
number one we want to uh incorporate

625
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:35,679
some sort of robust endpoint protection

626
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
and we need detection and response so we

627
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:39,679
need something that's going to be a

628
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,919
preventive technology as well

629
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:43,360
and a good point to remember here on the

630
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,840
slide is endpoint is your security edge

631
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,200
you have to think you know whether it's

632
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,320
a mobile device or a desktop computer a

633
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,720
laptop whatever that is your security

634
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,640
edge you're no longer your security edge

635
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,559
is no longer the four walls

636
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,440
of a

637
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,320
of an office building or a data center

638
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,480
so let's dive into that a little bit now

639
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,679
i'm going to show you an example again

640
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,679
by checkpoint um one of the things that

641
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:07,679
we're using is uh behavioral detection

642
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,679
and automated remediation

643
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,080
so this is uh we hold many many patents

644
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,640
with our harmony endpoint solution um

645
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,240
but let's look at some of the some of

646
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:16,960
the

647
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,280
unique capabilities of it uh behavior

648
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,159
guard uh behavior guard has 900 actually

649
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,679
i think at this point in time it's it's

650
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
well over a thousand rolls built into it

651
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,720
it's a dynamic machine learning model

652
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,360
and it has full offline capabilities so

653
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,640
it doesn't need to be connected to the

654
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,559
internet or actively receiving you know

655
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,799
intelligence to uh to work because again

656
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,880
it's analyzing the behavior of the file

657
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,960
so what does it do very similar to a

658
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,880
sandboxing solution you know in a

659
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,960
sandboxing solution like i talked about

660
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,600
earlier uh with with cadet and huntress

661
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,000
and such is we take a file just like a

662
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,919
bomb and we explode it or see what it

663
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,919
does open it up and analyze that

664
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,120
behavior and collect all of the

665
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,720
indicators compromise and see if we

666
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
notice some sort of similarity to

667
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
something else

668
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
now what's really cool about this

669
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,280
solution behavior regard is essentially

670
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,120
the trigger it's what realizes hey

671
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
there's an infection or there's a

672
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,919
problem

673
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,240
now what it does is it actually

674
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
from there passes that uh that

675
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,679
information along that intelligence

676
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:15,440
along to our anti-ransomware

677
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,159
capabilities it says hey i've noticed

678
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:20,320
that um you know this executable that's

679
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,720
been launched is rapidly encrypting

680
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,200
files or it's setting up scheduled tasks

681
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
or it's modifying the you know the

682
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,840
registry um so what anti-ransomware is

683
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,520
actually doing in the background because

684
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,679
it's making shadow copies in real time

685
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
so every file that's being changed we're

686
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,280
making our own and i don't want to

687
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,039
confuse shadow copies with the the

688
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,880
microsoft version of shadow copies this

689
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,440
is uh our own solution um and we

690
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,960
actually make those shadow copies inside

691
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
of an encrypted quarantine a protected

692
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,919
um partition essentially of the of the

693
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:50,960
machine

694
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,000
now

695
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,679
now that we've realized again we've seen

696
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,200
ransomware on the machine we realize

697
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,520
this thing is rapidly encrypting files

698
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,760
we can use those shadow copies to do an

699
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,480
automatic restore um so

700
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,600
from there

701
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,080
um we will you know pop up and tell the

702
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,720
user hey we've detected ransomware uh

703
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,960
we're analyzing the infection we're

704
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,559
terminating the process we're cleaning

705
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,480
up the system and oh by the way we're

706
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,480
also gonna put all of your files back so

707
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,279
no worries um so this is very uh simply

708
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,679
displayed essentially you see a um you

709
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:23,360
know like a yellow spinning bar that

710
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
says we're analyzing and remediating and

711
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,679
then you see big green check mark so it

712
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,440
makes it very easy for your users to

713
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,360
realize that there's a problem

714
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,960
allow the automated solution to

715
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,440
remediate the problem and uh it doesn't

716
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,600
require any intervention by by

717
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,039
administrators

718
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,480
but in the background you're also going

719
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,080
to get a great forensics report that

720
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,400
we'll dive into in just a moment

721
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,520
and again all this is powered by ai uh

722
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,679
or artificial intelligence and i'm not

723
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,080
gonna read all of these obviously but uh

724
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,480
there's there's well over 60 ai and

725
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,320
traditional engines built into our

726
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,480
behavioral guard anti-ransomware and

727
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,840
forensics capabilities

728
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:04,640
so here's a brief example of what this

729
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,039
looks like you'll probably saw there for

730
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,320
just a moment that it was spinning it

731
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
said it's analyzing so it's collecting

732
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,559
all of the information about it and this

733
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:14,880
machine in this example here is fully

734
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,240
offline um so you saw that it was um you

735
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,760
know analyzing the infection it's

736
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,840
collecting all of the events and then it

737
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,960
completely clears the entire um uh

738
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
attack kill chain so it's gonna

739
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,080
completely clean and remediate the

740
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,840
situation and then it's going to do an

741
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,919
automatic file restoration or rollback

742
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,000
of the system and then in the background

743
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
for admins analysts et cetera you can

744
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,240
get you get to see the uh the forensics

745
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:41,240
report

746
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,000
so um moving on let's talk about

747
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,240
complete user protection what that means

748
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,400
um in in a few different ways

749
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
uh the most important part is thinking

750
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,400
about security holistically you need to

751
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
protect them not only on the endpoint

752
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
the network level but at the browser as

753
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,240
well uh you need to prevent you know

754
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,840
phishing attacks uh you need to be able

755
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,159
to do content disarm in um in

756
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:06,799
reconstruction so maybe you actually

757
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,200
want to you know sanitize a file

758
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,039
there's a very unique way of doing that

759
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:12,400
that we use here at checkpoint called

760
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,799
thread extraction which is where we

761
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,960
fully sanitize a file as it's coming in

762
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,799
so think of downloading you know a

763
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,600
microsoft word document or a pdf

764
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,279
they don't necessarily need active

765
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
content inside of you know visual basic

766
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,679
is a very power or i'm sorry visual

767
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,200
basic for applications it's a very

768
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,000
powerful uh scripting language however

769
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,520
not all word documents and excel

770
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
documents and and such need that to be

771
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,159
embedded uh there's there's you know

772
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:40,000
some limited use cases but for the most

773
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,760
part it doesn't need to be there so we

774
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,679
go ahead and extract that we completely

775
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,360
pull it out and we give the user the

776
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
sanitized document this is a document

777
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,200
that can't do any harm because there's

778
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,679
zero active content inside of it

779
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,080
we also use sandboxing technologies to

780
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,520
analyze the file which we talked about

781
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,200
earlier

782
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,360
um so it's really important um when you

783
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,440
think about endpoint protection uh think

784
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
about something that's a single agent

785
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,159
you know we're all well aware of kind of

786
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:07,600
a sprawl that's been happening on our

787
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,840
task bars over time you know some people

788
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,480
have seen you know go in and do a uh an

789
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,159
analysis or an assessment of their

790
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,320
environment and i'll see three four five

791
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,720
even six uh security solutions on one

792
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,399
endpoint you know that's rough on system

793
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,320
resources but it's also

794
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,399
that's pretty difficult to manage uh so

795
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,760
think about something that is

796
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,440
consolidated with all the protections

797
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,159
that you need uh here are just a few

798
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,159
and make sure that it is unified when it

799
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,760
comes to management i don't like to use

800
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,120
the word single pane of glass because i

801
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,440
think it's been overused these days um

802
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,760
but again think about like things like

803
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,760
full disc encryption um you know

804
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,320
protecting usb uh devices like flash

805
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,159
drives and such but uh by encrypting

806
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
them doing some port protection to

807
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,000
prevent unauthorized usb devices from

808
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,360
being plugged in

809
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,600
think about your vpn your

810
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:55,679
next generation you know antivirus

811
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
solutions so anti-malware machine

812
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,480
learning anti-exploit etc all of these

813
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,399
capabilities you want them inside of one

814
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,399
agent that's easy to manage

815
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,559
so again this is just an overview of a

816
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:07,919
lot of the productions that you should

817
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,640
incorporate inside of your environments

818
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,679
to protect yourself against ransomware

819
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,480
um so diving a little bit deeper into

820
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,240
the fishing piece i thought it was would

821
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,679
be interesting to cover because that's

822
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,440
often how ransomware gets deployed in

823
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:25,279
the first place or finds its entry point

824
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,840
into an environment um you know

825
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,240
incorporate something that is able to

826
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,080
you know automatically uh prevent a uh a

827
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,000
phishing attack so you'll see here you

828
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,840
know user might have clicked on this uh

829
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,440
malicious phishing site they think it's

830
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
salesforce.com they enter their

831
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,159
credentials

832
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:43,919
but actually in the background what's

833
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:46,000
happening is our endpoint is using our

834
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
threat cloud um in all of those machine

835
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,480
learning and ai uh capabilities to look

836
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,080
for things uh that might um you know

837
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:56,320
make it realize or or come to a verdict

838
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,159
that this has actually been a deceptive

839
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:00,480
site so in this example we saw visual

840
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,600
similarity and url similarity between

841
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,240
the two pages uh from a real site and a

842
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,080
uh the site that we were analyzing and

843
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,840
realized that this was not correct you

844
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:13,120
know it was um potentially you know

845
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
reaching out to the wrong domain or or

846
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,279
it was hitting an ip address that was

847
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:19,520
known to be malicious there's a lot of

848
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,440
unique and you saw all the ai engines

849
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,480
earlier uh a lot of unique engines that

850
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,480
are at play here to analyze this in real

851
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,360
time

852
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,039
and prevent the user from you know

853
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:32,559
potentially making a big mistake

854
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,520
looking at um web browsing as well

855
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,840
so more examples you know blocking uh

856
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,000
links analyzing you know web downloads

857
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,679
and preventing anything that could be

858
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,080
potentially malicious or is malicious so

859
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,720
we can do real-time sandboxing um and

860
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,080
we'll we'll move through these a little

861
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,919
bit quicker here um

862
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,480
but we can look at malicious uh email

863
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,559
attachments we can we can block it based

864
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,039
off of that sandboxing analysis um we

865
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:00,799
can look at fileless attacks as well to

866
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,320
make sure you know that we can actually

867
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,080
block those and prevent those on the

868
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,399
endpoint themselves um a couple other

869
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,799
examples you see down below malicious

870
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,960
files on usbs those are those are

871
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,200
analyzed as well just like antivirus has

872
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,720
been doing for years however we've

873
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,399
introduced more than just traditional

874
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,000
static analysis

875
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,840
and then of course malicious mobile

876
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,200
applications so last we'll talk about

877
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,000
forensics and how you respond uh to an

878
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,480
attack or to a potential attack that was

879
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,159
attempted

880
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,720
so looking at a forensics report here um

881
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:33,919
there's gonna be a lot of information so

882
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:35,679
i'm gonna walk you through this so first

883
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,600
we want to look at how to triage an

884
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:38,559
attack

885
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:41,039
so as the slide points out should i

886
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,520
panic uh so we'll look at the attack

887
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,440
itself and understand okay

888
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,600
we see that this was part of the maze

889
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,360
malware family we see that it is

890
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,279
considered a critical severity however

891
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,520
it's been cleaned uh so no you don't

892
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,679
need to panic uh we can move on down and

893
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:56,880
look at the attack elements and

894
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,960
understand okay um

895
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,640
you know what happened here what were

896
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,799
the uh connections or the processes that

897
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:05,360
were involved so we see that it was a

898
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,960
remote login of some sort and there was

899
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,799
a malicious process

900
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,159
moving further down we looked at the

901
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,240
type of attack it was we see that this

902
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
had multiple classifications

903
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,240
it was a bot it had some invasion

904
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,720
techniques there was ransomware included

905
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,760
as well as potentially a trojan for for

906
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:24,320
future use

907
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,080
moving on we can see what the business

908
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,159
impact was or what it potentially could

909
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,880
have been so you know 92 pieces of data

910
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:32,880
or files that were

911
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,360
would have been held at ransom

912
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
we can also see in fact how it got in uh

913
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,519
so we can see that somebody was logged

914
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:43,039
in via a remote desktop and then they

915
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
opened uh the chrome executable so they

916
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,640
were browsing on the web and found this

917
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,559
file and that's how it made it down to

918
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:50,559
the actual device itself

919
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,000
and then we can see you know kind of

920
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,320
last you know is it completely cleaned

921
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,039
have we you know solved the issue itself

922
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,919
um so we'll see here that you know two

923
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,559
processes were terminated completely

924
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,240
and in a good deal of files were

925
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
quarantined or deleted that were um you

926
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
know impacted or part of the attack

927
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,240
itself so it could have been files that

928
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,880
the uh the malware was creating itself

929
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,960
and then you can see last on that third

930
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:16,720
kind of circle there that we have

931
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
achieved a 100 clean score or uh or

932
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,840
restoration so all of those files have

933
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,960
been fully uh restored for the user um

934
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,480
and then you get a nice minor attack

935
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,880
framework below to to kind of triage

936
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,200
further and understand okay uh let's

937
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,200
look at some of the indicators uh that

938
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,000
were

939
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:34,960
um

940
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,240
that were uh

941
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:38,640
detected and and you know later on the

942
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,880
malware is prevented but this is the

943
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,320
information that our machine learning

944
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,919
and behavioral analysis is actually

945
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:45,919
feeding into the engine to indicate yes

946
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,760
this was in fact a ransomware attack

947
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:51,600
so lastly i will leave you with best

948
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,320
practices um so overall um you know kind

949
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,840
of the three themes here you want to

950
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,720
reduce your risk um you know things like

951
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
uh multi-factor uh authentication you

952
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,919
know phishing prevention um user aware

953
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:06,559
awareness and red team exercises

954
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,320
you also want to limit the impact uh

955
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,880
segmentation is key operations

956
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:13,360
operational technology and you know i t

957
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,440
should be completely segmented uh

958
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,559
appropriately use logical zones um and

959
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,480
then have manual control workarounds

960
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,640
things that are are part of your

961
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
disaster recovery and business

962
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,080
continuity

963
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,480
plan and then of course manage response

964
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,960
have a very clearly communicated

965
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,720
incident response plan

966
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,880
and make sure that everyone understands

967
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,279
of that plan what do they own and who

968
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,039
should they be communicating with and

969
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,440
then of course quarantine any asset that

970
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,640
uh

971
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,480
that is suspected to have ransomware or

972
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,760
some sort of malware on it

973
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,240
so i want to thank everyone for your

974
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,480
time please feel free to post any

975
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,080
questions that you might have or if

976
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,919
something comes up afterwards uh please

977
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,000
feel free to reach out to me i've posted

978
