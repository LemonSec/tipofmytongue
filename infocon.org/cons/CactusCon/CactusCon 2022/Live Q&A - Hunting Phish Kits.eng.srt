1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,760
and in the whole point of the talk

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,880
really is all around um trying to

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:05,839
push

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,600
uh people to say hey

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,760
we have to actually sell this ourselves

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,280
you know

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,920
yeah let's get outside

8
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,239
if uh

9
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,080
uh hopefully we got we've got some

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,400
people transferred over correct

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,640
but yeah thanks so much for the talk

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,279
and yep

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,240
it's it's

14
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,879
how do you

15
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,160
you were kind of chopping there

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,000
um i think you said

17
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,640
how do you operationalize some of this

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,960
um

19
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,640
yeah so like

20
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,799
you know you you first you

21
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:09,600
um you just gotta start small right like

22
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,600
start small just try to automate or at

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
least you know have if you don't have a

24
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,000
way to centralize you know where you're

25
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,159
reporting messages or or even the

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,119
ability to do that um you know first

27
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,040
going to stop you start there and then

28
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,040
you build upon it you know you have them

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,200
in a central location you have a process

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
kind of uh down and then you start

31
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:33,040
getting into um actually you know

32
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,720
automating the the extraction of

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,520
indicators and inspecting a header

34
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,360
inspection of headers and so on and so

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,280
forth in your environment

36
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,200
at that point if you're you're good with

37
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,240
there you know stopping it is one thing

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,720
um going beyond that where you're

39
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
actually trying to gather that intel is

40
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,119
where that next phase is and and that's

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,399
where you want to get to

42
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,040
um a lot of people aren't um

43
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,920
a lot of organizations are don't even uh

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,759
don't even have like a way to report

45
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,320
messages or or or do anything with those

46
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
messages once they're reported so

47
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,119
but if you do um you know go out there

48
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,878
and gather that evidence as much as

49
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,560
possible uh it's gonna help you kind of

50
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,520
prepare

51
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,080
um going forward as well as you know who

52
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,319
is attacking you and in general and kind

53
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,000
of understanding their motives and their

54
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
tactics

55
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
yeah i think i think that's critical you

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,800
know just kind of

57
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
moving through it and kind of iterating

58
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,720
as you learn

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,000
as you as you grow i started back

60
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,080
many many years ago probably six seven

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,000
years ago now um where people didn't

62
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,519
really give a [ __ ] about fishing and

63
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:08,720
sorry for the language they did they

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,120
didn't really care about it so um you

65
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,800
know trying to fight that uphill battle

66
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,000
where you were getting ten thousand

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,040
fishing emails you know a month um

68
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,040
and no one gave a [ __ ] because we had so

69
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
many other things like it's an uphill

70
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,879
battle but i think now it is way more uh

71
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,519
accessible and we're we're

72
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,760
more i think leadership in general is

73
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,319
more aware and they're like yeah go do

74
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,519
it you know and they're not going to

75
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,239
hold you back so um i think starting to

76
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,560
automate little by little is is key for

77
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,720
sure

78
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
yeah and i i think you know it's it's

79
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,680
still a uh

80
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,760
it's still going to be a primary

81
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,319
infection vector for years to come so

82
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,920
people got to take it seriously and

83
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,840
hopefully they they they listen but uh

84
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
thanks so much for for giving us a sort

85
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,879
