00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,560
elle woods who here

45
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,880

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,720
thought about doing this talk and this

48
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,560
is you know this is a chick flick okay

49
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,399
legally blonde is the movie that el

50
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
woods is from and i'm like you know

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,399
predominantly in this industry male

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,000
audience i'm like will this resonate

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,640
with them and i started asking my male

54
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,159
colleagues have you seen legally blonde

55
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,759
have you seen this movie and almost

56
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:02,079
every single one of them said yes

57
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,560
so i really hope that you enjoy this

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,200
talk as much of as i've enjoyed the

59
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,440
movie legally blonde now you might be

60
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,840
thinking i'm obviously not blonde and

61
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,319
i'm not decked out in pink so what

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
possibly could i have in common and what

63
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,840
could forensics possibly have in common

64
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,080
with elle woods and legally blonde and

65
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,319
we're going to find that out so a little

66
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,400

as an attendee i want to say almost five

70
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,680
years ago and i have just seen it grow

71
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,879
and grow and grow and i have been so

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,360
impressed with the community here with

73
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,599
the people that helped put on the

74
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,560
conference the kids track is amazing one

75
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,040
of the first conferences that i have

76
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,000

that's kind of what i do with my spare

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,000
time

90
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,720
right now i am an associate managing

91
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,519

at kroll i lead a team of investigators

93
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,760
through various breach cases so right

94
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,159
now as i'm sure everybody is aware

95
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,440
ransomware is just exploding out there

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,159
especially with so many companies

97
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,879
transitioning to a remote workforce

98
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,640
we're just getting hit with a ton of

99
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,239
these cases but we do

100
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,400
everything as it relates to computers

101
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,439
you know network intrusions apt we help

102
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,920
litigation support all sorts of things

103
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,879
and i got my start out in forensics

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
right in a small firm right in tucson

105
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,760
that was ran by a woman out there and

106
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,360
then have just kind of grown throughout

107
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,280
the industry and just i have just loved

108
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,399
it so much okay so who is elle woods if

109
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,478
you have not seen the movie legally

110
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,358
blonde she is the protagonist in this

111
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,320
movie

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,639
and her journey begins when her

113
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,120
boyfriend breaks up with her because he

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,520
needs someone more serious than elle

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
woods

116
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,680
what's interesting is this is actually

117
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,919
based on a real life character that was

118
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
born and raised right here in phoenix

119
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,400
arizona amanda brown in the 1970s

120
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
and it is kind of her journey as she

121
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,720
went through stanford law school and you

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,400
know the first time i saw this movie i

123
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,479
loved it and i don't watch a lot of

124
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
movies more than once but this is one

125
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,440
that i always found myself you know

126
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,280
every time i watched it i enjoyed it and

127
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,759
i felt like i really related to this

128
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,479
character and i began questioning why do

129
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,440
i relate to her and why do i enjoy you

130
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,199
know this kind of frilly little chick

131
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:11,600
flick so much

132
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,240
and i began to realize as i watched it

133
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
there are a lot of overall life lessons

134
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,639
in this and i really saw how it ties

135
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,280
into our industry here just not

136
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,680
forensics but the cyber security

137
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,520
industry as well now one of the first

138
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,560
things i picked up on was embracing

139
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,680
change

140
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
i did not set out on the path to be in

141
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,080
digital forensics and incident response

142
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,759
when i went to school

143
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,080
way way back when they pretty much just

144
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,840
had two degrees a computer science

145
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,880
degree and an infosec degree so i

146
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,039
started out my career originally

147
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,720
thinking i was going to be actually

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,280
doing civil engineering

149
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,680
i started out doing civil engineering i

150
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,360
started working in a firm doing civil

151
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,080
engineering and i realized it just

152
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
wasn't the right path for me and way way

153
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,080
back in the third grade my dad brought

154
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,960
home an apple two plus does anybody here

155
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,120
work with remember the apple ii plus

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,880
okay a couple people do

157
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
yeah so a long long time ago and i

158
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,039
really loved it even back then i started

159
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,039
programming in basic just having a blast

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,039
with it you know i thought i wanted to

161
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
go down this path of being a civil

162
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,039
engineer and it just it just wasn't

163
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,240
really you know i wasn't excited by it

164
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
and i remembered how much i enjoyed

165
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,280
computers and i made that switch into

166
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,000
computer science now i also have

167
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,680
throughout my career a lot of people

168
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,880
come to me

169
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,440
that are looking to make a career change

170
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,120
they've found the field they attend

171
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
conferences like this they're like wow

172
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,360
cyber security this is really cool pen

173
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,520
testing forensics i really want to get

174
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,560
into this how can i make that change in

175
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,000
my career and how can i transition over

176
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,160
from being a cis admin into something

177
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,440
like the cyber security field so i see

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,919
in our field a lot of change that is

179
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,840
always happening people are even

180
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,720
changing verticals within the industry

181
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,720
from pen testing they go from blue team

182
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,199
to red team to purple team

183
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,440
and with elle woods she made this

184
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
decision to go to harvard she's going to

185
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,759
get serious and she is going to get her

186
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,599
man back by going to harvard and so she

187
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,000
set her sights on this goal and once she

188
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,039
decided this is what she wanted to do

189
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,400
she embraced

190
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,360
that change she found out what it was

191
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,759
that she had to do to make that happen

192
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:40,000
and to piggyback upon that

193
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,960
once you see that change coming once it

194
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,560
is that you know

195
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,560
what it is that you want to do and

196
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,680
you've embraced that change you have to

197
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,759
put in the time people aren't just going

198
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
to come knock up on your door and say

199
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
like hey i heard you wanted to do pen

200
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,199
testing come work with us

201
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:59,759
you need to attend these conferences you

202
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:00,879
need to

203
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:04,400
put in the time to make this change

204
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,639
happen whatever it may be in your life

205
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,639
whether it is now you're working

206
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,800
remotely and the kids are at home with

207
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,520
you all day while you're working maybe

208
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,960
you're used to being in an office and

209
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,639
socializing and now you're all of a

210
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,360
sudden in a different environment or

211
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,120
you've done that career change and

212
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,160
you're kind of in an uncomfortable place

213
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,160
you need to embrace that and you need to

214
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,879
put in the time to make this a positive

215
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,840
change in your life so for me

216
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,479
when i first started out in forensics it

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,599
was this small company out in tucson and

218
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,919
the woman that hired me was actually out

219
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,839
of the office the first week i was there

220
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
she was out testifying on a big

221
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
important case so i came into the office

222
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,760
i sat down at my desk and i'm like hmm

223
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
like

224
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,600
what do i do now i actually found the

225
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,399
job

226
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
listing and craigslist they were looking

227
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,720
for a computer forensic associate

228
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:02,000
i had no idea 10 years ago

229
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,080
what this was so i show up in the office

230
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
the first day i sit down and the other

231
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,880
gal in the office said well there's this

232
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,200
program called encase that we use and so

233
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,720
i took out the manual and i started

234
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,080
flipping through the manual i'm like oh

235
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,320
my gosh you can recover deleted files

236
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,040
like i didn't know you could do this and

237
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,920
next thing i know i'm on amazon and i'm

238
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,480
searching for books to learn more and

239
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,480
more about this you know this is a small

240
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,640
company they're not going to send me off

241
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,320
you know to

242
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,320
a thousand dollar training course to

243
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,320
learn about it this is going to be on

244
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,839
the job training so what can i do myself

245
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:40,160
to help learn more about this field that

246
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,399
i found that i'm so excited to get into

247
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,120
so books are a great way to learn about

248
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,880
this and you know this is one of those

249
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
things where you really go oh my gosh am

250
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,399
i getting that old

251
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,720
i went into amazon and i searched to see

252
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,160
okay when was the first book that i

253
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,959
bought and it was actually back in 2010

254
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,519
and it was so old that the book still

255
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
came with dvds so i'm pretty sure i

256
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,880
still have this on my shelf with the dvd

257
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,279
in there of course now books you know

258
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,519
you can go into github and you can

259
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,120
download the contents from there but i

260
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,160
just kind of had to chuckle uh dvd but

261
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
we all learn in different ways i am a

262
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
book person i love to have books i love

263
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,120
to have that physical touch i love to be

264
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,360
flipping through the pages of it

265
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,560
some people respond really well to blogs

266
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,040
and podcasts the nice thing about this

267
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,040
is you know if you're a busy person and

268
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,399
you're trying to fit everything into

269
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,839
your life you know you can pop on a

270
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:35,440
podcast while you're working out at the

271
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,279
gym

272
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,600
and these blog posts are ones that i

273
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,920
have found have been really helpful this

274
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,880
week in forensics basically highlights

275
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,959
everything that has gone on in the

276
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,120
industry over the last week as it

277
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,399
relates to blog posts or as it relates

278
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:55,440
to podcasts it has things about malware

279
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,360
and vulnerabilities and everything in

280
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,040
that space so at the end of the week

281
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,279
i'll sit down i'll scroll through there

282
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
and see what it is that i need to get

283
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,399
caught up on

284
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,399
windows incident response i've been

285
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
fortunate enough to have been a tech

286
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,959
editor with harlan carvey on two of his

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,519
books and this is his blog post and i

288
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:15,920
love it because not only does he have

289
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,320
in-depth deep technical dives on

290
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
information but he also has some great

291
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,760
i'm going to throw out one of these

292
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
terms thought leadership right

293
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,720
some great thought leadership on some of

294
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,200
the things going on in the industry and

295
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,440
about dfir has

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,240
information about ctf events discord

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,320
servers different resources are out

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,560
there they have places where you can go

299
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,200
look for jobs in the industry

300
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,200
over here for my podcast here's a brand

301
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,120
new one by mark johnson that came out

302
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,519
recently at the bottom the sans daily

303
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,560
stormcast like five to ten minute bites

304
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
about what's going on in the industry so

305
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,560
when we talk about books it takes a

306
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,000
while for a book to make it out in the

307
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,279
bookshelf you know i went through the

308
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,600
process twice with harlan you have the

309
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,360
editing period where they're writing it

310
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
their deadlines and then it goes off to

311
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,880
be published

312
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,680
here you get the latest and the greatest

313
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,200
information

314
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,440
readily available for you

315
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,240
there's also twitter now i'll have to be

316
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,160
honest uh when covet kicked off for me i

317
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
just couldn't look at twitter anymore it

318
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
was a little bit overwhelming for me so

319
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,720
if you go look at my twitter you'll see

320
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,560
it's it's kind of dead right now just

321
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:28,320
because i kind of had to separate myself

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,079
from that but

323
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,800
that is what is great from our industry

324
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,360
is that there are so many different ways

325
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,920
that we can go out and we can obtain

326
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,000
information about it readily you know

327
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,320
you go check the hashtag dfir you can go

328
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,800
check the hashtag for cactuscon or if

329
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,639
you're at any other conference you can

330
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,959
see who to follow on there whose style

331
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,839

332
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,600
are amazing at sharing what it is that

333
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,600
they've found and the latest research

334
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:58,880
they've done

335
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,760
and it's a great place to go look

336
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,600
okay discord we are using discord right

337
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,079
now for this conference and i have seen

338
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,079
discord leveraged in ways that i didn't

339
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,079
even know it could be used especially

340
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,920
when covet hit when it comes to

341
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,040
conferences being there being able to

342
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,519
network with people things that are

343
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,240
related specifically to the industry and

344
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:24,160
what's nice about these discord servers

345
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,399
is sometimes they can be totally public

346
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,120
and open and everybody can come in or

347
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,560
you can kind of have them a little bit

348
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,079
more locked down where you have an

349
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,560
authentication to get into that server

350
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,000
so for instance in the dfir discord

351
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,279
server you know you have to tell a

352
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,120
little bit about yourself we have people

353
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,440
that are law enforcement in there um we

354
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
have people that are in the private

355
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,079
sector we have students in there so i

356
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,360
think there's well over a thousand

357
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,120
people that are in this discord server

358
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,160
now so this is a wealth of information

359
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,120
for you to tap into make connections

360
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,199
learn see what else is going on and i've

361
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,760
seen entire ctf events being run

362
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,279
basically out of a discord server okay

363
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,440
i know this may be difficult to believe

364
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,600
but believe it or not sometimes in this

365
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,760
industry you will run into people with

366
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,959
egos i know it's hard okay

367
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,680
l woods this happened to l woods too

368
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,880
okay she's sitting out on the lawn right

369
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,839
and they're going through their

370
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,279
introductory day and you can see right

371
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,120
here she's got on her pink and she's

372
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
being bubbly and they're getting

373
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,320
introduced to all the students at

374
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,320
harvard and they go around the circle

375
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,880
and someone's like i have a masters and

376
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,199
over here it's like i have a phd and i

377
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,440
helped kids in somalia over the summer

378
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,279
while i worked on my third district you

379
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,120
know dissertation

380
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,399
and elle woods she got into harvard she

381
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,360
took the lsats she deserves a seat at

382
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
that table just like everybody else

383
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
right there but they're going around

384
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,040
they're fluffing you know they're

385
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,120
fluffing their egos they're preening

386
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,600
themselves they're you know

387
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
in this industry it is not uncommon to

388
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,279
run into these type of people

389
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,399
unfortunately but the thing is you know

390
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,880
everybody that's here like

391
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,880
you are here you are doing the work

392
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:12,880
you're gaining that knowledge you have

393
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,600
every single right to be at that table

394
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,320
along with everybody else no matter what

395
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,920
it is that your background is it doesn't

396
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,160
matter don't pay attention to that

397
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,160
that's just the background noise you

398
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,839
know yes we have to work with these

399
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,680
people but you know there have been a

400
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,240
lot of times where um i will show up

401
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
somewhere and has anybody heard of the

402
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,079
game like stump the chump

403
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:38,639
as the consultant this happens sometime

404
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,720
you show up on site and they immediately

405
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,560
start throwing questions at you left and

406
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,880
right left and right to see you know do

407
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
you deserve to be here do you do you

408
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
know what you're doing you know do you

409
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,360
have the right to be here and we just

410
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,120
have to set this aside sometimes we're

411
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,199
just going to ignore those egos we're

412
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,440
just going to keep on moving forward we

413
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,600
know that we deserve to be here we know

414
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,600
our stuff and we're going to get the job

415
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,880
done

416
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,680
okay

417
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,800
the other thing is that we need to use

418
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,360
the tools that we need to use how many

419
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:12,639
people here um okay and i'm i am a linux

420
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,880
person but i am not a linux person okay

421
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
so there are two editors in linux that

422
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
are pretty popular what are those two

423
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,240
editors

424
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,959
right okay maybe nano right there are

425
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,399
people out there

426
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,720
that you know will die on that mountain

427
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,759
top for their editor right you need to

428
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,240
use this tool you have to use this tool

429
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,199
you should not be using that tool

430
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:38,800
don't you know this tool does this and

431
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,680
your tool doesn't do that you know what

432
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,279
at the end of the day

433
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,320
use the tool that you want to do to get

434
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,399
your job done

435
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,240
okay everybody has their favorite tools

436
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,680
and it's kind of fun to goof around

437
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:54,720
about them and talk about them

438
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,519
and argue about them but don't let that

439
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,759
gatekeeping happen a lot of times in the

440
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,000
forensic industry we will have people

441
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,519
reach out and say like you should really

442
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,359
be using this latest tool to do this

443
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,959
this other tool doesn't parse this

444
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,160
information

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,160
this is the best text editor out there

446
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,640
you shouldn't be using this text editor

447
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,319
but we all see

448
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,359
visualize and work differently a tool

449
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:18,640
that works

450
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,039
great for me may not work well for

451
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,760
somebody else that's why we have choices

452
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,679
out there that's why we have multiple

453
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:26,720
tools

454
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,320
available to us to do our work so don't

455
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,880
ever be bullied out of using a tool that

456
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,120
you like to do because other people in

457
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,640
the industry are saying that you

458
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,720
shouldn't be using it now that doesn't

459
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
come without some caveats which i'll go

460
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
over in a minute here

461
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
but just keep that in mind here we have

462
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,919
l woods and you can see does anybody

463
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:47,600
know the model of this it's from the

464
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,520
early 2000s yeah right it's a i i

465
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
googled it it's an ibook orange um

466
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,799
it cost about fifteen hundred dollars

467
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,919
back then and worth about 25 and 25

468
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:01,840
dollars today well you know what that

469
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,360
was about um

470
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,520
that was 2020. so with covet it's

471
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,120
probably worth even more now right

472
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,639
because uh inflation

473
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,000
so use those tools but there are some

474
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,520
things we have to keep in mind when we

475
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,679
use tools in our industry and this

476
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,679
applies whether you're doing forensics

477
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,440
whether you're doing pen testing

478
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,480
it's for all tools across the board

479
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:31,760
we need to apply this concept of trust

480
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,320
but verify sure i can use tool a

481
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,600
over tool b as long as i know and i

482
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,440
understand

483
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,120
what the differences are between the

484
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:46,080
tools what a tool might be missing and

485
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,320
what its shortcomings are

486
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,200
so this concept of trust but verify

487
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,679
i work the case so in forensics we have

488
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,600
something called an mft that's on a

489
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
windows system and it's called the

490
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,960
master file table it keeps track of all

491
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,200
the files and folders on the system it

492
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,360
has multiple timestamps and when a file

493
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,600
gets deleted there's simply a flag in

494
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,400
the mft that gets tripped to let the

495
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,240
operating system know the file's been

496
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:14,960
deleted but that record still exists in

497
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,600
the mft so we can recover information

498
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,520
about that deleted file

499
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,640
and i was using kind of a de facto

500
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,240
standard tool in the industry to parse

501
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,720
out that mft record and i noticed

502
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,240
something was a little bit off i was

503
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
working a case in the malware typically

504
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,799
showed up in a program directory c

505
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,360
program data mozilla and then our

506
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,520
malware was right there i had parsed

507
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
down an mft record and it was showing

508
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,640
that the file existed like underneath c

509
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,880
program files scooter software i'm like

510
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,799
wait a minute that's not what i've seen

511
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,280
across the board on the rest of my case

512
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,919
what's going on and it turned out that

513
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:57,840
the tool was incorrectly parsing out

514
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,160
deleted records and giving false

515
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,320
information about them and this is a

516
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
tool unfortunately that was kind of the

517
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,960
industry standard tool that everybody

518
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,840
was using to parse out the mft records

519
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,159
so when we talk about different ways to

520
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,240
validate our tools there's a method

521
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,840
called dual tool validation so that

522
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,440
means we're going to use two different

523
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,960
tools to parse over the data and each of

524
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,919
those tools should have the same result

525
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,960
now the downside of this is believe it

526
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,880
or not both tools

527
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,280
can be wrong so take for instance a new

528
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,039
browser that's released out in the

529
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,080
industry

530
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,240
maybe they add in a new column to the

531
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,960
database and the new tools don't support

532
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,919
that new column both tools will parse

533
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,480
out the information but both tools are

534
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,360
going to miss that new column because

535
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,240
they have not been updated yet at this

536
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,480
point in time

537
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,240
another way that we can validate our

538
00:20:56,240 --> 00:21:00,000
data is to use a known data set so we

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
can go in and we can do that browsing

540
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,159
and we can record the activity that

541
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,159
we're doing and then we can use a tool

542
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,520
to parse over and we know that tool

543
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,440
what it should be showing us because

544
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,720
we've created that data set the other

545
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,559
thing is we can go in and actually use

546
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,039
something like a hex viewer we can go in

547
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,640
and we can look at the raw data itself

548
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,120
without even using a tool to parse

549
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,880
through it so when we start talking

550
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,840
about

551
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,919
internet history and looking at internet

552
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,400
history in a forensic manner we can

553
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,039
bypass the tool completely and use

554
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:37,679
something like an sqlite browser to pop

555
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,480
open that database to take a look at it

556
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,159
to make sure that our tools are grabbing

557
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
all of the information that we need to

558
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,760
so you should always be

559
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,280
validating your tools the native

560
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,039
program's kind of what i just mentioned

561
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,840
i'm using an sql browser to open it up

562
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,880
and to take a look at it i had a case

563
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,200
where it was

564
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,440
what's the free email client by mozilla

565
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,559
thunderbird

566
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,120
it was a thunderbird case and

567
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,840
i had an email profile that was about 20

568
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,120
gigs in size and i used a program to

569
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,640
parse it out and i think it gave me like

570
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
20 emails and i was like wait a minute

571
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
this is a 20 gig folder there's no way

572
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,280
there's like five or six emails or 15

573
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,960
emails i would expect

574
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,240
thousands of emails so i ended up using

575
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,520
just the actual email client to open up

576
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,760
that profile and once i did it parsed

577
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,919
through everything correctly because it

578
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,039
is the native program that is used for

579
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,039
that now what i ended up doing is i

580
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,520
actually went in and wrote my own parser

581
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,640
because what i found was that it kept

582
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,360
all of the emails in a flat text file

583
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,240
whether they were deleted or not so when

584
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,480
the email client was used it did not

585
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:52,240
open up all those deleted ones because

586
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,480
it looked at a flag in a database the

587
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,400
database told it hey these emails are

588
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,640
deleted so it just skipped over them but

589
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
all of those emails were still sitting

590
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,080
right there in the text file so i just

591
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,919
wrote a little python parser that went

592
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,600
through it ignored the flag and it

593
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,000
recovered everything from it the other

594
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,520
thing that was interesting was with this

595
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,200
mailbox

596
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,720
in kind of like the unix world there's

597
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,360
something called an mbox format that was

598
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,679
what a lot of the parsing programs

599
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:18,480
thought

600
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,559
this file format was but it was actually

601
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,559
something called mbox rd and the

602
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,159
difference was the difference between

603
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,400
like a return and a new line very

604
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,080
nuanced but if you don't write your

605
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,799
parser correctly it's going it ended up

606
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,280
missing a lot of those emails

607
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:36,240
okay the other thing that is very

608
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,440
important

609
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,000
is finding a mentor

610
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,880
now in elwood situation she had a law

611
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,720
professor that she worked with that kind

612
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,679
of watched her as she grew in her

613
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:48,640
journey

614
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,039
going through law school and

615
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:54,080
there came a turning point for elle

616
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
she was getting ready to throw in the

617
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,840
town if you've seen the movie she had

618
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,679
won this internship

619
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,080
and her law professor hit on her and she

620
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,159
was very discouraged and she was going

621
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,799
to quit and she was going to leave and

622
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,640
one of her professors gave her some

623
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,960
really strong words of encouragement and

624
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,600
because of that she decided to continue

625
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,799
on her path and stay forward in this

626
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,279
industry i think mentors are really

627
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,880
important and i've been fortunate to

628
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,039
have a couple throughout my journey

629
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,360
this doesn't always have to be an

630
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,360
established relationship you know where

631
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
you knock on someone's door or you call

632
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,200
them up on the phone and ask them to be

633
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,760
the mentor sometimes it just happens

634
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,159
organically when i was making my

635
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:39,919
transition from

636
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,200
the

637
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,880
defense side of things where i was

638
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,039
working murder cases and child

639
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,440
pornography cases i kind of transitioned

640
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,480
into

641
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,640
digital forensics and incident response

642
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:53,120
and this was a new area for me so

643
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,360
someone took me underneath their wing

644
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
and guided me and showed me how to

645
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,120
navigate those waters and they're things

646
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,679
that you can't always learn in school i

647
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
remember the first time i went on site

648
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,440
to a client

649
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:07,440
to help them with an incident

650
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,679
and they wanted updates they had a

651
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:11,360
meeting in the morning they had one at

652
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,880
lunch and then they had another one

653
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,919
again in the evening and he told me look

654
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,600
we're going to these images to take a

655
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,640
look at we're going to start our

656
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,320
analysis and we tend to find things

657
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:22,400
pretty quickly off the bat but what we

658
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,760
want to do

659
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,440
we want to hold on to some of that

660
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,120
information and we don't want to share

661
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,960
with them every single little thing that

662
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,039
we found that way when we hit the noon

663
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
meeting two hours later we can dole out

664
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,039
a little bit more information and then

665
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,880
in the evening we can dole out a little

666
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,039
bit of information so we you know we're

667
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,559
providing value that didn't mean we were

668
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,000
sitting in the conference room you know

669
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,440
twiddling our thumbs the whole time not

670
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,679
doing anything but you know you want to

671
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,039
be able to have that information to

672
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,559
share with the client show them that

673
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:49,760
you're working that you're making

674
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,039
progress

675
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,720
you know give them something to take

676
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
action on to keep them busy so that you

677
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,279
can focus on what you need to do while

678
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:59,360
you're on site so these are the type of

679
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
things that a mentor can help you with

680
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,240
the other thing i think we really need

681
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,559
to start doing in this industry is we

682
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,000
really need to start talking about

683
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,559
salaries i don't know if

684
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,919
you know people have gone on to

685
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,400
glassdoor to try and figure out what you

686
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
should be asking for in our market but

687
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,720
it is very hard because of what we do

688
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,720
you know i find these generic job

689
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,880
descriptions you know cyber security

690
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,159
expert well what does that mean does

691
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:25,520
that mean you're a pen tester does that

692
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
mean you do digital forensics does that

693
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,200
mean that you do malware analysis like

694
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,440
how am i supposed to know how much to go

695
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:34,240
in and ask for a job if i don't have a

696
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,960
way to compare salaries and of course

697
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
you know the thought is that a lot of

698
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,720
companies don't want you discussing

699
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,360
discussing this information so finding

700
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,880
mentors and meeting those contacts out

701
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,960
at conferences like this having those

702
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,840
conversations people you can confide in

703
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,000
and ask that are in your same job

704
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,600
vertical or the one that you might want

705
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,720
to make a move to so you know what your

706
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
value and your worth is and where you

707
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,679
should begin those salary negotiations i

708
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:04,559
think

709
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,799
is very very important there are also

710
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,960
organizations out there that can help a

711
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,240
more

712
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,480
solidified mentorship process like the

713
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,200
women in cyber security they have a

714
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:17,039
recess they actually have a mentorship

715
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,600
program there so a young woman coming

716
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,760
into the industry can be connected with

717
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,840
somebody that's been in the industry for

718
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,919
a while to provide that mentorship

719
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:30,960
the other thing we need to do is we need

720
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
to help each other one of my favorite

721
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,520
scenes with elle woods is when she's

722
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,960
going through law school for a little

723
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,960
bit she starts learning the ropes some

724
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,559
of the the legal lingo if you will

725
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,640
she goes and she sees this manicurist

726
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,159
you know whenever she's upset she goes

727
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,000
to get her nails done and she confides

728
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,880
in her and they become friends and her

729
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,360
manicurists broke up with her boyfriend

730
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
and her boyfriend still has her dog

731
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,320
rufus and she wants to go get her dog

732
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:01,120
rufus back so elle woods goes with her

733
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,000
out to see the ex-boyfriend

734
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,480
they approach him and elle woods helps

735
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,520
her friend

736
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,000
get her dog back

737
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,880
in our community helping each other is

738
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,720
so critical

739
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,440
there is so much information out there

740
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,520
to be learned and you think about this

741
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,440
conference and the presenters that we

742
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,399
have coming in they are taking time a

743
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,480
lot of them out of their free time they

744
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,320
work all day they're doing their

745
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,720
research at night they are getting their

746
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,360
slide sets ready to come in here and

747
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
share their knowledge with you and when

748
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
you start asking those questions and

749
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
prodding them for information you in

750
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,559
turn are sharing with them and getting

751
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,039
their thought processes going as well

752
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,360
and there are multiple ways that we can

753
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,159
help each other out in this industry we

754
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:52,640
can do it in a professional sense when i

755
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,520
show up at a client's site and they are

756
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,880
having the worst day ever i'm there to

757
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,960
help them through their incident i had a

758
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,679
client recently that caught a ransomware

759
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:06,159
attack right at the beginning their av

760
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,760
caught it they had endpoint threat

761
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,399
monitoring on it was stopped at one

762
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,600
system

763
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,080
the issue was the attackers started

764
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,240
calling them up on the phone and

765
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,520
threatening them you know you need to

766
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,799
reach out to us you need to begin

767
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:20,559
negotiations we need you know you have

768
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,559
to pay around somewhere and you know

769
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,679
they kind of ignored it because they're

770
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
like well it only affected one system we

771
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,760
caught it and then it escalated and it

772
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,760
escalated and finally it ended with the

773
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,640
ddos attack against the company so they

774
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,880
call us and miss amidst all of this

775
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,960
panic and you know we're there to help

776
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,799
them hold their hand through this

777
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,640
process and help them through the

778
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,399
incident when we think about law

779
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:43,840
enforcement

780
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
that's out there looking you know for

781
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,320
the bad people or pen testers that are

782
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,640
helping a company get more secure we're

783
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,039
helping each other out professionally

784
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:55,279
the other thing that we can do is we can

785
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:57,600
share our experiences just like i talked

786
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,320
about the presenters that are here this

787
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:02,960
weekend that are sharing their knowledge

788
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:04,080
with you

789
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,320
i think a lot of the things that i have

790
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,480
learned on this industry have all been

791
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
things that have been shared with people

792
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
that are out there they're doing the

793
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,520
work they're sharing their research

794
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,440
they're doing their blog posts you know

795
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,840
when a brand new vulnerability comes out

796
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,960
these are the people that are putting

797
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,720
the tweets out there so that we can

798
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,039
immediately begin securing our

799
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
environments they're putting honey pots

800
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,399
out there and letting us know what the

801
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:29,760
iocs are we are helping each other we

802
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,320
cannot know it all you know i have an

803
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,799
area of expertise and mine is host-based

804
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,640
forensics there are other people out

805
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,960
there that specialize in malware

806
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,440
pen testing all of these things the more

807
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,000
that we share this information among us

808
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,640
the stronger our community gets as a

809
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,159
whole

810
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,799
and once again community this is huge

811
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,320
and i think it's one of those core

812
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,200
values around cactus con and everything

813
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,360
that happens here and we're here today

814
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,200
because of everybody that's been willing

815
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
to do the sharing um you know i remember

816
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,679
the first time i put out a blog post it

817
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:06,559
was terrifying for me and not a lot of

818
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:08,880
people might want to take that step and

819
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,240
do that so you might be thinking to

820
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,919
yourself well you know i'm not really a

821
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:15,360
presenter and you know i don't blog what

822
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
what can i do

823
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,279
to help out the community from my

824
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,760
standpoint and something as simple as if

825
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,840
you find a bug in a tool go to the

826
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,799
github page and mention that bug a lot

827
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,720
of times people find bug in the software

828
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,480
and they're like oh it doesn't work and

829
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,320
they just move on and they download the

830
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,799
next tool reach out and let that tool

831
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,320
out there know that you had an issue

832
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,799
with it if you find something a new

833
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:41,279
vulnerability or you find a cool new

834
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:43,440
forensic artifact but you're not a

835
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,039
blogger and you don't really tweet and

836
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,120
you're not up in social media reach out

837
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,039
to somebody that is and share that

838
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,120
information with them and let them

839
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,840
explore that and blog post it and push

840
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,399
it out there are still ways that we can

841
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:58,240
help each other in this community to

842
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,960
advance forward okay the next thing we

843
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,240
need to do i talked earlier about egos

844
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,919
now this doesn't mean

845
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,360
oops

846
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,279
this doesn't mean

847
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:16,720
that you shouldn't flex when you need to

848
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,960
another one of my favorite scenes at the

849
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,840
beginning elle woods walks into the shop

850
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,919
and she's there with her friends they're

851
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,399
giggling and they're laughing and she's

852
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,240
looking for a dress for a special

853
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,480
occasion and there's a saleswoman

854
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,640
sitting back going okay you know here's

855
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
here's a blonde she's got daddy's wallet

856
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,960
she's coming and shopping this is this

857
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
is going to be an easy target for me so

858
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,000
she walks over to you know last season's

859
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,200
rack pulls off a dress rips off the the

860
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,360
price tag with the idea that she's going

861
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,120
to try and pull one over l woods i'm

862
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
going to sell her this dress that's

863
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:52,960
normally marked down 50

864
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,399
for full price

865
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,960
and she walks over to elle woods and you

866
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
know says look at this beautiful dress

867
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:01,360
we just got it in and elle woods takes a

868
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,640
look at it and she's like yeah that's

869
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,039
nice and then she starts i don't want to

870
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,039
say ripping her apart but she starts

871
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,519
flexing her knowledge hmm is this made

872
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:11,760
out of you know blah blah rayon is there

873
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,919
a double seam over here and you can see

874
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:16,960
the sales person kind of go like oh like

875
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,200
i don't know what i just walked into

876
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,279
and so l flexes when she needs to she

877
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:24,880
lets people know

878
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,600
her knowledge base and that they cannot

879
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,679
mess with her and i think that is one of

880
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,000
the things that i really like about this

881
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,039
movie is overcoming people's

882
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,000
preconceived notions of you that could

883
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,440
potentially be based on a stereotype and

884
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:44,080
this applies you know not just to women

885
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:46,320
in the industry this applies to you you

886
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,240
know whether your ethnical background

887
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,559
maybe what gender you identify

888
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:52,559
all of us have something about us that

889
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,360
makes us unique and sometimes people

890
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,799
will make assumptions based off of that

891
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:01,519
and your capabilities based off of that

892
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,760
so don't be afraid to flex your

893
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,519
knowledge when you need to flex your

894
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,760
knowledge i remember being on a call

895
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,480
once and as i kind of grown over my

896
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,879
career you know i used to do a lot of

897
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:15,280
the examinations boots on the ground you

898
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,199
know i did windows forensics linux

899
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,320
forensics mac forensics and now i'm in a

900
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,960
management role so i manage a team and i

901
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,399
manage people

902
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,239
but i still have a very technical

903
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,040
background i teach at sans i still

904
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
conduct examinations i'll grab a system

905
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,280
when a big case comes in and i'll do the

906
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,760
analysis right alongside my examiners

907
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,440
but i think there's this preconceived

908
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
notion sometimes because i'm a manager

909
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,560
that i do not have technical skills or

910
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,399
maybe because i'm a woman i don't have

911
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:46,800
technical skills and i was on a phone

912
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,839
call once and i had someone say like hey

913
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,599
mary i know you're not that technical

914
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,199
but i was

915
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,079
okay

916
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,839
we need to get something straight here

917
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,200
okay

918
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
don't be afraid to flex you know

919
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,480
sometimes we have to throw out those

920
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,800
acronyms sometimes we have to dive

921
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:06,000
really deep really fast so that people

922
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,240
understand that we know what we're

923
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:10,320
talking about and i'm not going to let

924
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,680
you make judgments about me

925
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,720
based on some preconceived notion of who

926
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,720
you think i might be

927
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,760
so don't be afraid to flex when you need

928
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,720
to flex but do it gracefully

929
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,240
tactfully

930
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,240
and at the end of it they will respect

931
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,480
you more for it

932
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:31,440
okay

933
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,119
we are going to

934
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,160
relish those victories i think one of

935
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,800
the reasons i love forensics so much is

936
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,520
that feeling of you know i'm working a

937
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,320
case i am hunting an attacker through

938
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:47,200
the network and i find them and i get to

939
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,680
share that news with my client and i get

940
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
to relish that victory you need to take

941
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,320
the time to pat yourself on the back

942
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,240
whether or not it's a goal that you've

943
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,839
been working towards you know that

944
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,599
college degree you finally got that

945
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,760
college degree or maybe it's something

946
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,359
like you know someone was talking

947
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:05,680
earlier today about how they just wanted

948
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,400
to submit something to a contest and you

949
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,160
know they ended up getting third place

950
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,160
and it did a really good job and learned

951
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,400
a lot in the process and then they came

952
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,720
out here and they presented on it the

953
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:19,119
victories can be big or they can be

954
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,359
small but they're definitely something

955
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,920
that we need to reflect on and take that

956
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,480
time and congratulate ourselves for

957
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,280
doing it as we progress forward through

958
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,240
our lives and through our careers for

959
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,320
elle woods it was a fact that she had

960
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,200
made this transition to harvard she

961
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,400
started working very very hard applying

962
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,599
herself and she won a coveted internship

963
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,440
she's like yes jumping up and down in

964
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:48,240
the hallways she won this internship and

965
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,560
she is relishing that victory so that is

966
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,640
something that i found that i like to

967
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,119
make sure i take the time to do because

968
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:57,359
sometimes it can be so easy just to keep

969
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:58,960
going put your nose down to the

970
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,400
grindstone

971
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:04,240
and not take credit for those victories

972
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,480
all right follow your

973
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,880
instincts

974
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
so with elle woods in this particular

975
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:12,640
case

976
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,960
they had she won this internship and

977
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,119
they were representing a client and

978
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,839
everybody swore up and down that this

979
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:21,599
client was

980
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:22,560
guilty

981
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,880
but she had faith in the client she had

982
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,760
taken a spin class from her

983
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,200
out in la

984
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,119
and you know lost four pounds during the

985
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:33,520
class and you know she's like there's no

986
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,119
way she can be guilty and that

987
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,480
character's name was brooke there's no

988
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,880
way brook can be guilty because you know

989
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,480
she does all this exercise and that

990
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,000
makes endorphins and that makes you

991
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,800
happy i don't think she did it and she

992
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,880
followed her instincts and she got

993
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:49,520
brooks alibi even though brooke asked

994
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,680
her not to share it with everybody she

995
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,839
was able to get that alibi which then

996
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,160
kind of sent the team off on the right

997
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,520
track of defending in her and believing

998
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,800
in her

999
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,760
i've had this happen so many times in

1000
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:06,240
cases where i see something that just

1001
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,800
seems a little bit out of place and it's

1002
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,720
kind of following those instincts a lot

1003
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:13,200
of times you don't know exactly why it

1004
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,440
seems off but you just know

1005
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,760
it seems off and that's that thread that

1006
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,480
we have to pull on as investigators and

1007
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:23,200
keep following it to see what's going on

1008
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,079
one of the cases i worked was for a huge

1009
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,320
grocery chain they call this in they

1010
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:29,920
were in a panic they had been working

1011
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,720
the last 24 to 48 hours because their

1012
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:35,040
ids system went off it went off like a

1013
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,280
christmas tree just all of a sudden

1014
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,359
across hundreds of different systems

1015
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,280
within their environment they traced the

1016
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,599
ip address back and it went to a threat

1017
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,839
actor group called dark hotel and this

1018
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:47,920
is an apt group and you know we're going

1019
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,599
to be in so much trouble we've got this

1020
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,640
apt group they're inside of our network

1021
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,640
and i did some research on the ip

1022
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,240
address and the threat actor group it

1023
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,920
was this dark hotel but i was like wait

1024
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,960
a minute this apt group is known for

1025
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,720
targeting hotels that's why they're

1026
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:05,680
called dark hotel and you know high

1027
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,240
value targets like executives to get

1028
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,440
information from them and blackmail them

1029
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,400
why is a grocery chain getting attacked

1030
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,640
by this apt group like

1031
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,200
okay that doesn't make sense i mean sure

1032
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,800
it can be happening i'm going to keep an

1033
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,079
open mind and then i show up on site

1034
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,320
and start conducting the examination

1035
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:29,040
and we find out that the systems that it

1036
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:31,760
triggered on were security systems so it

1037
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,760
wasn't domain controllers it wasn't

1038
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,000
servers it wasn't the point of sale

1039
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:38,079
systems where they collected credit card

1040
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:40,800
information or i should say process not

1041
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,280
collected so i was like wait a minute

1042
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,680
okay it's on the security systems i

1043
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,599
guess the attackers could be watching

1044
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,119
people coming in and out of the grocery

1045
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:51,520
store like i don't know why

1046
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,440
but you know once again like the spider

1047
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,040
sense is just going off like something's

1048
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,800
not right and i start looking at the

1049
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,560
systems closer and analyzing them and i

1050
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,880
notice that the malware is over six

1051
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,040
years old so i'm like okay well i guess

1052
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,359
it could have been maybe time stamped

1053
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,280
and i pull another system and i notice

1054
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,079
that the timestamps are exactly the same

1055
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,160
for the malware on both systems and then

1056
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:13,200
i start looking at all the other

1057
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,200
artifacts and when the operating system

1058
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,880
was installed and i start tracing that

1059
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,960
backwards and i realized what happened

1060
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,880
when i started timelining it out was

1061
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,040
operating system was installed a thumb

1062
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,599
drive was inserted a driver was

1063
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:27,599
installed the driver had the malware in

1064
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,599
it and this was the golden image that

1065
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,319
went out to every single computer within

1066
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,640
the environment now

1067
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,040
this was six years ago what do you think

1068
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,040
happens to ip addresses over the course

1069
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,759
of six years

1070
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,160
they change right very rarely are you

1071
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
going to have an ip address that belongs

1072
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,920
to the same domain or especially the

1073
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:51,119
same threat actor group six years later

1074
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:55,040
so what had happened was that ip address

1075
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,680
this dark hotel group started using

1076
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,520
their intrusion detection system got

1077
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
updated with that new information they

1078
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,359
had this old malware that had been on

1079
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:05,280
the systems for six years all of a

1080
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,400
sudden started tripping their ids and it

1081
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,839
just lit up like a christmas tree and

1082
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:11,760
they went to full panic mode now the

1083
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,359
worst part of this and i'm sure a lot of

1084
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:15,839
you can relate to is we were brought in

1085
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,000
by the socks so it's all hush hush hush

1086
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,079
everybody's being quiet and then you

1087
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:21,599
know i'm like this is on your golden

1088
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:23,040
image and they brought me like you know

1089
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,800
the cd or whatever that had the golden

1090
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,880
image on it and i was able to open it up

1091
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
and view it right there and then they

1092
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,240
went back to their i.t department

1093
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:32,079
they're like oh yeah we knew about that

1094
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:34,560
and like the whole thing totally could

1095
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:36,560
have been avoided with additional

1096
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,839
communication between the two different

1097
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:42,319
you know divisions of the company but i

1098
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:44,720
got to go on a nice trip and uh

1099
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:48,759
hashtag revenue okay

1100
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:52,000
okay the next thing we want to do is we

1101
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,240
need to be bold and we need to take

1102
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:59,200
chances uh elle woods

1103
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:01,200
her law professor the one that is

1104
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,480
running the case

1105
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:05,040
eventually ends up getting fired by the

1106
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,599
client and elle woods knows that she is

1107
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,160
the best person to represent her but she

1108
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:13,920
is just a law student and this is a huge

1109
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,640
high profile murder case

1110
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,119
so she is going to go in and she is

1111
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,560
going to

1112
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,440
run this high profile murder case this

1113
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,920
is completely out of her comfort zone

1114
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:28,240
you know she went from you know a fat

1115
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:30,720
fashion merchandising degree going into

1116
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,880
harvard law school and then she is in

1117
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,680
this high profile murder case

1118
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,280
in our careers

1119
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,920
as you advance you need to be bold you

1120
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,560
need to take chances and you need to

1121
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,280
push yourself further and further

1122
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,440
outside of that comfort zone so that you

1123
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,839
can grow i remember one of the first

1124
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:52,720
times i started speaking publicly i was

1125
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,319
so nervous

1126
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,000
i something i didn't want to do and to

1127
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:57,599
this day sometimes the night before i'm

1128
00:42:57,599 --> 00:42:59,040
like why did i

1129
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,119
why did i say i was going to do this why

1130
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:02,880
am i doing this i just want to be

1131
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,400
playing video games right now i don't

1132
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,079
want to be doing this

1133
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,839
we need to take those chances and we

1134
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:10,960
need to push ourselves to do things new

1135
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,319
if you normally do windows analysis and

1136
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:16,560
a linux system comes in and they're

1137
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
looking for someone to take that on put

1138
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,119
up your hand take that work on push

1139
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:25,280
yourself outside of your comfort zone

1140
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,520
learn something new and you'll find that

1141
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:30,240
you begin to grow professionally

1142
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,200
and as a person as you

1143
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:35,359
go outside of that comfort zone you take

1144
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:37,920
these challenges on you accomplish them

1145
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:40,400
maybe you fail that's okay too because

1146
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:42,880
you will learn something in the process

1147
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:44,319
and you will grow through this and you

1148
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,680
will not remain stagnant in it

1149
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,200
and to that end to be successful at that

1150
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,599
we need to surround ourselves with

1151
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,040
positive people in our lives that will

1152
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:00,400
be there to help encourage us that have

1153
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:03,200
faith in us that know that we can do

1154
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,760
this elle woods constantly throughout

1155
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,440
this movie has herself surrounded by a

1156
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:11,440
support group she has her friends she

1157
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,680
decides she wants to go to law school

1158
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,440
they help her with her studying they

1159
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,680
help her with her lsats they keep her

1160
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,599
from going to the frat party down the

1161
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:20,800
street

1162
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,160
she has her soon-to-be boyfriend that

1163
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,240
encourages her in the middle of the

1164
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,119
testimony she has an unsure moment like

1165
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:31,040
she starts to

1166
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:32,800
buckle a little bit and she's not so

1167
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:35,280
sure of herself so she looks back and he

1168
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,599
gives her an encouraging nod and then

1169
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:39,520
she has a people in her life that she

1170
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:42,240
confides her problems into

1171
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,800
we need those positive people in our

1172
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:47,520
lives that have faith in us that keep us

1173
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,680
moving forward because sometimes when we

1174
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,760
don't think we can do something they

1175
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,520
know that we can do it and they can help

1176
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:56,560
us make that final push in order to get

1177
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,240
it done

1178
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,119
okay and finally i had to bring in

1179
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:06,000
the bend and snap okay yes the bend and

1180
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,680
snap okay

1181
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,040
everybody needs to find their own bend

1182
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,640
and snap this is the way that you stand

1183
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:18,560
out and you set yourself apart as an

1184
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:22,400
expert in your particular field now this

1185
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,240
doesn't have to mean you have to be the

1186
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,880
best pen tester out there or the best

1187
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:29,520
person at windows forensics

1188
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:31,680
i've found that if you make yourself

1189
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,560
that one go-to person for a very

1190
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,200
specific thing that can really help

1191
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:40,000
elevate your career for me it was my

1192
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:41,920
python scripting and programming now

1193
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:44,240
could i tackle a whole you know i don't

1194
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,319
think i would ever work 40 hours as a

1195
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,480
programmer kudos to anybody out there

1196
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,200
that does but i found that python worked

1197
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,280
really well for me for scripting and

1198
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,359
then i really used it for timelining and

1199
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,200
i developed this whole process using

1200
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,520
python to timeline out forensic

1201
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,520
artifacts and i became the go-to person

1202
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,400
for that i also became a go-to person

1203
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,200
for

1204
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
using that scripting to decode malicious

1205
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,480
powershell scripts that we began finding

1206
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,160
in cases we have go-to people for aws we

1207
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:17,359
have go to people for office 365. we

1208
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:21,359
have go to people for powershell so find

1209
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:22,880
that thing

1210
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,319
that you love

1211
00:46:24,319 --> 00:46:26,720

1212
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:30,160
become that go-to person and you will

1213
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,880
become valuable to those around you for

1214
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,800
something that you love to do they'll

1215
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,400
