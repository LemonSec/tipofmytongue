58
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,360

team

61
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:15,280
um

62
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,400
and uh my big claim to fame is the

63
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,000
streaming stuff you guys have seen this

64
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,920
week is all streamed from my laptop

65
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,840
right here so well let me rephrase that

66
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,800
the guys in the back have done an

67
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,200
amazing job but uh yeah my role with

68
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,720
cactus con is with kind of the digital

69
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,400
streaming stuff so if you watched

70
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,480
anything streaming it's because alex

71
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,080
made it happen so yeah

72
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,360
[Applause]

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
i just got some side eye

74
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,200
so uh before we jump into our

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
recommendations for a cfp or call for

76
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
proposals call for papers uh we wanted

77
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680
to show you uh some of the statistics

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,200
from this past year which are actually

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,959
pretty cool so we use this platform

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,959
called sessionize which makes it very

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,239
easy to submit uh for us as the review

82
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
board to go through all of the all the

83
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,959
the submitted things accept and reject

84
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,720
them and then build a schedule out of

85
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,959
them i would super super recommend

86
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,480
session eyes to anybody who's planning

87
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,080
any kind of an event and they'll let you

88
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,640
use it for free if you don't charge like

89
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:15,440
us

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,239
so uh as you can see from here we had

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,800
our uh our cfp was open for about two

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,519
months um we had a little spike up here

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,200
at the beginning of people who are real

94
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,360
go-getters but most of you are real late

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,200
to the game that's fine it's because you

96
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,799
were fleshing out your ideas i

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,159
understand we had 111 submissions this

98
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
year which i don't know if that was a

99
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
max but we had

100
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,080
there was quite a few

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,280
and from 95 different speakers most of

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,920
those are introductory and overview we

103
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,840
did have some intermediate a few

104
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,000
advanced

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,680
and then i think this little red line

106
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,040
down there those are actually our

107
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
workshops so

108
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,120
we had a pretty robust

109
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,840
call for papers this

110
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,120
year and as we were going through all of

111
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,560
them we were having this conversation of

112
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,200
you know it's really hard to submit to a

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,360
cfp it can be kind of intimidating and

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,560
sometimes you don't really know what

115
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,680
people want

116
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,280
on the other side of the coin it's

117
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,920
really challenging to review cfp

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,040
submissions as well i would love to be

119
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
like you know bright and shiny and

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
rested when i'm looking through all of

121
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,160
the submissions but this really sums it

122
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
up i am a tired sleepy female person

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,680
with a cup of coffee working at a

124
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,720
computer

125
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
uh and so

126
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,880
thinking about who your audience is and

127
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,199
the and how they're reviewing

128
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,600
helps you to understand to

129
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,479
help us to help you be a speaker at

130
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,000
cactus con or any of the other

131
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,840
conferences that you might be submitting

132
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,880
to

133
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,120
so we thought we'll make this this talk

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
and have a conversation about what uh

135
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
what cfp boards are usually looking for

136
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
i know we promised you real world

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,160
feedback but it seemed really mean to

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,960
bring up particular talks that we didn't

139
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,880
like uh so i i created some fake ones

140
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,360
here and we'll see what the panel here

141
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,880
has to say about them

142
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,919
to do that i used the netflix show

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,759
gorgeous ladies of wrestling has anyone

144
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,039
seen it

145
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,600
yes a few people have seen it full

146
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,919
disclosure i have not

147
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,440
season one was really good i haven't

148
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,280
watched the rest i haven't watched it i

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,960
just love to flex

150
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,600
yeah well then you're here for it you

151
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,039
got the hair gorgeous all right

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
cool uh so no actual proposers were

153
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,759
harmed in the making of this talk we

154
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,000
made up some examples based on some of

155
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,680
the characters so let's let's take a

156
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,960
look you guys ready yep all right

157
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,120
here's our first one we get a lot of

158
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,360
them like this securing your network by

159
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,120
liberty bill

160
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,800
do you know what it takes to secure your

161
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,199
network against threats i'll discuss

162
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,800
this and more let's go

163
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,199
what do you guys think is wrong with

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,680
this one alex so my initial impression

165
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:02,080
is i have no idea what we're talking

166
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:02,960
about

167
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,319
um you know i look at the things like

168
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,080
secure your network secure them how

169
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,319
secure them against what um we'll

170
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,560
discuss this and more what's more uh

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:11,919
there's just to me there's not enough

172
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,160
detail in this for me to even know where

173
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
this talk is going to begin

174
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,120
yeah i mean we got a few of these

175
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,280
that that you know it's like probably a

176
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,199
good topic and and

177
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,520
they probably have experience with it

178
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:27,039
but we don't know what experience that

179
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,199
is or what what pieces of it they're

180
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,120
going to talk about so i mean a lot of

181
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,800
times it was just like if you would have

182
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,680
given me just three things you're gonna

183
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,840
talk about or like what are your

184
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,919
credentials because you know sometimes

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,280
people don't have things published in

186
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,039
the easiest places to find we might look

187
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,400
at someone's twitter and be like oh

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,479
you've been in the offensive security

189
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,680
for 20 years and they're like we're

190
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,199
gonna talk about red team let's go and

191
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,800
you've published like five books and

192
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:53,759
we're like oh oh okay yeah you probably

193
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:54,560
know

194
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
yeah i totally agree with haley i think

195
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,400
that you know she mentions not only the

196
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,199
content of the presentation but the bio

197
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,720
as well and i actually really pay a lot

198
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,000
of attention to the bio because

199
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,440
occasionally you recognize names you're

200
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,880
like oh this person's legit it's worth

201
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,720
rolling the dice but has anyone ever

202
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,440
seen uh scanner darkly in the movie yeah

203
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,120
so there's a scene they wear a special

204
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,039
suit that constantly changes their faces

205
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,319
and i just remember there's one scene

206
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,000
where someone introduces the character

207
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,599
and says ladies and gentlemen the vague

208
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
blur and that was the first thing i

209
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,680
thought of when i saw this so it's just

210
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,720
what is this

211
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
yeah i think the bio is a really big

212
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,080
thing here just all we know is hacker

213
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,919
wrestler and likes pool which like haley

214
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,440
was saying if this person is a

215
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,680
well-known person in the industry books

216
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,759
presentations spoken a lot of places

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,919
that's one thing but uh as someone's

218
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,440
seeing this i don't know who that is and

219
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,720
that doesn't tell me why this person is

220
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,759
credentialed to be able to say these

221
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:44,479
things

222
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,000
and i think that that goes to show that

223
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
you shouldn't assume right like i know

224
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,680
who this person is because i've watched

225
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,680
this show you've never watched this show

226
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,599
so you don't know who this person is so

227
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,599
you know be sure to give us enough

228
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:56,879
detail about who you are and what you're

229
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
talking about this seems ridiculous

230
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,639
doesn't it but we got so many things

231
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,400
where like i actually made a twitter

232
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
thread saying please give us more than

233
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,280
three sentences in your cactus con cfp

234
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,039
because we got so many of them were

235
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,039
literally three sentences long

236
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,800
so can i say one thing i like about it

237
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,639
yeah i think that the first sentence

238
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,000
actually is kind of an interesting hook

239
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
i kind of wanted to keep reading i think

240
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
that there is room for like laconic um

241
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,000
talk descriptions you know i don't often

242
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
go over five sentences for mine

243
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
uh but yes it very much goes from like

244
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,599
do you know what it takes you're like oh

245
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,120
i don't know and then you're there's no

246
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,759
clue if i know what it takes or not yeah

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,360
they'll show up and be i was hoping you

248
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,479
guys would know that's my talk

249
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:37,919
all right so not enough detail on the

250
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:41,039
talk or the speaker uh we got some of

251

these too so top five hacks of 2022 and

252
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,360

00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,720
named a gartner magic quadrant

254

nation state apt attacks through

automated robust zero trust blockchain

258
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
that seamlessly uses the power of

259
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
artificial intelligence and machine

260
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,320
learning also as a black unicorn award

261
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,560
it's only a 60 minute talk we are

262
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
recognized leaders in accelerating your

263
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
visibility with next i can't even like i

264
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,320
can't you guys get where this is going

265
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,120
right

266
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,839
uh haley what do you think about it

267
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,640
uh it has lots of words

268
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,080
it has so many

269
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,880
but but it's it's just it's buzzwordy

270
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,760
and and i think that that's almost like

271
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,920
gingerly approached by you know we we

272
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,000
want a talk here at the con

273
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,519
conference in a lot of cyber security

274
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
conferences that like

275
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,680
speak to people that not as a vendor

276
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,200
selling a product

277
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:35,680
but as a person giving you wisdom from

278
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,440
like hard-earned experience and this

279
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
doesn't sound like wisdom this sounds

280
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,920
like a sales pitch that last line

281
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,000
onboard bush what is onboard bash hour

282
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
production zero trust empower your

283
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,200
defenders this is this is a vendor pitch

284
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,360
today also i wanna know how much they

285
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
paid for the black unicorn award because

286
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,040
that sounds like one of those

287
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
you know we paid an affirm and got an

288
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,760
award yeah i do want to give a shout out

289
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,920
to xena olsen also known as cheerio for

290
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
writing this for me uh i asked her to do

291
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,600
a bash howard paragraph and she came up

292
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,240
with this gorgeous piece

293
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,279
you know i actually think there's

294
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,560
there's room for vendors in our

295
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
conversations right we got to know what

296
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,320
the um you know what what's out there

297
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,760
you know and as a manager at my job it's

298
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
hard to always know but i don't come to

299
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,279
cactus con for that i think this is kind

300
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,120
of a know your audience issue you know

301
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,360
if i was going to you know there's like

302
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,200
the arizona tech summit

303
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,360
like sell me there right that's fine you

304
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,120
know whatever but for cactus it's more

305
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,720
of a community driven event i think it's

306
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,160
just a real fail in annoying your

307
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,200
audience

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,320
i agree yeah and i think there's also

309
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,720
we had people from vendors that like you

310
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,120
could tell by their abstract

311
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,440
that it was more of like a shared wisdom

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,200
thing like we are in this space so we

313
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,800
have learned a lot about these types of

314
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,480
things but it wasn't like get our

315
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,079
product or you won't be able to do any

316
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,920
of those things yep i'm not gonna name

317
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,440
names we had a couple of great examples

318
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,120
of those kind of things just just in the

319
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
last two days that were clearly people

320
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
who were sharing their wisdom as experts

321
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
because they founded or ran companies

322
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
but didn't make it a pitch for their

323
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,480
company

324
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,920
yep and it could be a fine line but

325
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,680
that's one that we we try to we try to

326
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,839
look for

327
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:09,279
all right we know the problems there all

328
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,480
right

329
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,839
bananas they are

330
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,120
b-a-n-a-n-a-s technically berries from a

331
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
botanical perspective are produced by

332
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,079
several types of herbaceous in the

333
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,440
genius moosa

334
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,360
grown in over 135 countries and also

335
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
used to make fiber banana wine and

336
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,640
banana beer

337
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,279
all these things are true alex

338
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:29,600
yes all of those things are true

339
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,760
uh

340
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,760
yeah i mean i like bananas as much as

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,399
you all but this isn't bananacon

342
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,920
i think that's what it boils down to for

343
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,079
me is is we talked briefly a minute ago

344
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,240
about know your audience and this is

345
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,320
this is it honestly and it's a good

346
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
uh submission i i like what we're

347
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
talking about i like the knowledge level

348
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,240
but i don't like it for cactus con

349
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,399
that's true yeah i mean i even

350
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,560
we joked about uh like someone just

351
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,800
making a instead of bananas about like

352
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,560
cacti but

353
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,480
but i mean honestly if you tied together

354
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,160
sort of like something about defensive

355
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,200
security and cactus and you know like

356
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,279
features of cacti that

357
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,560
you can see the analogy and cyber

358
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,560
security that would be great actually it

359
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,480
would probably like tickle us a little

360
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
bit so like my talk that didn't get

361
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,519
submitted for cac that didn't get

362
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,519
approved for cactus on 18 comparing the

363
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,880
common vulnerability scoring system of

364
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
dungeons and dragons

365
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,519
right didn't did not get accepted

366
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,360
i would have i'm just saying

367
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,040
so i've actually had a little bit of the

368
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:29,440
opposite experience i have cfp'd a uh

369
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,600
talk about stoicism in the context of

370
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,600
infosec before um

371
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,360
and you know to your point i i did call

372
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,360
that out it's called stow a sec and i

373
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,040
grabbed some quotes from a few different

374
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,800
you know famous stoics throughout

375
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,639
history and talk about that but it

376
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,240
really is like a talk about stoicism

377
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,000
right there's not that much infosec in

378
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,839
there that being said i would love to

379
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,760
watch this talk just not not a cactus

380
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,040
and especially the other thing to keep

381
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:52,320
in mind and this is something that

382
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,160
terrifies me as a speaker

383
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,160
is when i get accepted and i look at the

384
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,639
agenda and i see who i'm up against

385
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,839
and it's especially if there's multi

386
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,360
tracks like this and it's like oh are

387
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,120
you going to go to the banana talk are

388
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,560
you going to go to the nerd core rapper

389
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,000
who's dropping knowledge and tools on

390
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,440
people right

391
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,399
so

392
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:09,279
yeah

393
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
yep and you know this this one is

394
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,680
obviously farcical it's a i i

395
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,959
was sitting there in the controller but

396
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,399
i said alex give me a random topic and

397
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,839
he said bananas and this is what i can

398
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,279
do

399
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,519
but we did get a lot of speed a lot of

400
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:22,880
submissions it didn't have anything to

401
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
do with security you know cactus con is

402
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,519
very specifically a security conference

403
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
information security so yeah use

404
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,760
analogies or bring in you know we've had

405
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,839
people speak about hacking in mental

406
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,440
health before we've had people speak

407
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,279
about diversity we've had a lot of

408
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:38,480
different things but it always kind of

409
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,880
comes back to what would somebody in

410
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,680
infosec want to know about this um

411
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,720
and

412
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,639
because we had a few that were

413
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,880
almost purely development

414
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,519
but because like devsecops etc so forth

415
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,839
like there's definitely a lot of

416
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,680
interlinking topics to security and

417
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,480
development but some were pure dev talks

418
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,920
and it's like yeah it just wasn't it

419
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,600
wasn't a good fit and there are cons for

420
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,880
those things and they're a great place

421
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,560
to submit those talks

422
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
just knowing which which conference

423
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,839
you're submitting to is super important

424
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,120
knowing what it is

425
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,199
if you are a dev go west was a very

426
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,040
enjoyable con to speak at it was

427
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,199
straight up pure dev but yeah so if

428
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,560
you're interested in that check out go

429
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,560
west i'm not affiliated anyway they're

430
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:19,920
just a really really great committee to

431
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,240
deal with

432
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,160
all right here's another thing that we

433
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,920
see sometimes

434
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,440
mobile security machine learning how we

435
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,279
build an empire in this talk we'll

436
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:30,639
discuss how to build a home lab to

437
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:32,480
investigate mobile device security we

438
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,199
will then talk through some

439
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:34,320
state-of-the-art machine learning

440
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,079
approaches to vulnerability detection

441
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:37,920
and exploit generation then we'll

442
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,519
explore the various social engineering

443
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,959
pretexts that have been successful for

444
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,880
our team and how those engagements were

445
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,800
communicated to management to increase

446
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
our budget for training and tools by 30

447
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,480
and we're going to do that in 20 minutes

448
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,279
kevin do you think that they can

449
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,959
some people in the conference scene

450
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,440
refer to me as thor because i absolutely

451
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
love lightning talks my first talk was

452
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,199
15 minutes any talk that i do now try to

453
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,920
be you know at 20 minutes but given that

454
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:06,480
i love that time constraint you have to

455
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,720
have one topic one topic that you hit

456
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,880
real hard in here i count it at least

457
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,199
five maybe like up to seven to ten

458
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,720
different like sub areas you could break

459
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,519
into

460
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,360
and think about this not only do you

461
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,760
lose the the plot a little bit with the

462
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,320
topics you're talking about but that q a

463
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,880
section is going to be a mess

464
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,320
right so you want people to be able to

465
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,240
focus and engage and grow on your

466
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,079
content so i think this one really fails

467
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:31,120
from uh

468
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
a couple you know pieces and also last

469
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,759
thing the sort of horizontal breadth of

470
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,440
it i'm like i like talks because i like

471
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,519
to go deep right i want to increase my

472
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,759
t-shape worker size and this kind

473
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,079
doesn't really do it for me

474
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
yeah i even think of a talk i submitted

475
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,320
to uh the women in cyber security

476
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,959
conference for this year and that was

477
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,199
their feedback was like because i threw

478
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,680
in some things into the abstract because

479
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,800
i had one slide about x i thought it

480
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,160
would be cool to throw that in the

481
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,920
abstract but that actually made the cfv

482
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,079
board a little more like

483
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:05,680
can you really talk about all these

484
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,320
things um so if i i think if i would

485
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,000
have kept it a little more focused on my

486
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,240
like three things i truly was going to

487
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
talk about i probably would have gotten

488
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
accepted

489
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,800
yeah there's just a lot of topics in

490
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,399
here and all of them are good and all of

491
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,720
them are relevant but tried to cram them

492
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,639
all into 20 minutes with this number of

493
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,639
people you know i like talks with

494
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,320
multiple people i love panels we're

495
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,680
trying to think of how do we bring in

496
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:30,480
more multi-party talks but you are going

497
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,560
to have this many people cycling in and

498
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:35,360
out and spending most of your time just

499
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,560
figuring out who's going to be at the

500
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,480
mic i mean if we look at

501
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,399
let's just say if there's five topics in

502
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:41,680
there 20 minutes that's four minutes per

503
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,800
topic that's i think our intro took

504
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,920
twice that

505
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,639
so it's yeah there's just no way to do

506
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,079
anything more than just scratch the

507
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,920
surface of that in format it just

508
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
doesn't really work

509
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,040
yep if you want to really get into

510
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,399
something feel free to ask for the

511
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,160
longer time slot or maybe it's a

512
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,079
workshop you know sometimes people have

513
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,160
given some good suggestions for talks

514
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,079
and they end up building them out into a

515
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,160
two-hour workshop instead so think about

516
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,000
what is really the right delivery system

517
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,520
for the topic that you want to get into

518
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,480
you know the other thing i'll say on

519
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,839
this one is

520
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,199
um it is five topics submit five five

521
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,359
presentations for us you know we

522
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,439
had at least a couple of speakers this

523
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,319
year who did two presentations because

524
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,839
their talks were that good and obviously

525
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:25,359
we probably wouldn't put five from the

526
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,439
same speaker it'd be like this track is

527
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,240
all jamie just all day jamie jamie con

528
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,000
as the cfp lead i endorse this no i do

529
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,799
not yes i do not so yeah but but you can

530
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,799
submit multiple talks and

531
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:40,240
make them good and you might get

532
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,440
selected for more than one i think is

533
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,440
the point yeah and and your point is

534
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,799
there to

535
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,880
make them good because some people have

536
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,400
this kind of spray and pray approach

537
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,919
like they really want to get selected to

538
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,320
speak somewhere and so they're grabbing

539
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,919
some ideas and throwing them out there

540
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,679
and we're getting these very short

541
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,120
abstracts that don't have a lot of

542
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,559
detail that really span the space um and

543
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:04,080
we you know in instead of coming up with

544
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
six uh not very well thought through

545
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:09,520
ideas like uh like on this one i'm not

546
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:11,520
going to read all the the titles just a

547
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,880
big slew of titles uh think about what's

548
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,160
like what are the couple of things that

549
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
you're really great at and that you want

550
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,919
to share and spend your time on on those

551
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,039
ones flushing those out

552
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:25,600
if you had to do one haley which one

553
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,120
would you do

554
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,960
as like i feel like any of those are

555
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:30,240
like lightning talks yeah you just had

556
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,480
to pick them up whose slide is it anyway

557
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,160
uh

558
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,720
that would be

559
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,720
i think 1.5 steps to a more secure

560
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,960
environment just so i can talk about rba

561
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,200
thank you you you love rba i know she

562
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,559
gave a talk

563
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,320
dc480 about rba you should do it again

564
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,840
next year like yeah give it a few months

565
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
join dc 480 by the way hit me up

566
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
afterwards if you have questions

567
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,240
i'm going to go to that talk because i

568
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,520
want to know how to take half a step to

569
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,640
do something

570
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,760
that sounds

571
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,120
sounds efficient i want to know more

572
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,799
about tacos

573
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,880
just because i like tacos sure the

574
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
fundamental backbone yes

575
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
i think we should do this someone should

576
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,320
give this talk next year please somebody

577
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,840
give this talk yeah i'd love to see some

578
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:09,760
discord hacks i like i write like

579
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,120
writing bots for discord but you know

580
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,559
i'm sure there's some cool stuff in

581
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,520
there

582
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,600
i've generally found that when i'm

583
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
sort of soliciting for cfps i really

584
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,679
like to focus on one because

585
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,799
it takes a lot of effort to make a

586
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,640
really good talk and to do the research

587
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
and i love doing live demos because i'm

588
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,799
a complete idiot and they fail like half

589
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,160
the time but it's all good

590
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,520
um whereas if i get solicited for a talk

591
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,240
by someone i'll usually like kind of

592
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,080
spec out two or three ideas to make sure

593
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,480
that's what they want but i would say

594
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:41,600
especially if you haven't cfp before

595
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
maybe two at the most that are

596
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:47,440
reasonably fully fleshed out so

597
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,480
great

598
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:53,760
all right a new approach to currency in

599
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
crypto bucks

600
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,039
and this taco present a whole new

601
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,640
approach to revolutionizing the

602
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,880
international financial markets by

603
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
utilizing advanced encryption schemes

604
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,640
and ledgers that are distributed in

605
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,400
order to make a decentralized currency

606
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,840
this has the idea

607
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,919
the potential to change economies

608
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,559
globally

609
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,880
oh do you mean do you mean blockchain

610
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
that thing that everyone knows and

611
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,360
already has a word it's different it's

612
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,399
it's in crypto books

613
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,760
not buying it yeah not really i think

614
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,760
you know just uh trying to redef like

615
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,360
i think it is important to have terms

616
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,440
that describe things but like trying to

617
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,280
introduce a new term to make it seem

618
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,679
like something different uh you know

619
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
doesn't work for you

620
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
i think the other thing is is i don't

621
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,840
really understand is this a new approach

622
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,600
uh this into what hayley said is this a

623
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,280
new approach or is this cryptocurrency

624
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
or is this just

625
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,400
the same talk that i've seen over and

626
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,120
over again at seven other cons uh over

627
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,960
the last 20 years i know we were having

628
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,679
a conversation with uh andrew uh in the

629
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:01,520
back room about talks that he seen at

630
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,880
other cons and it's like where were you

631
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,400
20 years ago when i was doing exactly

632
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,320
the same thing and you know seeing

633
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
presentations that are literally the

634
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
same presentation i've seen from other

635
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,919
presenters over and over again uh if you

636
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:13,600
have a new take on it or a new spin or

637
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,039
you're presenting something new that's

638
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,960
that's amazing that's wonderful or to a

639
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,559
different audience but just showing me

640
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:19,919
the same talk i've seen over and over

641
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,840
again doesn't excite me

642
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,080
and just slapping the words new and

643
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
revolutionary onto something don't make

644
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,440
it

645
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,200
any different have a great new take on

646
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:30,480
something sure

647
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,320
but have you heard about rba

648
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
it's the new thing it's so new

649
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,280
and and people have been doing it

650
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,960
javascript fingerprinting on browsers

651
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,760
since like 2005.

652
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,960
i think for me having you just seen this

653
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,360
like there's sort of a proselytation or

654
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
possible proselytizing that comes with

655
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,600
it and i don't really want to like

656
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,120
watch a sermon i guess is what i'm

657
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,559
trying to say you know where it's like

658
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,960
there's almost too much enthusiasm in

659
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,320
this and i was like well let's have a

660
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,840
reasoned conversation because i feel

661
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,360
like i can't go to this talk and ask

662
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,679
questions because if i'm like well what

663
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,520
what does the immutability of this you

664
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,440
know chain of blocks we'll call it you

665
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,720
know like what's the implications of

666
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,480
that for like crime you know and like

667
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,200
well they're not going to want to

668
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,360
address that so

669
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,799
that's pretty wild you would have to

670
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:16,720
sign up for their newsletter to get that

671
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,120
yeah there's some stack for sure it's 20

672
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,640
yes

673
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,320
but they they promote bitcoin but they

674
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,080
only take cash though right yeah so

675
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:26,640
they're intellectually anyway

676
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:27,919
so uh

677
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,080
we did promise some real world feedback

678
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:32,240
and so we actually do have an actual

679
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,640
cactus content cfp submission we chose

680
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,320
one that was really good that all of us

681
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
really liked it was very highly ranked

682
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
and i asked i asked the submitter if we

683
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
would be able to share it that's not to

684
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,799
say others weren't all so awesome right

685
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:46,480
yeah there were lots of great ones

686
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,559
obviously we had a whole three tracks

687
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:51,840
stacked up with amazing talks um just i

688
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:53,919
picked this one because it fit well on a

689
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,600
slide and

690
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,480
yeah

691
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
and or said that we could share it so i

692
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,440
won't read it out loud but basically

693
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:02,640
what this

694
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,480
what these couple of paragraphs give us

695
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,960
are the outline of a talk they give us

696
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,360
enough information without going so far

697
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
into the weeds that we know what this

698
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,440
talk is going to be about we can compare

699
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,840
it to some of the other submissions that

700
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
might be on the same topic because

701
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,840
topics do tend to group you know this

702
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,520
year was kind of the year of ransomware

703
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:22,799
talks we got a lot of those and we

704
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,320
selected a lot of them because it's very

705
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,720
relevant right now um

706
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,840
but there's

707
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,200
one of the things i really like about

708
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,360
this too is in that last paragraph he

709
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,799
says i'll share the techniques used as

710
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:35,039
well as source code if you can give us

711
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,880
something like source code like a

712
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,720
framework like something that people can

713
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:41,279
take with them and use then that is

714
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,120
incredibly valuable

715
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,039
i really liked that in the second to

716
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,200
last paragraph he says i will present a

717
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,400
lazy performance cost-efficient approach

718
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
it's that sort of like clearly someone

719
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,080
doing the thing that just wants it to

720
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,720
work uh and you know

721
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:58,960
they work at akamai as a primary

722
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,600
researcher so this is them sharing

723
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,640
wisdom

724
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
you know it's not like use akamai and

725
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,480
you can solve it it's like i figured out

726
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,400
this thing about javascript obfuscation

727
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,760
and what you can do to solve the

728
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,120
problems with it

729
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,200
and uh so yeah i just really liked this

730
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
one yeah and it was a great talk too i

731
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,039
think one thing that jumps a couple

732
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,240
things actually but the first thing is

733
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,600
the title and we haven't talked a lot

734
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,080
about the titles of the talks um you

735
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,000
know as i was doing a lot of the editing

736
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,080
to get the videos for the virtual track

737
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,960
up on youtube uh i found a couple talks

738
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,320
that the titles

739
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
you know were either too long too short

740
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,840
and we had to figure out you know things

741
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,360
like that so you look at this title

742
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:36,880
javascript obfuscation is all about the

743
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
packers it could have been javascript

744
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,600
obfuscation as an attendee that doesn't

745
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,760
jump out as a super exciting topic for

746
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,080
me the opposite is if it said javascript

747
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,679
objection it's all about the packers a

748
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,520
new novel approach to

749
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,919
obfuscating javascript that title fits

750
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,480
this long on a slide and

751
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,400
i've already lost my interest by

752
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,159
mid-reed and it gives you that question

753
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,240
why did he spell out packers like that

754
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,320
and he answered that in the talk uh yes

755
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:03,679
it leaves you with like something

756
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:05,200
interesting is going on here i want to

757
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,960
know more

758
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,600
a little career hack is i like to put

759
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,120
some of my like selected talks on my

760
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,440
resume and if it's too long right it's

761
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,400
like

762
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,080
it just takes up too much room and if

763
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,360
it's too short then you know you don't

764
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,520
really get any you know cachet with the

765
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,360
people reviewing your resume so it's

766
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,760
that middle of the road um length i

767
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
think is huge of getting like the right

768
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
title down

769
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:28,880
anything else the content here that you

770
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,000
would want to

771
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,279
talk about

772
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,360
and i think for me like releasing tools

773
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,039
with your talks is absolutely awesome

774
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,200
not everyone's a dev so it's not every

775
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,520
you know talk needs to have a tool but

776
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,760
i think being able to create a tool demo

777
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,279
that and then you can really engage with

778
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:44,799
your audience afterwards you get github

779
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,720
or whatever is like it's huge i try to

780
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,240
always release a tool with every talk

781
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
that i give except for stosis and i was

782
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,039
a really hard one to come up with a

783
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,039
python script for um but i'm working on

784
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:54,320
a message of the day server that gives

785
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,320
you still a quote so stay tuned for that

786
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,480
yeah you can do it yeah i'm into it i do

787
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,559
i want to rewrite xynet d and go just

788
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
like as a fun exercise but i haven't got

789
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,000
around to it yet i have a seven month

790
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
year old baby so she takes a lot of my

791
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:06,960
time

792
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,640
she's probably not very stoic the other

793
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,799
thing about this the content of this is

794
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,120
it flows really well what this shows me

795
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,360
is is this presenter sat down they wrote

796
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,880
an outline of their talk and they use

797
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,640
that outline to inform their call for

798
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,640
you know call for a person it's not just

799
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
i'm going to sit down and just type a

800
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,600
paragraph of what i'm thinking about

801
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,679
this tells me this talk is prepared it

802
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
flows well it's got an order there's

803
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,880
clearly thought and outline that went

804
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,039
into this presentation and i always give

805
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:32,960
this recommendation for proposals that i

806
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,799
review but it's the the same thing with

807
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,960
a cfp submission have somebody else read

808
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,720
it does it make sense to them what's

809
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,400
that flow like can they give you some

810
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,000
suggestions because you're going to be

811
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,679
giving it to people who again are you

812
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,440
know tired sleepy female person with a

813
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,919
cup of coffee and a computer uh

814
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,720
speaking for myself uh but you

815
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,720
just help us to to get through it

816
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,080
another thing i want to point out here

817
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,520
is there's the description in the title

818
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,200
of the talk then there's the notes and

819
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,039
comments section and this is probably

820
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,200
specific to session eyes but you can do

821
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
this in other submissions too this is

822
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
where you would like can can speak a

823
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,039
little more directly to the reviewers so

824
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,760
people will say here you know here's um

825
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,400
i can do this in uh you know 20 minutes

826
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,559
or 50 minutes let me know which if it's

827
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,159
better or they'll have you know special

828
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,480
recommendations or questions

829
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,559
so this is a this is a valuable place to

830
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,799
put stuff that isn't that's relevant to

831
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,640
what you want to do but are isn't part

832
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,799
of the actual pitch itself

833
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:28,720
yeah and i think this is uh it was like

834
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,000
an ideal

835
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,080
submission uh but we had others that

836
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
were literally just one paragraph and

837
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,440
then a breakdown of their slides pretty

838
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,880
much was what it seemed like like it

839
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,799
wasn't out maybe it was an outline and

840
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:39,919
they didn't have slides but they would

841
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,120
get them ready

842
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,320
and i mean

843
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,760
i think his was a little more polished

844
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,679
with like the nice flow of the structure

845
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:47,360
but we approved quite a few of those

846
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,120
that had just the abstract like the

847
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,279
outline directly after that paragraph

848
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,279
because it did especially with those

849
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,080
talks that sounded generic like we're

850
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,559
talking about threat intel but then your

851
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:00,880
slides it break it gave a breakdown of

852
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,159
what they were actually going to talk

853
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,840
about and that's why we approved it i

854
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,120
think there was a couple that even had

855
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,799
minute by minute time stamps from this

856
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
time to this time i'm talking about this

857
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,360
yeah i i i appreciate that they're able

858
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,799
to do that i would not ever be able to

859
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:14,480
do that you don't have to do that i've

860
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,039
i've never

861
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:22,158
good for you well and you spoke so

862
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:23,520
all right

863
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,279
so basically just the things that we

864
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,919
liked about this it was specific but it

865
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
was concise it wasn't you know eons of

866
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,039
paragraphs uh but it told us exactly

867
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,640
what the talk was going to be about it

868
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,799
was relevant to cactus con it fit in

869
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:39,520
very well they were useful sharing that

870
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,919
source code and in addition to giving

871
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,320
the presentation it was a unique topic

872
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:46,080
we hadn't seen something specifically

873
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
like this it was a nice addition to the

874
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,000
agenda and it was the right amount of

875
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,000
time to cover the material i think if he

876
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,840
had listed this as a 20-minute talk we

877
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,520
would have been a little bit skeptical

878
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,520
about that yeah

879
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,640
okay

880
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,320
great

881
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
well those were our examples we hope

882
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,799
that you liked them and we really hope

883
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:05,840
that you'll

884
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
submit to our cactus con 11 cfp

885
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,840
like i said this is really us about you

886
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,000
help us to choose your talk we have you

887
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,559
know maybe 30 chunks of time that we can

888
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,640
invest so give us the great reasons to

889
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,640
invest in you and we are looking forward

890
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,720
to your submissions next year

891
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,880
any closing thoughts from anybody else

892
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
on the panel i just wanted to mention uh

893
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,919
something we didn't exactly get to is

894
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,399
like a lot of times there's like

895
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:35,840
uh a topic that is probably covered

896
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,159
quite a bit like we had a great talk

897
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,440
this year of like my first year as a

898
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,360
cyber security analyst which is really

899
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,039
helpful for so many people and

900
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,720
especially that's sort of like what i'll

901
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,240
actually be doing in the first year of

902
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,360
the job

903
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,760
but sometimes that topic can be

904
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,559
saturated um so like that person i think

905
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:54,880
we had a few other ones that were like

906
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,720
that but i think their breakdown in the

907
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,799
submission was much stronger than the

908
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:00,799
other submissions right so just to be

909
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,960
aware that like the type of talk you

910
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,120
give i don't know if there's many stoic

911
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,159
yeah stoicism talks so like depending on

912
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:09,679
what you're submitting there could also

913
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,840
be just a saturation in that topics

914
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,679
which could make it more difficult so

915
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
whatever you can do to make it stand out

916
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,000
really helps yeah fun story i was

917
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,159
speaking i think cactus khan two or

918
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,679
three and i was doing a workshop called

919
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:23,039
packets for people and it was network

920
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,799
forensics analysis

921
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,480
and there was so many network forensics

922
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:28,480
analysis talks that year that i got

923
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,440
accepted but then they took someone else

924
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,880
his name was gavin they put him on the

925
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,080
schedule and i

926
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,600
hit up skyler who i was working with and

927
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,279
i was like hey what what happened i

928
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:38,559
realized i had been insufficiently

929
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,640
precise and like describing what my talk

930
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,960
was it was indistinguishable from what

931
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,039
it was also a very good talk so yeah

932
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,600
just be real specific about that

933
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:48,880
great

934
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,880
closing thoughts from you alex uh i'm

935
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,799
just happy to be here

936
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,600
we're happy you're here oh yeah

937
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,039
it's just mind-blowing how many great

938
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,720
submissions we had this year and and

939
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,880
just because we didn't select a talk

940
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,399
doesn't mean it wasn't

941
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,080
amazing outstanding submission doesn't

942
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,720
mean that we didn't like it just we like

943
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:07,919
jimmy said we have a limited number of

944
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:08,960
slots

945
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,440
we even added more slots yeah i

946
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,360
this was supposed to be a two-track con

947
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,200
and i said they're we have to have a

948
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,440
third track these people are too great

949
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,200
so uh but

950
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
we really we spent a lot of time we

951
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,320
spend a lot of time reading through

952
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,559
these things and and making sure that

953
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,720
the the agenda makes sense and that it's

954
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,559
it's enriching for everybody so we're

955
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,840
grateful for all the time that people

956
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,760
put into it um

957
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,840

[Music]

00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:07,039
well we want to make sure we have the

1010
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:09,120
box so our virtual people listening can

1011
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,799
hear the questions too

1012
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,559
but we can we can pass it back like like

1013
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:15,279
beach ball style

1014
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:21,120
that's fun

1015
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,559
are the catch boxes on

1016
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,600
there we go oh don't take it out of the

1017
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,760
box

1018
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,080
where are you publishing the cfp this

1019
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,600
year

1020
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,440
we put it on our website we put it out

1021
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,679
on twitter we'll send it out

1022
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:41,760
through a variety of channels and it's

1023
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,440
usually open for two months so we want

1024
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,360
to make sure that people know that it's

1025
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,000
open and have a chance to think of their

1026
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,919
ideas and to shape them a little bit one

1027
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:51,519
thing i really liked about using session

1028
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,120
eyes this year is that people could go

1029
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:56,080
in and update their talks so when we saw

1030
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:59,039
a bunch of very short abstracts coming

1031
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,279
in uh he said a note to everybody who

1032
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,960
had submitted so far and said if you

1033
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,320
think you could add a little bit of

1034
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
detail it would be greatly appreciated

1035
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,560
and so you know people were able to make

1036
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,560
those additions um

1037
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:11,599
before

1038
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:14,960
before we close the cfp

1039
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:16,320
we have another question i just want to

1040
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:17,760
put a plug out people on discord if you

1041
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,679
have questions we're watching too so

1042
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,560
yeah

1043
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,320
what's up gavin i see you out there oh

1044
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,320
yeah um first thing is if you're

1045
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,159
thinking about submitting a talk um i've

1046
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,599
seen a lot of people getting help from

1047
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,320
the main discord as everyone is super

1048
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,000
supportive and friendly so i highly

1049
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,520
recommend doing that i peruse that

1050
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,520
before submitting mine

1051
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,879
question is

1052
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,560
if i were to

1053
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,119
want to follow up with my talk what are

1054
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,480
some of the things that you would want

1055
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,599
to be

1056
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,520
looking for in order for it to be

1057
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,760
considered to be accepted

1058
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,520
when you say followed up with your talk

1059
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,440
like if you there's some areas of

1060
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,918
expansion that i wasn't able to get to

1061
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:56,079
in my talk so i want to do a follow-up

1062
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:59,359
with that oh sure and a year's worth of

1063
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:00,960
time is a good amount of time for me to

1064
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,960
be able to financially afford some of

1065
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,359
that cloud stuff so

1066
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,280
yeah i would put that in like your in

1067
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:09,920
your intro you know as a follow-on to my

1068
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,960
award-winning cactus content talk your

1069
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:15,200
title here okay maybe don't say award

1070
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,800
winning because we don't give out awards

1071
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,079
uh but

1072
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,920
you can mention like building on that

1073
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,640
expertise you know i

1074
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,520
let's

1075
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,520
i would i would definitely mention that

1076
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,240
if i pay for a black unicorn award do

1077
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:29,280
you think i could put that in there

1078
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,440
though we can discuss our terms after

1079
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,839
the mics go off thank you

1080
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:34,880
you know i think it's an interesting

1081
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,040
point because we did have uh a couple of

1082
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:38,800
part twos and part threes this year you

1083
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,560
know i think of like the the worst of

1084
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
cyber security series with with y'all

1085
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,880
grower and david where to uh they come

1086
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,599
back and do a killer job following up

1087
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,760
their talk uh we had the the purple team

1088
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,240
talk part two from from georgia she is

1089
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,240
this year so yeah those those part two

1090
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,839
talks are awesome especially if it was

1091
00:35:55,839 --> 00:35:57,680
an awesome part one talk

1092
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
yeah just make sure that we know it's a

1093
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,119
part two talk because we don't remember

1094
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:02,960
anything from minute to minute i don't

1095
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,240
even know what i'm doing up here

1096
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,280
actually

1097
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,920
i will say i've spectacularly failed on

1098
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
part twos um because i especially when i

1099
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,640
was first doing those types of talks

1100
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,839
i sort of assumed that people would go

1101
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:15,680
back and watch the youtube or whatever

1102
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
of my previous material and they didn't

1103
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,920
and then it would you know

1104
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,280
come in and be like starting a half of a

1105
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,280
novel and it's like okay

1106
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,960
i don't have the basis about you know

1107
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
rubber duckies to be able to follow

1108
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:28,800
along what's going on so

1109
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,760
i think doing a version two

1110
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
having a section where you sort of

1111
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
consolidate like what is important for

1112
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,480
you to know to carry you forward in the

1113
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,680
talk is you can never take for granted

1114
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
that people have seen your talks before

1115
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
that's really good to know because i

1116
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,079
would have done exactly that

1117
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,000
yeah it's tough i did i tried to do like

1118
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,599
a netcat series at a couple different

1119
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,200
conferences and then the first one was

1120
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
actually here it's quite good and the

1121
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,079
second one was a

1122
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:52,000
disaster because like so you all know

1123
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,599
how to do redirect pipes right we're

1124
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,880
just going to go from there people are

1125
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,680
like what is that

1126
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,480
from the discord

1127
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,079
everybody's just basically talking about

1128
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,880
how dc 480 is highly recommended there's

1129
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
another recommended talk that gavin

1130
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,599
dropped

1131
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:09,119
which which is interesting because yes

1132
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:11,119
there have been other talks about how to

1133
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:13,119
submit talks and you know we talked

1134
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:14,960
about being redundant but i think that

1135
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,680
the

1136
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,520
ability to have a new take or or some

1137
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,520
new information on it is important

1138
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,680
the other thing in discord uh

1139
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,280
in that question and answer section beep

1140
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,079
said cactus khan exclamation mark so

1141
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,800
gabe we agree with you totally

1142
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,359
and then one one other thing that this

1143
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:32,320
uh

1144
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,480
that someone posted a link the talky

1145
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,960
horror picture show overcoming cfp fears

1146
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,040
made me think of my you know initial

1147
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,640
fears submitting something i think a lot

1148
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,000
of us are

1149
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,320
not exactly extroverts so like getting

1150
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,839
in front of a bunch of a friend of

1151
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:46,800
people

1152
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,119
that would that was a sentence and uh

1153
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,119
presenting something can be really scary

1154
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:53,119
but also

1155
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:54,240
uh

1156
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,160
it's really rewarding or someone coming

1157
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:57,599
up after you and talking to you about

1158
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,119
something you're doing is really cool

1159
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:01,119
also i know undoubtedly it has helped

1160
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:03,119
career-wise that like when you're

1161
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,760
applying and you've got like a list of

1162
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,760
like talks and like your experience that

1163
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,240
goes to show to a business that you can

1164
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,040
you can present things and uh

1165
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
so so i think it's it's really

1166
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,400
worthwhile for your career and your

1167
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,880
development to to think about like how

1168
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,280
you how you can present

1169
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:24,240
yeah absolutely and i think for me

1170
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,160
i never really get used to it like i've

1171
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,839
probably given you know

1172
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:30,160
75 talks at different cons of different

1173
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,200
sizes and like before this panel

1174
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,720
i was sitting in the speaker lounge like

1175
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,480
think if i need to barf

1176
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,520
so you know it's never super comfortable

1177
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,720
but it's so worth it like i'm having a

1178
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,960
great time so

1179
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,800
you should get out there and really push

1180
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,000
yourself if you want to i'm not going to

1181
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,760
tell you how to live your life but just

1182
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,359
saying do what i want

1183
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:51,040
but yeah i mean and you can ask you can

1184
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:52,640
ask for feedback i've had people reach

1185
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:53,920
out and ask if i would review their

1186
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
submission and you know before the cfp

1187
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,560
you know before we do a review sure you

1188
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,200
know so feel free to

1189
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,640
paying people you know i'm happy to read

1190
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,839
something through and give

1191
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,560
recommendations um we can't re-review it

1192
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,320
after we've already made our decisions

1193
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,079
but yeah

1194
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:12,079
one of my favorite things to do is to

1195
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,800
hunt for bad talks and i'm not going to

1196
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,000
name names because that'd be a really

1197
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,839
rude thing to do but if you go on like

1198
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,839
iron geek regardless of iron geek's

1199
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,680
politics which i'm gonna have to ignore

1200
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,839
for a second but like

1201
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:25,680
there are some talks that are posted at

1202
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:28,960
like derby that are abysmal and so you

1203
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,640
watch a couple of those and right before

1204
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,000
you hit your cfp submission you're

1205
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:32,720
feeling real good

1206
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,560
[Laughter]

1207
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,680
all right we're going to need like a

1208
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:39,760
thread of bad talks it could be a secret

1209
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,800
we can

1210
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,040
that'll

1211
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,480
my first talk i did talk about uh scappy

1212
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,880
and so if anyone's not familiar it's a

1213
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,000
network

1214
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,280
framework for python allows you to

1215
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,520
generate packets roughly

1216
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,680
i submitted it was a lightning talk at

1217
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,520
actually besides 2012 that was before

1218
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,640
cactus con existed and i was so excited

1219
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,040
that i tried in 15 minutes to see like

1220
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,240
this is what scappy is this is what

1221
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,680
python is this is how you use it this is

1222
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,880
things you can do this is how you use it

1223
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,920
for red team this is how you use it for

1224
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,119
blue team this i use it for purple team

1225
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,160
which doesn't exist for another six

1226
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,839
years and it was just like

1227
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,079
terrible like i probably gave the worst

1228
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,839
talk in the history of infosec cons at

1229
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,599
least before 2015.

1230
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:18,960
and you know actually it was a good

1231
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,240
learning experience people were very

1232
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:25,280
educational occasionally nice

1233
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,960
um but it was it was good your first

1234
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,160
couple talks might be a little bit rough

1235
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,680
but that's okay you sort of shave the

1236
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,599
rough edges off i really encourage you

1237
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,920
to do it

1238
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,880
great any other questions

1239
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,599
