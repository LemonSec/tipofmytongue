of power we wanted to bring together

29
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,340
many stakeholders and kind of make

30
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:44,940
voices that are not often represented

31
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:47,340
here represented here we<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly felt</font>

that way I said in room full of

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,400

upon contrary to I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that</font>

436
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:09,428
<font color="#CCCCCC">perspectives and views of many of the</font>

437
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:14,999
people in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this room it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not something</font>

438
00:21:09,429 --> 00:21:17,350
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can necessarily support and so</font>

439
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:20,259
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not so sure whether the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is</font>

440
00:21:17,350 --> 00:21:25,600
actually the right place for rights con

441
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:27,549
next year on the other hand there's

442
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:30,340
never been a more important time<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

443
00:21:27,549 --> 00:21:33,429
a conference on<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights in America</font>

444
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:35,350
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a really really difficult</font>

445
00:21:33,429 --> 00:21:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">decision for us and we've been talking</font>

446
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:42,998
about it as a team and Nick and I have

447
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:45,610
been discussing it a lot so we started

448
00:21:42,999 --> 00:21:48,549
to talk with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canadian government and</font>

449
00:21:45,610 --> 00:21:50,379
we also talked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canadian partners many</font>

450
00:21:48,549 --> 00:21:53,850
of whom in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and asked them</font>

451
00:21:50,379 --> 00:22:02,289
about the possibility of hosting rad-con

452
00:21:53,850 --> 00:22:05,969
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada for next year and so wanted to</font>

453
00:22:02,289 --> 00:22:05,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">get your sense of like what you think</font>

454
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:29,120
so that the decision feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm on a</font>

455
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:39,370
reality television show and I never<font color="#E5E5E5"> even</font>

456
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:39,370
watched them it's it's easy yeah yeah

457
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:53,899
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> no no</font>

458
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:55,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">absolutely yeah I mean I think that the</font>

459
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:57,800
the fact that they're actually people

460
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:59,389
who cannot get a visa because of their

461
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:03,409
nationality and because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

462
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:06,080
religion it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of is a</font>

463
00:23:03,410 --> 00:23:07,970
different category of determination

464
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,280
diversity inclusion is an integral part

465
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:13,550
of this conference and it's difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

466
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:15,320
host a conference in a country that you

467
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:17,899
cannot have people in the audience

468
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:19,909
attend and so and so we're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

469
00:23:17,900 --> 00:23:21,710
that like you know having the

470
00:23:19,910 --> 00:23:22,850
discussions with the tech companies as

471
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:24,710
many of the guys mentioned is so

472
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:26,360
important but not<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually having</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

473
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:31,190
voices of the people that make up this

474
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:35,740
community so without further ado rates

475
00:23:31,190 --> 00:23:35,740
on 2018 Toronto
