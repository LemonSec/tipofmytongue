7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,320

welcome to the program i'm so excited to

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,359
talk to you because we're here to

12
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:30,560
celebrate

13
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,159
the 10th anniversary of the global

14
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,480
expansion of the organization right yeah

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,399
we are it's uh it's a really special

16
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
year for us actually because it was 10

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:40,640
years ago that change.org went from

18
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,360
being this very u.s centric uh petition

19
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:46,160
platform to really expanding globally

20
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,440
and

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
most people may not realize but signing

22
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,079
petitions is the most popular civic

23
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,440
action second only to voting

24
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,600
and so in the 10 years since then we've

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,520
seen more than 500 million people use

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,199
change.org around the world to sign

27
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,559
petitions on the things that they care

28
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,680
about

29
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,280
so much so that in a bunch of countries

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,520
whether it's the us or the uk or spain

31
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,439
we have almost as many people using

32
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,320
change.org as voters like more than 50

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,080
of the voting population are using

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,400
change.org on a regular basis

35
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
um and then just in the last couple of

36
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,200
years we expanded to africa and um right

37
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,799
now actually there's this massive

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,159
campaign that's taken off in south

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,439
africa

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,920
about energy and the energy crisis

41
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,360
that's happening there

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,520
and so all around the world we've seen

43
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
this explosion of activity of people

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,920
using this simple accessible tool to

45
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,439
take action on issues they care about

46
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,280
and we're taking this year as 10 years

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,040
since we started that process to just

48
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,240
celebrate that

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
awesome now with petitions i think um

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,680
how do you take a petition and and see

51
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
the impact you know beyond the online

52
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,159
signing i mean some people can be quite

53
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,759
critical it's just signing

54
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,960
you know putting your signature on

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,799
something and then nothing happens after

56
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,040
that but what are you seeing yeah so i

57
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,000
think there's a little bit of a

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
misconception that petitions don't work

59
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,439
and that's not at all our experience um

60
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,280
literally every hour there are campaigns

61
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
winning on the platform just through

62
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,038
people adding their voice telling their

63
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:14,640
story through this very simple tool now

64
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,720
i think in some ways the advent of

65
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,959
online organizing came from the simple

66
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:21,599
insight that signing a petition could

67
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,560
also act as a sign up form for further

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,599
action

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,160
and so what we see is that petitions are

70
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
they're kind of containers they're a way

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,840
in which a group of people who have a

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,319
shared set of values or a shared goal

73
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,560
can come together but then organize

74
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
together on what additional actions are

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,319
going to make the most difference

76
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:43,200
and so frequently we see

77
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,640
thousands of people come together within

78
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,239
a petition but then using that as a

79
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
forum to identify what's the next action

80
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,560
to take where are we meeting up in

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,879
person who are we calling

82
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,040
um how are we lobbying the decision

83
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,360
makers and they're the campaigns that

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,599
are most successful

85
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,000
now i think the problem is

86
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,800
activism as a whole and i've been

87
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,400
working in activism and i guess

88
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,319
volunteering and activism for uh pretty

89
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,599
much all of my life at this point i

90
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
think the same barriers exist today as

91
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
have for a really long time which is

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,360
it takes a lot of time

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,120
it takes a lot of money

94
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,640
you've got to have the like

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,959
privilege to be able to invest time in

96
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,959
activism and organize it often happens

97
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:26,080
outside of somebody's job absolutely

98
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,440
and

99
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,680
and it requires a you know it's not

100
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,120
clear how it works it's very

101
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
inaccessible

102
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,920
it's not clear how to be successful

103
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,840
requires education knowledge various

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,040
things and so

105
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,720
we are constantly looking at well how

106
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,799
can we make this more accessible what

107
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:44,640
are the barriers that we can lower by

108
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,040
taking all of what we learn about what

109
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
makes for effective campaigning making

110
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
that accessible to people through

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,239
personal coaches through

112
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,720
training and education but also

113
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,280
exploring ways for people to be able to

114
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,439
like earn money to be sustainable in

115
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
their activism as well so the petition

116
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,680
is really very much a starting point

117
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,239
it's like a gateway drug

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,680
a nice gateway drug exactly um so what

119
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,760
has changed over the last 10 years in

120
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,519
terms of how you're seeing this process

121
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,959
play out

122
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:16,399
what was it like 10 years ago when

123
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:17,759
people signed up for a petition and what

124
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,358
happened versus now and how are they

125
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,079
using technology to leverage things yeah

126
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,520
so i think

127
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,000
there's never been a better moment

128
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,280
in time for people to have more agency

129
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,840
and voice through using technology

130
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,600
whether petitions or actually social

131
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,880
media and other

132
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,199
technology evolutions to organize

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,280
quickly and

134
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,199
i think that like covert actually

135
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,960
provides a really good example of this

136
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,320
so

137
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,520
on change.org we saw this explosion of

138
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,759
campaigns like hundreds thousands of

139
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,440
campaigns looking

140
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,360
at the advent of covert like how to

141
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,680
protect and support different industries

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,919
hundreds thousands of campaigns how to

143
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
make sure that healthcare workers had

144
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,000
access to ppe and other forms of

145
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
security hundreds thousands of campaigns

146
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,000
around vaccine access and things like

147
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:06,960
that

148
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,960
and that was a moment in time in which i

149
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
think institutions

150
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,720
were struggling to react fast enough

151
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,360
like that the centralized coordinated

152
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,039
approach to that rapidly changing

153
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
environment simply couldn't keep up with

154
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
the set of needs and so on change we saw

155
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,520
people like breaking that problem down

156
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,199
into all of these different micro

157
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,280
solutions and then organizing around

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
those and we saw that happen off change

159
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,080
as well like

160
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,080
mutual aid groups springing up

161
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,240
and other forms of collective organizing

162
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,880
that involve individuals and communities

163
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
self self-organizing to identify

164
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,880
solutions and improve things so super

165
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,280
busy period the last two years not much

166
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,919
uh bread baking for you definitely

167
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,240
definitely vein a busy figures

168
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,560
amazing and so um

169
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,199
can you talk about what is uh happening

170
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,800
right now

171
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,400
something that's coming up a lot in the

172
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
last 24 hours of this summit is of

173
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,960
course uh russia's invasion of ukraine

174
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,440
um how are you seeing

175
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,759
that play out on your platform yeah so i

176
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
don't know about you but certainly

177
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,360
around when that first happened i felt

178
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,479
this incredible sense of like

179
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,360
powerlessness frustration anger like

180
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
yeah absolutely how can we do something

181
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,520
like what an awful situation you know

182
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,600
you're just sitting there watching the

183
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,160
tanks roll towards kiev and you're

184
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,600
concerned that

185
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
i mean there was a moment when everyone

186
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,199
was concerned that the president of

187
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,120
ukraine was just going to be killed and

188
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,600
we're all just watching absolutely and

189
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,520
so we saw this like explosion of people

190
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,360
like trying to find a way to

191
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,759
constructively challenge their like fear

192
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,000
and hope in that situation

193
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,919
so constructively channel

194
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:44,880
challenge

195
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,240
and

196
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,039
uh

197
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
that led to a mixture of things so

198
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,720
you have these like

199
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,039
one-off big breakout moments so one

200
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,919
example in russia an anti-war activist

201
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
started a petition

202
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,199
that really ended up being a central

203
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,080
focal point for anti-war

204
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,919
expression in russia at the time more

205
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,599
than 1.2 million russians signed that

206
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,039
campaign

207
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,880
and it became a

208
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,440
mechanism and voice for people inside

209
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,919
russia to express their

210
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,120
their kind of frustration in this

211
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
situation and oppose the war

212
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,759
but outside of that we also saw this

213
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,080
phenomenon of these like thousands of

214
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,960
micro actions that people might take so

215
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,560
we saw thousands of campaigns that were

216
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,440
about

217
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,479
how can we

218
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,160
make it easier for refugees to get into

219
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,160
this particular country um we saw

220
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,919
thousands of campaigns that were about

221
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,080
welcoming those refugees or about

222
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,680
ensuring that there was aid going to

223
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,520
different groups and so

224
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
um what we're seeing in response to

225
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,240
moments like that is not one silver

226
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,639
bullet campaign where people think that

227
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,319
one particular movement or one

228
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,160
particular petition or any one thing is

229
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,240
going to solve that problem i don't

230
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
think people are that naive right but

231
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,759
what they are doing is they're trying to

232
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,840
take that big problem break it down into

233
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,199
a whole bunch of smaller component

234
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
bite-sized pieces that you can then make

235
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
a difference on in your local community

236
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,280
and that honestly is the thing that

237
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,720
gives me the most hope in those

238
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
situations

239
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,840
i actually want to go back to one of the

240
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,160
examples you gave of russians signing a

241
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,160
petition against the war here's a

242
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
question what about protecting those

243
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,840
people in the security i'm sure you guys

244
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,240
think about about it people sign their

245
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,560
names onto list at the time

246
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,280
it

247
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,120
made sense and

248
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,280
if they're in a semi-authoritarian state

249
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,360
that decides to start going after people

250
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,960
on that list how does change deal with

251
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,440
that yeah it's a great question so

252
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,440
uh we operate

253
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
across a bunch of different contexts

254
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,880
both democratic as well as

255
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,559
semi-democratic as well as kind of

256
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:43,519
authoritarian and so we

257
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,680
have a set of protections in place in

258
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,560
those

259
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:50,320
markets where we anonymize and make

260
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,240
secure a bunch of personal information

261
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,320
so whereas in a us market what you might

262
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,200
see is you see all the list of names and

263
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,640
like that people putting their public

264
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
persona against a campaign in russia

265
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,519
what you would say is just the aggregate

266
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:04,959
like you see the number of people taking

267
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,600
action but um we kind of strip away the

268
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,839
ability to identify any one person

269
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
within it

270
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,120
super interesting

271
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
the other thing that i'm wondering is um

272
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,200
since a decade ago my own observation is

273
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,399
that

274
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,959
activism happens in different countries

275
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
but there's a transnational thing going

276
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,240
on like point of reference is um in asia

277
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,959
with the milk tea alliance a funny name

278
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,440
but it was a way for young protesters a

279
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,839
lot of them students in hong kong

280
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,040
myanmar thailand indonesia to start

281
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:41,200
communicating with each other

282
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
to try to

283
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,920
you know it's a strength and numbers

284
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
thing that people were recognizing are

285
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,920
you seeing more of that um through

286
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,160
change.org as well yeah absolutely and i

287
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,000
think it's a really good example because

288
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,240
i think looking 10 years ago i think

289
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,880
there may have been a

290
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,279
optimism that there was the potential

291
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,600
for these unifying transnational

292
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
movements that would be like you know

293
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,519
put pressure on international

294
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,079
governments to see climate action and

295
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,440
you know one big campaign might be a um

296
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,920
a global cry to

297
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,920
force a change of some kind and that's

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,320
not really how we're seeing it play out

299
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,640
we see transnational movements that

300
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,640
share values

301
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,000
and goals

302
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,200
but which

303
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,519
take those values and goals and

304
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,680
customize them for their local context

305
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,120
and figure out what the right expression

306
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,959
is for those contexts and that are

307
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
inspired by each other and support each

308
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,560
other with lessons with learnings with

309
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,160
things like that but which are not

310
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,760
working on fundamentally the same

311
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,440
specific campaign

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,200
an example of this would be in 2020

313
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
we saw thousands of campaigns in the u.s

314
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
focused on uh representation around

315
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,200
racial justice monuments so

316
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,760
thousands of monuments to slave owners

317
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,600
in the u.s that were kind of held up and

318
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,680
glorified in different local communities

319
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,600
and so we saw hundreds and thousands of

320
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,279
campaigns that were about changing that

321
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,360
representation and taking those down

322
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,000
that inspired a set of similar campaigns

323
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
that basically started copycatting

324
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,120
copycatting and learning from what was

325
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,800
happening that we saw spread across the

326
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
world in the uk i remember and

327
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,200
absolutely and the same thing happened

328
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
another example uh in many uh in many

329
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,360
contexts

330
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,079
um women's sanitary products are taxed

331
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,640
in a way so tampon taxes as an example

332
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:30,399
and so we saw this big campaign in the

333
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:32,959
uk where um there was this huge movement

334
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,480
that was about getting the tampon tax

335
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,079
removed that started before the united

336
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,680
states that did start before the united

337
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,200
states that's right and that campaign

338
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,959
very much inspired

339
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:43,120
copycat campaigns across first across

340
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,160
rest of europe and then on a

341
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,240
state-by-state basis in the us

342
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,040
and

343
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,959
those campaigners were talking to each

344
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,079
other right there's like literally a

345
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,760
whatsapp group in which folks are

346
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,600
sharing lessons celebrating each other's

347
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
victories and being inspired by what's

348
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,839
working in different context contexts

349
00:11:57,839 --> 00:11:59,920
and countries and that i think is the

350
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
future of like transnational activism

351
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,000
it's not about one unifying big campaign

352
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
that everyone is working on it's about

353
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,760
shared goals and shared values and then

354
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,440
sharing lessons and being inspired by

355
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
that and supporting each other in the

356
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,040
way that it gets taken forwards how is

357
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,880
that different than like i'm just as

358
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,639
you're talking i'm thinking about like

359
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
the arab spring where there was also

360
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,639
transnational communication how is it

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,079
different now than

362
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,839
back then i mean you answered it a

363
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:25,920
little bit about you know each group

364
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,600
understanding that they have to focus on

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,200
their own theme and their shared values

366
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,120
but are you seeing

367
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,839
anything else in terms of like how they

368
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,399
implement technology or

369
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,720
so on yeah i mean i think the themes are

370
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,399
still there from the arab spring which

371
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,160
is that like

372
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,320
uh decentralization of communication

373
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,240
enables that sharing of information and

374
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:47,600
that inspiration

375
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
um from each other but the mechanisms

376
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,360
through which that happens are changing

377
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,560
and so

378
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,639
uh you know these days rather than

379
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,399
necessarily twitter being the thing in

380
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,320
which the arab spring is like sharing

381
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,240
that information now you have the rise

382
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:04,079
of like tick-tock communicators who are

383
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:06,720
telling stories and figuring out how to

384
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,440
make information about the ukraine like

385
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
digestible

386
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
easily accessible and distributable to a

387
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,440
really large audience and so i think the

388
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,920
mechanisms are changing i think things

389
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,839
like whatsapp things like whether it's

390
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,480
discord or slack that are enabling

391
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
um coordination across context and

392
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
sharing of lessons

393
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,279
is new and evolving as well great uh

394
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,760
we're gonna go to questions very soon so

395
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,399
if you haven't um you've been shy in the

396
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,560
chat box definitely start submitting

397
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
your questions and we'll get to as many

398
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,440
as possible but i want to

399
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,440
maybe wrap up this part of the segment

400
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,760
with a couple of big picture questions

401
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
um

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,440
it's been a little depressing sometimes

403
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,639
to see

404
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,959
uh people power movements essentially

405
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,160
not work out we see this with hong kong

406
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,839
we saw that there was such an

407
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,000
expectation from the people of belarus

408
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,399
that the world would stand with them and

409
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,680
to an extent they have um but

410
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
they didn't get perhaps the kind of help

411
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,240
they needed or

412
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,199
in any case the movement was crushed

413
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,360
you see this it's just slightly

414
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,199
different but in kazakhstan earlier this

415
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,880
year um

416
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,199
i can go on and on right

417
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,360
in southeast asia the thai students came

418
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,639
out during covid and kept coming out and

419
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,120
so i mean it feels sometimes like none

420
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,000
of it is working as someone who

421
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,760
sits there and deals with all this looks

422
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,680
at the petitions look at all the

423
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,959
activism in all these different

424
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:39,760
countries what would you say

425
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,959
i mean

426
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:42,880
unfortunately advocacy activism

427
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,160
campaigning it's just not a linear

428
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,639
process

429
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,880
my experience i think back to one of the

430
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,800
first big kind of organizing efforts

431
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,399
that i worked and volunteered on which

432
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,800
was about trying to increase australia's

433
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
aid and development budget

434
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,440
and after this blood sweat and tears of

435
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,279
nine months of campaign working on this

436
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,760
we secured a commitment to increase

437
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,600
australia's development budget by about

438
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,120
three billion dollars which felt like

439
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,440
this huge win right and then three years

440
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,279
later new government comes in cuts it

441
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,120
immediately right and so it was just

442
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,560
this devastating moment and and

443
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,160
constantly i think advocacy and

444
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,760
campaigning is very much two steps

445
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
forward one steps back and you can never

446
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,120
know when a

447
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,360
when the groundwork that a campaign has

448
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,720
laid

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,800
can find fertile

450
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,040
ground when context changes yeah it

451
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
often feels like it's happening very

452
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,600
quickly but actually a lot of people

453
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,240
have been investing decades totally i

454
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,360
mean i think you see in a bunch of

455
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,360
countries right now what has felt like

456
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,160
zero progress at all on climate

457
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:44,720
suddenly context changes and something

458
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,639
new is possible the same is true

459
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,639
actually on covert where

460
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,199
for decades people had been working on

461
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,880
mental health issues

462
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
and then covert put a focus on that that

463
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,680
meant a huge number of national

464
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,399
governments um invested in mental health

465
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,000
in a way that they had never done done

466
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,920
before and the only reason that was

467
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,839
possible was because there'd been

468
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,519
decades of pre-work that had felt like

469
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,519
it wasn't going anywhere right and then

470
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,600
suddenly it was possible and there was

471
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,399
this huge leak forwards excellent okay

472
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,680
so let's go to questions uh we have one

473
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
from carolyn

474
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,759
how have you seen people use change.org

475
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,680
to innovate beyond the traditional

476
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,279
petition format

477
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,519
yeah so this is a great question um

478
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,120
one thing that we're seeing at the

479
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,320
moment is the rise of what i will call

480
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,440
the like individual civic leader

481
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,839
influencer type and what i mean by this

482
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,199
is

483
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,639
if we go back a few decades

484
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,480
most organizing and activism was

485
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,759
much of it was led from within

486
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,160
institutions organizations non-profits

487
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,160
that were

488
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,600
kind of building durable power and

489
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,600
organizing that or organizing on that

490
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,639
over time

491
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,959
and what we're seeing now is these

492
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,519
individuals who are have powerful

493
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,959
personal stories

494
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:05,919
who

495
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:08,319
are compelling communicators

496
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,319
and who have like really innovative

497
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,160
theories of change and diverse ways of

498
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,480
looking at a problem building audiences

499
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
and brands almost like as individuals

500
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,240
that are then being very compelling

501
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,720
public communicators around it like the

502
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:21,439
most

503
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,760
obvious example is like greta at a at an

504
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,599
international level but

505
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,599
i think across every issue you're seeing

506
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,880
more and more of these people who are

507
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,080
building an audience as an individual

508
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
finding their voice

509
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
um and having an incredibly important

510
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,280
impact on the way that the public is

511
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,600
perceiving an issue and so petitions are

512
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:43,200
like one way to build that audience and

513
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,880
to start to

514
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,520
cut through um but people are then

515
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,679
leveraging that audience into

516
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:51,760
things like additional actions that

517
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,679
their supporters can take one thing that

518
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,160
we're working on is how people can take

519
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,240
that and turn that into having durable

520
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,960
income actually because the biggest um

521
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,640
barrier to being able to do more of that

522
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,799
work is time and money to what you said

523
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
at the very beginning exactly so that's

524
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,160
something that we're working on as well

525
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,440
and that's something we're very excited

526
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,120
about cool awesome so next question

527
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,520
uh what has change.org learned um

528
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,679
and shared about the impact of petitions

529
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,840
and other advocacy tools have in

530
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,480
persuading dece okay so yeah and if you

531
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,880
can provide some examples of when um

532
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,360
petitions have persuaded decision makers

533
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,720
to change course

534
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,120
so i think that there's a couple of

535
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,280
ways in which this happens so the first

536
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,240
is

537
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,039
um

538
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,039
a petition can spotlight an issue that a

539
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,720
decision maker just simply wasn't aware

540
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,720
of this happens surprisingly frequently

541
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,480
decision makers have a hard job right

542
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,919
they're balancing all sorts of different

543
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,200
things

544
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,039
and so by simply calling attention to an

545
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,360
issue and spotlighting it that's enough

546
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
to kind of lead to some sort of change

547
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,600
often though it's the addition of two

548
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,200
things that make the most difference so

549
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
the first is the personal stories behind

550
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,360
the person who organized the petition

551
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,280
and the signatures behind it as well

552
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,799
it's kind of not enough just to be like

553
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:09,120
oh there's a nameless one person who

554
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,720
added their name to this instead it's

555
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,320
about hearing about the personal story

556
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,720
of like why this matters

557
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,400
and that

558
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,799
turning abstract numbers of petition

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,919
signatures into real stories

560
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,919
of how people are affected by different

561
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:25,840
issues is extremely compelling to

562
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,240
decision makers the second thing is to

563
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,320
help focus the activities of those

564
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,320
signatures into additional actions like

565
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,000
calling the decision maker showing up to

566
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,160
events right those are the additional

567
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:39,520
things that also make petitions really

568
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,400
powerful cool all right well

569
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,679
um

570
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,480
colin asks can you talk about trust and

571
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:48,720
safety at change.org what's the main

572
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,039
trend of user-generated content you are

573
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,480
fighting against

574
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,840
that's a good question it's a great

575
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,640
question and it varies it changes a lot

576
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,240
over time and changes a lot by different

577
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
national context

578
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:01,679
we

579
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,000
try to balance three things um we want

580
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,640
our community to be empowering

581
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,480
open and safe

582
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,000
in the way that we

583
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,919
uh essentially protect our safe space

584
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,720
for people to have a voice

585
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,039
the biggest trend um

586
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,320
over the last few years was obviously

587
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,679
covered yep

588
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:20,559
where

589
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,840
we had to

590
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,400
react really fast honestly to try and

591
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,840
make sure that things weren't that

592
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,440
wasn't misinformation spreading through

593
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
the platform

594
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,000
and

595
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,440
i'm really proud of the way that our

596
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,720
trust and safety team worked on that

597
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,320
actually we acted much faster than many

598
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,960
of the other like tech platforms on this

599
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,880
um can you give an example i mean just

600
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,159
like what kind of misinformation

601
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,400
somebody was trying to petition yeah so

602
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,919
like uh

603
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,320
vaccine safety is a good example of this

604
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,200
right

605
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
where um there was a bunch of

606
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,120
misinformation or i don't know 5g bill

607
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,240
gate like there's all sorts of

608
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,799
conspiracy theories out there that um

609
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,799
were that we had to act really fast on

610
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:58,240
to try and make sure that we were not

611
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,240
being a kind of platform for them

612
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,280
excellent

613
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,679
uh cool so lots of questions this is

614
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,280
awesome i think this is the most we've

615
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,760
had for in in conversation donna is

616
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,520
asking is email still a functional and

617
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,840
worthwhile channel for digital activism

618
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:14,080
i mean

619
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,760
people have been predicting the death of

620
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,799
email for like 15 20 years right exactly

621
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,840
i still find it useful exactly

622
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:22,799
so

623
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
a huge amount of number of our community

624
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,039
regularly find out about um the

625
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,480
campaigns that they can support through

626
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,200
the email channel so um we kind of have

627
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,120
somewhere in the range of a billion

628
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,720
recommendations a month going out to

629
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,720
different members of our community um

630
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,799
with email as a primary channel

631
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,559
it's definitely

632
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:43,440
not as effective as it used to be

633
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,520
but there's not a better alternative

634
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
like the alternative is to try and be is

635
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
to kind of put yourself at the whims of

636
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,039
the algorithms of various social media

637
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,240
platforms

638
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,240
you know some people are building up sms

639
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
platforms um but that's expensive and it

640
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,039
costs a lot of money to distribute so

641
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,080
even though email has declined in

642
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,960
absolute value it's still i think

643
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,120
one of the best channels for any

644
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,919
organization um organizing community of

645
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,280
people to be investing in yeah and

646
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:12,799
there's a second life now with the

647
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,559
popularity of newsletters yeah

648
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:17,039
absolutely are you guys involved in that

649
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,280
kind of um yeah i mean that's it kind of

650
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,200
goes to this uh

651
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,000
uh

652
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,760
trend that i that i was talking about

653
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,320
before of these individual like leaders

654
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,760
who are

655
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,200
kind of building up profiles by

656
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:31,200
themselves not not associated with

657
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,080
organizations often they're doing that

658
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,159
by building up audiences through email

659
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:37,919
newsletters we see them using platforms

660
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,840
like sub stack or patreon or things like

661
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,720
that

662
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,080
so that's very much something that we're

663
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,480
looking to enable as well very cool

664
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,039
okay next question let's see

665
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,600
laura says after 10 years of emails and

666
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,360
petitions emails again

667
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,440
what trends will we be talking about in

668
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,080
organizing technology 10 years from now

669
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,840
and i think that's kind of like what's

670
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,960
the future of change.org right yeah so i

671
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,840
couldn't be more excited about this

672
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,400
um that the new voices that are coming

673
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
to the table as a result of this

674
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,200
of this disaggregation and

675
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,720
decentralization of the the new civic

676
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,559
leaders that are finding their voice

677
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
these are the greta's the malalas

678
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,840
parkland

679
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,280
students um

680
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,960
again and again we're seeing these kind

681
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,720
of new leaders emerging and i think that

682
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
that's something that is incredibly

683
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,039
um exciting it's bringing a more diverse

684
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:34,720
set of voices to the table it is

685
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,640
bringing a more diverse set of like

686
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,880
theories of change for how you create

687
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,799
change in the world it's not about using

688
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,960
the same old tactics that like a small

689
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
set of organizations have used forever

690
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,840
um and i think that trend is only going

691
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
to continue i think that

692
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,240
in the same way

693
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,440
we are seeing in media

694
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,000
this trend of

695
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,000
journalists essentially

696
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,000
becoming

697
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,320
production companies themselves

698
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,080
individuals they become brands they

699
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,159
become brands we're going to see that in

700
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,159
in activism and organizing and i think

701
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,840
that that's going to lead to a much more

702
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:13,440
diverse set of voices at the table and a

703
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,880
much more diverse set of theories of

704
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:17,039
change for how um different issues get

705
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,200
taken forwards that's something that i'm

706
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
incredibly excited about

707
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,039
the other um

708
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,919
kind of big trend i think is

709
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,520
in 10 years time

710
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,279
i don't know about you but i'm i'm

711
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,440
overwhelmed when i think about how can i

712
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,080
personally take action on climate change

713
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,600
yes yes

714
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,520
like there are a thousand petitions

715
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,440
signed there are 100 000 organizations

716
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,279
to donate to

717
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,600
and there's a lot of noise

718
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,039
and that is

719
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,679
both exciting because

720
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,600
i can look through everything and i can

721
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,120
go here is an organization doing

722
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,720
something i'm incredibly inspired by

723
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,240
they're based in africa they've

724
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,400
organized organizing on the ground and i

725
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,919
can back them directly and be connected

726
00:24:57,919 --> 00:24:59,360
to them directly in a way that wasn't

727
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,200
possible before so that's like the

728
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,279
exciting part the hard part is that's

729
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,320
really overwhelming there's a lot of

730
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:06,559
noise to cut through and do you think

731
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:08,480
that's the big challenge for for

732
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,240
change.org i mean it's something that

733
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,440
we're definitely thinking about how we

734
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,080
can help our users with which is out of

735
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,760
all of the opportunities that are out

736
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
there which one is like most relevant

737
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,840
for you and how do you cut through and

738
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:21,360
identify the things that are most

739
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,480
impactful

740
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,000
um and i think there's a lot of other

741
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,840
really interesting organizations doing

742
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,080
similar things that are essentially

743
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
solving the problem of identifying the

744
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,159
most impactful action that you can take

745
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,600
givewell i think is actually a really

746
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,279
good example i don't know if your the

747
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,039
audience knows about this but they do

748
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,880
really great work looking through all of

749
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:42,480
the organizations that are doing work to

750
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,960
fight extreme poverty essentially

751
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,840
and

752
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,600
saying out of all of the possible

753
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,520
opportunities to donate

754
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,760
what has the highest impact

755
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,440
right and saying like here are the top

756
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
three here's where we think your money

757
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,120
should go and as a result of their

758
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,640
recommendations literally hundreds of

759
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,919
millions of dollars get channeled

760
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,200
towards these highly effective

761
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,039
organizations and i think we're going to

762
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,880
see more of that over time not just for

763
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:07,360
donations but also for advocacy actions

764
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,200
also for volunteering right but it's

765
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:10,400
about helping people cut through the

766
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
noise and identify what is most

767
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,799
impactful for them personally got it

768
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:17,200
i think we have time for just one

769
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,279
question so let me check and um

770
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,760
and you know what i'm gonna end on on

771
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,159
asking you about the biggest challenge

772
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,400
that you think change.org is going to be

773
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,880
facing in the next decade what's the

774
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,240
thing that really kind of worries you

775
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,760
and say oh we need to really work on

776
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:37,679
that and make sure that this works yeah

777
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,440
so

778
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,200
this might be a slightly wonky answer

779
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,480
but we have increasing amounts of

780
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,159
attention

781
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:47,039
and

782
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,080
time

783
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:51,919
being captured and utilized by

784
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,440
essentially monopoly technology

785
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,840
platforms that are very closed gardens i

786
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,520
mean you mentioned tick-tock i mean

787
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,919
tick-tock is a great great activist

788
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,760
uh you know communicating there but you

789
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,320
can also just spend six hours watching

790
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,440
watching

791
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,440
i don't know people dancing which is

792
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,279
great but and they're very closed

793
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
ecosystems right like i think if we go

794
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,000
back to a previous iteration of the

795
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
internet and the technology

796
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,799
um

797
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,799
people would coordinate but they would

798
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:20,320
also post links they would share

799
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,840
opportunities for action and it was very

800
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,440
possible to go out and take action

801
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,600
somewhere else as a result

802
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,159
instagram tick tock some of the most

803
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,240
popular technology platforms these days

804
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,080
snapchat is another good example are

805
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,600
very focused around keeping you within

806
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,960
the ecosystem

807
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,279
um which can be great for education

808
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,120
content and so on but makes it really

809
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,880
hard to

810
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,039
inspire people to take action elsewhere

811
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,399
and i think that's something both for us

812
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,559
but also the industry more broadly we

813
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,399
need to be really careful of

814
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,039
because it's going to be increasingly

815
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,360
hard on those platforms to get people to

816
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,200
take action outside of them

817
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,080
and that i think is a challenge for us

818
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,919
and for everyone to overcome

819
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:02,559
well on that note nick thank you so much

820
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
for joining us in the studio i hope

821
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,320
everyone out there thought that was a

822
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,880
fantastic talk i certainly learned a lot

823
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,320
have a good day and stay engaged
