as many of them as possible

44
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,079
let's get started

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,840
since we're talking about whistleblowers

46
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,320
today let's begin with sophie who has

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
the experience of being one first hand

48
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,920
sophie what made you decide you wanted

49
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,919
to become a whistleblower and once you

50
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,520
made that decision

51
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,040
how did you figure out the course

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,360
forward could you talk about those early

53
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
months early weeks with us

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,480
absolutely it was never an immediate

55
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
decision rather

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
rather it was the gradual one in which i

57
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
i tried very hard to solve problems

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
within the system and when that failed i

59
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,080
always escalated one step further

60
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,720
first first to facebook leadership then

61
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,040
to all facebook employees then to the

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,080
press then to the to the government and

63
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,040
then

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,280
and every time it failed i went one step

65
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:48,400
further

66
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,120
for instance where's my work in india

67
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,920
the the the indian speaker has re has

68
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,760
refused to withdraw my testimony for the

69
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,640
past six months so actually

70
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,800
last night which would be this morning

71
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,599
in india i came forward with a group of

72
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,599
several dozen indian outlets to publish

73
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,440
the same documentation i had offered to

74
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,120
the indian government

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,720
so it's always a work in progress

76
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,879
great we will come about talk about the

77
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,800
the india issue later but bringing jon

78
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,720
into the conversation john sophie just

79
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,599
alluded to her experience in brief uh do

80
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,200
you think there are aspects of being a

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,599
whistleblower in the non-western world

82
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:31,840
that are unique to say in kenya where

83
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,760
you work very closely

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
any unique challenges that you've seen

85
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,599
for whistleblowers if it's harder much

86
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
harder maybe

87
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,599
well

88
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:42,319
in

89
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:45,680
in many developing countries

90
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,040
the the elites are small

91
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,480
and they're intertwined whether they

92
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,560
talk about the political economic

93
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,799
social elites are very intertwined and

94
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,239
therefore when one is blowing the

95
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,400
whistle

96
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,480
one is invariably also blowing the

97
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,200
whistle on people with whom they have a

98
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,879
relationship could be friends could be

99
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,239
even relatives

100
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,400
and um and so it it it has a the social

101
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,120
sanction impact of blowing the whistle

102
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,760
is is particularly stuck

103
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,440
in those kind of circumstances

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,079
right uh the defeat both the other

105
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,960
speakers sort of alluded to why what is

106
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,479
difficult for whistleblowers but just to

107
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,199
set the tone for this conversation

108
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
why do you think the world needs

109
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,199
whistleblowers i mean to my opinion

110
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,680
right now more than ever before but if

111
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,479
you could share your thoughts on that

112
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,479
yeah thank you thank you so much again

113
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,440
thank you to all of you uh so the world

114
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
needs we saw blurs more than ever that

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
definitely i agree with you basically as

116
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,240
you we know all know tech has a growing

117
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,040
presence in our life in our any aspect

118
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,880
of our life from the education to our

119
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,520
children to how we will check our

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,039
heartbeats whatsoever and basically as

121
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,759
uh as some of us know if without the

122
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
whistleblowers we have no idea what's

123
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
happening inside the tech companies who

124
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,199
know so much things about us so

125
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,680
basically the whistleblowers are the

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,039
emergency brakes the only one

127
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,960
that we can have to know what is

128
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,000
happening

129
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,440
uh and and because the lawmakers are not

130
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,560
keeping up

131
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,360
uh and not are not holding uh these

132
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,919
powerful companies to the right level of

133
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
transparency and so the whistleblowers

134
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,919
are the courageous individuals who are

135
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:44,400
bringing public interest information to

136
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,800
the public without them we could not

137
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,759
know

138
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,039
what is happening uh inside facebook

139
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,479
inside

140
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,520
any companies that are

141
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,000
that have huge powers

142
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,880
and

143
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,680
huge knowledge about each of us so

144
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,039
that's why

145
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,440
we saw blowers are immensely important

146
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:09,280
in this tech age uh in the past we saw

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,400
bloors where

148
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,319
were playing a huge role to fight

149
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,039
corruption or to fight environmental

150
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,240
scandals and it is still the case but um

151
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,360
in in the tech era they are definitely

152
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
more important than ever as as as

153
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,840
workers are building unions as lawmakers

154
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,319
are trying to keep up it's the we saw

155
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,960
blowers are playing a full um part in

156
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,759
this important

157
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,520
issue

158
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,520
so just before we started we were all

159
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,120
discussing with sophie about you know

160
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,600
what kind of support system she has and

161
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,440
i was asking sophie how she coordinates

162
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,840
with the media et

163
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,160
i was surprised to hear what i heard but

164
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
sophie could you tell us about you know

165
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,680
the kind of support you have received

166
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,160
from say human rights defenders

167
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,120
journalists civil society actors

168
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
legal aid etc so far

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,280
you don't have a pr team

170
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
that you know

171
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,639
yes so so absolutely like i've received

172
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:11,280
i've received a lot of uh praise and

173
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,919
praise and kind words from people and

174
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
journal and journalists are often happy

175
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,039
to

176
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,919
to interview me

177
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,960
and and and ngos and civil society are

178
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,039
some of my closest partners for instance

179
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,520
they helped for instance i work closely

180
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,360
with several

181
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,120
groups in india to help contact

182
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,639
reporters and and and and advise me on

183
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,560
how to do things with regards to coming

184
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,120
forward with india but i don't have a pr

185
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,000
team or really

186
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,639
a closely integrated team the way that

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
some others do and and

188
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
frank frankly i think that's the

189
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
difference the difference in approach

190
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,000
when i came forward at the start i

191
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,720
didn't have i didn't have support and i

192
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,560
took a very naive

193
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,599
yolo approach of or just figure it out

194
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,400
and

195
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,879
and say what i say what i know and some

196
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,639
part will work out and well it didn't

197
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,720
quite but

198
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,840
but by now it's actually my brand to be

199
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,960
unscripted and

200
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,000
and fairly open and earnest and talk to

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,160
basically everyone who listens and

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
that's a brand that does not work too

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
well with typical pr firms or etc

204
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,319
for instance for instance i i i tried

205
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:28,080
discussing with several groups getting

206
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
potential pr support before before

207
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,240
coming forward in india but there were

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,799
philosophical discrete disagreements for

209
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,799
instance some people and i'm not going

210
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,120
to mention who i mean some people wanted

211
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
the ability to make statements on my

212
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,039
behalf some people wanted the ability to

213
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,920
turn down interviews with small authors

214
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
that they believed were insufficiently

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,959
important so they could save it as

216
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,720
exclusives for the larger ones and

217
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,560
that's what i've done and i completely

218
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,399
understand how that that's how publicity

219
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,160
is supposed to work but

220
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
i'm um i mean in so much as i have a

221
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,920
brand

222
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
right now it's doing it's doing the

223
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,279
opposite of that and they sort of want

224
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
you to keep and nurture that

225
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,399
and

226
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,720
and any anyway and

227
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,720
and this might not be the ideal way but

228
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,880
i think it offers something unique to

229
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,440
have me approaching it from this angle

230
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,480
for instance i i often hear criticism of

231
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,880
francis falcon that's for instance that

232
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,360
she's too prepared she's too scripted

233
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
and poisoned has too much support then

234
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,839
the same people turn to myself and say

235
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,360
she doesn't have support she isn't

236
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,279
prepared she has statues that have a bad

237
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,839
accent why does anyone listen to her and

238
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,920
so i mean i think it offers a useful

239
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,920
contrast so that that way when you can

240
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,680
see the same person saying and saying

241
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,000
both of those you know well

242
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
they just want to disagree with them no

243
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,279
matter who what approach they take

244
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,320
um so john and delphine my next question

245
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,120
is for both of you uh what do you think

246
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,640
as people who've been working in the

247
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,240
area for a while

248
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,440
should be done uh for the protection of

249
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,680
whistleblower even for you know sort of

250
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,959
amplifying their voice uh

251
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,200
maybe each of you could highlight two or

252
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
three points that you feel things that

253
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
are not being done so far and maybe also

254
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,680
share things that have changed recently

255
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,959
which you think is a positive

256
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,440
development that more countries and more

257
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,240
lawmakers must make make note uh let's

258
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,200
begin with john maybe

259
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,600
i think um that

260
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,040
the more that can be done just to

261
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,200
de-stigmatize whistleploy

262
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,000
it's uh it's it's easier said than done

263
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,279
um

264
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,920
and uh as sophie said it's it's a

265
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,800
process that you know that that you work

266
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,959
out within yourself when you've seen

267
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,279
some some malfeasance taking place and

268
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,079
it and then eventually you can't cope

269
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,920
with it but society still has a

270
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,480
particular reaction to whistleblowers

271
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,040
even while praising the

272
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,440
uh the information that has now come to

273
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,480
light

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,680
and so

275
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
not too for what i always

276
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,160
argue is don't forget the whistleblower

277
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,200
uh the information is you know is is uh

278
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,880
is captivating and all that but don't

279
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,160
forget the whistleblowers uh secondly

280
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
i think a positive development uh it's

281
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,959
still nascent around the world uh but

282
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,160
we've seen it

283
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,320
across africa especially common law

284
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,560
africa where we now have legislation

285
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,360
that protects researchers we have uh

286
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,680
institutions that are actually created

287
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,160
to help whistleblowers they're still you

288
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,320
know i would say very formative stages

289
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,880
they haven't done very much but at least

290
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,680
one uh appreciates that there isn't this

291
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,839
sensitivity that this is an important

292
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,279
issue

293
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,720
and that

294
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,079
our democracy

295
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,720
cannot function unless

296
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,440
we have specific mechanisms for

297
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,079
protecting this uh unique class of

298
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:56,079
people who

299
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:57,200
who

300
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,040
who blow the whistle

301
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,200
when when others are perhaps more

302
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,560
cautious or simply not able

303
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,200
yet totally i definitely agree with john

304
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:11,200
that we are seeing a slow improvement in

305
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,440
worldwide of how we survivors are

306
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,959
perceived how legislation are improving

307
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,680
slowly to better protect resabler

308
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,360
especially

309
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,240
you right now all the eu members are

310
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,639
adopting better laws to better protect

311
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,279
whistleblowers we see interest in the us

312
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,880
congress we see so we we see it slowly

313
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,959
but it is slow and it is

314
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,240
so much needed because as sophie know it

315
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,200
it is such a hard journey how each we

316
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,760
serve lord journey is unique there's no

317
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,079
one recipe to make it

318
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,720
happen safely and with the biggest

319
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:54,320
impact there's no one journey and also

320
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
it's each individual has to decide on

321
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,519
its own if it's the journey for them i

322
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,680
would never encourage someone to do it i

323
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,720
would do everything we can to provide to

324
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,040
take workers all the information they

325
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
need to know what it does look like what

326
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,680
they should be aware of

327
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
they should hear from many uh tech

328
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,440
researchers who have been through that

329
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,360
journey what it looks like what they

330
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,279
wish they would have known

331
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,360
to know how to talk to a lawyer to know

332
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,320
how to sometimes negotiate with a lawyer

333
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,560
to know how to talk to a journalist to

334
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,560
know what's the relationship with a

335
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,680
journalist a journalist not a friend

336
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
and you need to understand how the

337
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,839
journalists think so that's what we are

338
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,680
doing in really the first part of our

339
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,320
work that we call the empower so we put

340
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,160
together for example the tech worker

341
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,079
handbook that i really encourage

342
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,680
everybody to look at

343
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,839
it goes from what are the personal

344
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,760
questions you should ask yourself if

345
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,440
you're seeing something wrong at your

346
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:52,880
company and

347
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,160
are thinking of what you can do it and

348
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,880
it goes also into the legal question

349
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,959
what i should know about my nda to which

350
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
lawyer i should talk to

351
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,800
and so on and also we are we provide

352
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,120
legal support we can connect

353
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,240
uh

354
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,600
workers with expert lawyers if they're

355
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,760
considering speaking out if they are

356
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,600
considering their options

357
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,279
but most of the whistleblowers we

358
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,279
support are basically sent to us by a

359
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:25,839
journalist so to give you an example for

360
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,120
example um recently one of the

361
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,800
current public

362
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,480
case i can talk about

363
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
uh a few months ago uh time reporter

364
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,320
billy perrigo came to us telling us that

365
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,120
he was working on a facebook story in

366
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,040
africa but that

367
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,399
the sources he was talking to really

368
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,560
needed some legal support and

369
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,560
psychological support because they were

370
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
really

371
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,079
experiencing severe ptsd and so we

372
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,560
provided this legal support

373
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,880
and are still providing it as well as

374
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,519
expert psychological support to treat

375
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,000
this uh severe ptsd

376
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
and when the story was ready to come out

377
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,720
it was a cover story of time in february

378
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
it was called um

379
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:14,240
inside facebook african sweatshop

380
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,120
and

381
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,399
we continue to provide this support to

382
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,519
um the main sources but we also

383
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,440
connected

384
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,680
the whistleblower and the journalists

385
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,120
with the right

386
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,120
people who would then turn the

387
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,759
revelation into real change what does it

388
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,440
mean it means that we organize calls

389
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
with u.s congress staff uk

390
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,800
mps also providing platforms unlike

391
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,440
op-eds real facebook oversight board

392
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,480
events

393
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,639
uh and we connected with foxglove

394
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,560
lawyers for example to really turn the

395
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,399
revelation into

396
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,079
a powerful legal

397
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:57,199
consequences and so as first as example

398
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,519
of the first change we observed is for

399
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,040
example the

400
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:03,519
facebook content moderators in kenya a

401
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,600
few weeks after the articles came out

402
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,639
obtained a raise so it's a symbol it's a

403
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,839
first step

404
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,560
but i think it's i use this example to

405
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
show that

406
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,519
we saw blowing journey should not be an

407
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:18,160
individual journey it should be a team

408
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
journey

409
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,320
to be really it's so hard and so being

410
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,279
alone for that journey is is

411
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,600
superhero work and most of us are just

412
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,399
human beings uh but connecting with the

413
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
right human beings the right journalists

414
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,759
the right lawyers the right activists

415
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,519
who will then

416
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,800
turn

417
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:39,279
the revelation into real change it's a

418
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:40,240
team

419
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,959
effort and we really believe that the we

420
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,160
sablers needs to to stay the priority we

421
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,639
will always put the wish of the

422
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,480
whistleblower at the center

423
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,720
but we can try to connect them with the

424
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,160
right uh global community

425
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
um devin you really

426
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,920
you know you mentioned something that i

427
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,320
was also very curious to ask sophie and

428
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,640
both of you john and delphine uh you

429
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,480
know given the amount of risk that

430
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
people like you take sophie

431
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:13,039
what is your sort of you know um

432
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,679
view on how this information that you

433
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,559
have on earth should be used for like

434
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,880
you know deeper action or

435
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,359
uh how those insights are taken what

436
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,439
kind of impact do you wish that

437
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,520
information to have and i'm going to

438
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,200
take that same question to john after

439
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,120
you about you know what kind of impact

440
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,080
he has seen whistleblowers information

441
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:36,480
make to the world and how it can be used

442
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,559
better

443
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,919
yes and

444
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:42,240
like for me for me philosophical when

445
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,799
the topically i think it kind of changes

446
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:46,400
up to the people to decide

447
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,559
not for not like for myself when i keep

448
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,280
an open mind because fundamentally you

449
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,799
can't solve a problem unless you

450
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,200
understand it and that's really what's

451
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
going on that's the problems that i

452
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,480
personally encountered and and and those

453
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,720
that many other reservoirs have that

454
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,160
there's a problem

455
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,080
that only those within the company are

456
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,320
aware of and the broader road is not

457
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,559
aware about and you cannot solve a

458
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,799
problem and as you know it exists and

459
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:15,760
for me personally the role is just

460
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,840
providing that information so that

461
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
others whether it is lawmakers civil

462
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,880
society members of the public et cetera

463
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,200
can make an educated decision if

464
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,240
lawmakers wish to act the more power to

465
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:32,720
them if their society wants to respond

466
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,400
the same

467
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,200
but i mean i'm just one person and

468
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,679
i'm certainly not a legislator or policy

469
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:40,840
maker

470
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,600
or someone else with that level of

471
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,120
expertise

472
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:45,919
and

473
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,880
i entered and i don't think it would be

474
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
fair for me to presume to speak on

475
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,880
behalf of a country especially when i've

476
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,160
never set foot in and so i and so i see

477
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,200
my

478
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,280
personally i see my role as simply

479
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,960
providing the information and letting

480
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,480
others judge for themselves and make the

481
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,039
decisions but everyone is different a

482
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,400
voiceover who has policy expertise

483
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,320
might be involved in writing legislation

484
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,240
for instance that's not myself

485
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,400
john the same question for you

486
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,720
what do you think that the world can

487
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,160
learn from

488
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,240
the revelations of whistleblowers what

489
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,480
do you think how the impact should be

490
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,240
driven by these by this information that

491
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,600
is announced at great risk too

492
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,200
i think the first the first impact

493
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,320
whenever a whistleblower

494
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,080
puts the information in the public

495
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:41,039
domain especially about uh entities that

496
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,880
have been fairly secretive that we all

497
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
use they say in in the tech industry is

498
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,240
is a mixture of of anger but also

499
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,360
cynicism um you know where people say

500
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,799
well you know we actually we've always

501
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,960
done we have you know we don't trust

502
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,480
these particular groups and they simply

503
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
confirm that but it's it's it's really

504
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:03,280
about how one uses uh the young the

505
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,880
anger uh

506
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,400
to be able to organize

507
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,440
um whether you're organizing

508
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:12,640
legally to take action uh whether you

509
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:16,240
can organizing just for for advocacy uh

510
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,559
to promote uh

511
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,120
greater engagement uh uh around the

512
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,000
issue um and and also education and i

513
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,080
think that uh you know organizations

514
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,520
that are involved in in the in the

515
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,559
content that that whistleblowers

516
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:33,840
produce

517
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
have a variety of ways of engaging

518
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
in it

519
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,960
to create a more trustful society

520
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,520
because one of the big blows

521
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,760
that

522
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,679
is is taken

523
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:51,039
by institutions by organizations by

524
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,640
companies by by individuals

525
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,400
when when the truth comes out from

526
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,280
whistleblowers is trust

527
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,520
it's one of the most fundamental things

528
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,440
for us to be able to function properly

529
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:06,559
as a society is uh it's minimum form of

530
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,120
trust and we increasingly engage with

531
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,240
each other using um you know we're

532
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,400
talking on zoom right now and all the

533
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,360
different uh technology that um that we

534
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
use to interact with one another and

535
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,799
when trusting that is uh is is demeaned

536
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,360
then that you know provides an important

537
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,840
opportunity for organizations to engage

538
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,120
whether it's in asset whether it's

539
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,520
advocacy or legally i know the kenyan

540
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,550
case um

541
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:34,080
[Music]

542
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,320
caused quite a bit of excitement um here

543
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,640
but then seemed to uh

544
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,200
to peter off and it always works like

545
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,880
that uh

546
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,799
you know when you blow the whistle and

547
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:47,840
one can

548
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,720
can feel quite low about it that uh it

549
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,880
it always causes a big splash which

550
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
peters out because another you know

551
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,760
russia invades ukraine you know and and

552
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,960
um but it's to keep uh the fire burning

553
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,200
and keep pushing because these issues uh

554
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
are important to the way we interact in

555
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,360
society and fundamental society and

556
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,159
fundamental trust uh in society the way

557
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,400
we interact with each other

558
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,400
i see delphine nodding

559
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,840
if you have anything to add on this

560
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
please go ahead no i it's a very

561
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
important point that john uh raised uh

562
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,000
of the in the difficulty and the

563
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,720
importance to keep the fire burning

564
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,039
because already to succeed to make a

565
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,840
media splash requires a lot of work a

566
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,480
lot of coordination that's really the

567
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,679
the secret

568
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:36,480
to

569
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:39,440
real impact is to keep the fire burning

570
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,919
a long time so the the revelation don't

571
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:45,120
disappear in the new cycle and so for

572
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,600
that um i found so far many uh kind of

573
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,159
ways to make it happen so first i will

574
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:55,520
always try to encourage that media who

575
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
received

576
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,000
important information from a

577
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,919
whistleblower share them work

578
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:03,679
collaboratively with other media in from

579
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,520
other countries will reach a different

580
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,640
audience

581
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,360
because that's a way to keep the fire

582
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,280
burning at different spots at the same

583
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:14,400
time and so for example two weeks ago i

584
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,960
coordinated 13 media who had early

585
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:19,360
access to human rights watch

586
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,840
technical evidence on

587
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:24,000
education technology that were

588
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:27,520
recommended by 49 countries during the

589
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,000
pandemic and how this education

590
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,000
technology were actually tracking data

591
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,360
of children

592
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,840
and allegedly violating children's

593
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,080
rights and i'm so happy that we were

594
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,039
able to work with brazilian indonesian

595
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,080
australian korean japanese media as well

596
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,480
as the washington post and

597
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,559
and that's in a sense when these

598
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,960
revelations were made by all the media

599
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,279
that definitely got the attention of the

600
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,440
companies much more than when human

601
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
rights watch initially reach out to the

602
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,760
companies and i'm very proud that all

603
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:02,159
these data will be made public

604
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,799
in the later this month for all

605
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:06,480
academics across the world all

606
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,799
journalists across the world to be able

607
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,919
to continue this fire on their own

608
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:14,880
looking at the evidence and making sure

609
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,799
that the companies change their behavior

610
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:20,320
that the government add up the right um

611
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,039
alert and protocols to make sure that

612
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,159
children who do have uh schools at home

613
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,000
because of the pandemic are are kept

614
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,640
safe so yeah it requires each time a

615
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,799
different strategy but keeping the fire

616
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,840
burning

617
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,919
everywhere to make sure things happen is

618
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,080
a one very important key so thank you

619
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,520
john for highlighting this

620
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,000
before i go to my next question i just

621
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
like to remind all the participants the

622
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,000
audience here uh we have last five

623
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,760
minutes so if you have any questions

624
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,039
please

625
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,720
send them to us and we'll try to take

626
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,440
them

627
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,000
uh sophie delphine spoke about you know

628
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,880
keeping the fire burning now for you

629
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,760
uh

630
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:01,600
the battle is far from over we were just

631
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,279
discussing before we started the panel

632
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:04,960
that you came out with some revelations

633
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,760
about

634
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:08,159
india earlier today you haven't slept in

635
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,159
many many hours i believe

636
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,720
uh could you talk to us about it

637
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,200
you have

638
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,679
could you talk to us about uh

639
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:18,880
uh

640
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,799
i mean i uh the fact that you know you

641
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,880
are you have information about india and

642
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,640
you're not getting a chance to speak

643
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,159
could you tell us all what's happened

644
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,400
what uh and what you're feeling right

645
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,840
now

646
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,159
absolutely so just for context for

647
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:33,200
everyone

648
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
at the end the indian part of the indian

649
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,480
parliament

650
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,720
looks upon one of the committees voted

651
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
unanimously to hear my time to to invite

652
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,960
me to testify but six months ago which

653
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,360
which was quite an achievement because i

654
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:49,200
mean this required people from both

655
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
major parties to vote in

656
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,600
mostly for me and things are very

657
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,240
acrimonious divided in india on partisan

658
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,960
levels now especially since

659
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
members of both major parties were

660
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:03,039
implicated in my documents and so that

661
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:05,279
is a credit to india's government

662
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,600
unfortunately that request needed to be

663
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:10,559
approved by the speaker of the indian

664
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,840
doksupah

665
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,080
who is required to respond but not does

666
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
not have a deadline on responding and so

667
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:17,919
in

668
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,840
any ways in short i seem to have been

669
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,600
responsible for the invention of a

670
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,960
pocket veto by that indian speaker who

671
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,520
has chosen to refuse responding for the

672
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,520
past six months

673
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,200
and so

674
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,200
and and so and so

675
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
it would i believe that the indian

676
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:36,720
government should have first right of

677
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,679
refusal on this information but because

678
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:42,159
but beca but because

679
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,080
because the speaker was single-handedly

680
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,480
blocking it without accountability

681
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,559
acknowledgement or even an explanation

682
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,960
of any sort i chose to provide the same

683
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,400
documentation i offered to the

684
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039

685
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:56,880
people we are the we are dozens of

686
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,840
indian news now authors and so they've

687
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,159
began publishing oh

688
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,039
it's

689
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,880
over the last

690
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,200
16 hours or so

691
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,760
when publication the buyer has published

692
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
my documentation in their entirety

693
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,240
and i

694
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,039
and and so and so as a result i've come

695
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,640
forward with regarding a number of

696
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,960
details that i had previously have for

697
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,720
the indian government such as the

698
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,799
identities upon indian politicians

699
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:27,520
involved in this activity and the fact

700
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:30,000
and the fact that i that my documents

701
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,159
directly contradict shift not sucrose

702
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:34,880
testimony reported testimony to the to

703
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,720
the indian parliament which would be

704
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,000
potentially a crime

705
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,720
um sophie given these experiences

706
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,320
including this recent one in india one

707
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,279
in india

708
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,120
is there something that you would want

709
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,080
to convey to people who might be wanting

710
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,919
to take the course that you do

711
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,399
to become whistleblowers and we have

712
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,640
last two minutes so so if you could just

713
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,399
keep your answer brief and then we'll

714
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,600
take the same to john and to delphine as

715
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,679
in if there is someone right now who

716
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,399
wants to take this courageous step

717
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,000
what is what are the first few things

718
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,559
they should do sophie beginning with you

719
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:13,279
it's a deeply personal step i i never

720
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,360
advise people to do it i simply offer

721
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,760
advice and doesn't make the decision no

722
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,679
one is obligated to torch their career

723
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
and life for an idea i've written an op

724
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,919
ad on the guardian about advice for

725
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,000
whistleblowers i encourage everyone to

726
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,559
read it and to reach out to myself

727
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,240
if they have any if they are considering

728
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,200
taking this step thank you

729
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,039
john

730
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,320
well i think uh i would you know i think

731
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,159
sophie has really given the

732
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,640
best advice i think it's

733
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,600
it's very important to um to have a very

734
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:48,720
clear idea of your support team uh

735
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
whether it's it's your family your

736
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,880
friends that must be very clear because

737
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,200
it is going to be a tumultuous

738
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,360
period just for yourself as a

739
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:59,520
whistleblower you need to know who your

740
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,520
friends are who you can go to i think

741
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,480
that's that's very important number two

742
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,159
uh document everything meticulously uh

743
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:09,279
you know

744
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:12,799
there should be no no no gaps

745
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,880
and those will be my two pieces of

746
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,200
advice once a decision has already been

747
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
made and with the advice of of people

748
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,480
that you trust and love

749
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,679
selfie

750
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,399
yeah very good point john and and sophie

751
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,559
uh i would recommend to read the tech

752
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,000
worker handbook

753
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,000
and look especially at the personal

754
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,399
assessment question that i called like

755
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,399
that to really ask yourself the right

756
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,919
question what do i want to achieve

757
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,480
what's my support team things like that

758
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,720
and that helps you make or not a

759
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,919
decision

760
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,440
uh and then

761
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:48,320
uh reach out find the right journalists

762
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:50,480

764
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,120
