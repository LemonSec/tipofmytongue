a thai pro-democracy activist and a

10

leader for the united front of tamasa

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,160
i'll be your facilitator today and my

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,558
name is aymente i'm the features editor

for frontier manpower a news magazine

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,880
focused on current affairs in myanmar

16
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,440
um so uh something that all three of us

17
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,000
have in common uh who are on the

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,239
in this fireside chat today are that we

19
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,000
are all used working from exile from

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,640
where we used to be which were hong kong

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,039
thailand and myanmar respectively

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,039
this is a rising trend among those of us

23
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,760
who are working to keep our societies in

24
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,079
east and southeast asia more free and

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,640
more democratic and not only are we in a

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,719
precarious situation because we cannot

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,640
know if our host governments

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,960
will continue to be able to host us but

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,880
we also have to worry about our friends

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,560
colleagues and families who are left

31
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:13,439
behind in some cases in prison

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
i personally have two family members in

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,439
prison right now a colleague who was

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,439
recently released from prison and my

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
mother is currently wanted and on the

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,040
run back in myanmar

37
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,640
the work we do

38
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,200
generally in danger endangers the

39
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,640
activists and journalists who are

40
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,079
working on this stuff

41
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,920
but to stop the work is also to allow

42
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
that danger to swallow the rest of our

43
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,840
communities unimpeded

44
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,759
so we're here today to discuss digital

45
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,079
authoritarianism which many countries in

46
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:41,680
east and southeast asia are trending

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,159
towards including the increasing of

48
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,479
surveillance the removal of anonymity

49
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
online and the prosecution of online

50
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
speech and behavior

51
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,280
in myanmar where i used to work and sort

52
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,520
of the country i still focus on much of

53
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,680
the internet is now inaccessible without

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
vpn and most of the independent inter

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,840
independent news outlets are outright

56
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,000
banned making much of the journalism

57
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
that is being done technically a crime

58
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,959
as well as the activism and

59
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,879
advocacy for

60
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,360
regime change as well as for

61
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,680
new elections and

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
for democracy to be respected

63
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,040
uh technically also a crime and the

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,360
regime in control of the telecoms

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,319
community

66
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,640
but sorry let me start over and the

67
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,560
military regime in control of the

68
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,319
telecom companies

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,400
is currently used actively using them to

70
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,400
surveil the entire country to find

71
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
dissidents so that they can be

72
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,599
imprisoned which often means that

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,400
they're also being tortured

74
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,800
and to try and stop the resistance

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,640
movement against them

76
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,519
so

77
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,519
for our two speakers today i would like

78
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:51,680
to start off by asking what are some

79
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,400
laws existing or proposed related to

80
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,319
digital authoritarianism that you're

81
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,319
most worried about right now or

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,480
alternatively what do you think is the

83
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,480
biggest challenge moving forward in

84
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,640
regards to these issues in the context

85
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,560
of which you work

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,599
and i think i will ask um

87
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,839
panacea to answer that first

88
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,879
okay uh thank you for the question and i

89
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,040
can

90
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:42,899
[Music]

91
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,120
um

92
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,239
um

93
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:10,029
[Music]

94
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,840
uh

95
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:33,079
[Music]

96
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,200
foreign

97
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,260
[Music]

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,080
foreign

99
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,440
thank you so much um i think that's

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,520
definitely something a trend we see in

101
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,440
myanmar as well where

102
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,639
we don't have a less majesties law but

103
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,800
very common um

104
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,560
legal codes that get used against

105
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,039
activists especially are

106
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,240
sedition as well as incitement

107
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,919
and i think it's really interesting to

108
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:37,520
note how often these sorts of things are

109
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,880
tied to

110
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
allegedly undermining the security of

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,160
the country

112
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
um as opposed to kind of what they're

113
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,080
really about which is

114
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,560
insulting people in power or people in

115
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,800
power feeling like they're insulted

116
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:53,039
um

117
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:55,120
uh can we can i ask you the same

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,400
question

119
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,440
yes of course um in hong kong it's

120
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,680
quite

121
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,840
crazy like in my opinion never expected

122
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,360
to see that kind of thing in hong kong

123
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,880
basically we have

124
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,360
a law called the national security law

125
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,120
in hong kong right now that's being

126
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,960
imposed since 2020 it basically

127
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:17,520
criminalizes all sorts of dissents

128
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
and political activities that are not

129
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,919
like suitable in beijing so it's

130
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:23,039
basically

131
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,680
um if you are a local protesters you're

132
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,880
basically terrorists if you're

133
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,600
encouraging people to go to protest you

134
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,160
fall into the same category and if you

135
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,520
like me are talking to like

136
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,960
international organizations foreign

137
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,319
governments then you're colluding with

138
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:38,400
foreign forces and it also has an

139
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
implication on the online world imagine

140
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,000
you actually don't know where the red

141
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,400
line is when you're using social media

142
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,199
or retweeting something that's related

143
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:49,120
to for example calling for sanctions

144
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,199
against chinese officials online that

145
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:52,720
may be counted as like infringing

146
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,199
national security law at the same time

147
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,960
this law actually provides the

148
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,960
government with immense power and they

149
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,560
can use this power against online

150
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,800
service providers platforms and internet

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
service providers for example they can

152
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,919
request websites being removed from the

153
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,560
internet in hong kong and a few websites

154
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,880
like ngos in the uk called hong kong

155
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,560
watch is being removed from the hong

156
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,440
kong internet by like a dns tampering so

157
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,680
if you don't have a vpn in hong kong you

158
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,120
basically have no access to those

159
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,720
information

160
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,800
and internet service providers are

161
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,759
obliged to carry out this decision or

162
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,639
else they risk criminal liability

163
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,639
and also they risk if they're not

164
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,639
complying they're going to be there like

165
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,479
servers or whatever they use to host the

166
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:37,919
contents will be removed by the

167
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,199
government so that they can do it

168
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,120
themselves so it basically puts

169
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
everybody in a very difficult situation

170
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,440
as ordinary users you start to second

171
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,360
guess whether or not something is okay

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,599
to be said and as service providers you

173
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,560
kind of face you either cease operating

174
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,039
in hong kong or you comply with national

175
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,440
security law which goes against the

176
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,120
value like for example freedom speech

177
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,879
freedom of expression that they that

178
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,800
they want to uphold so everybody is

179
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,080
being put in this very difficult

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,120
situation and another thing is um we we

181
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,000
have something like a sedition law too

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,160
like as thailand and myanmar does and

183
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
the scope we see the application of that

184
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,800
scope it's widening from criticizing the

185
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,879
government which is clearly in their

186
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,160
eyes addition

187
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,919
to commenting on government's public

188
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:24,080
policy people have been arrested

189
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,240
for commenting covet policies online

190
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,919
saying that we're not going to use the

191
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:29,599
corona app because it has security

192
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,320
concerns to say of privacy concerns

193
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,760
they they get arrested and they get

194
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,519
charged with addition like

195
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,958
there are a lot of like these kind of

196
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,719
different cases that are ongoing so we

197
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,719
kind of see more and more laws being

198
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,039
used and it's not only like this very

199
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
obviously politically driven laws there

200
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,040
like for example the government's

201
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,880
proposing copyright amendment in hong

202
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,800
kong again which actually hinder free

203
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
speech online because they don't provide

204
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,120
enough exemption for many common

205
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,279
expression when it comes to politics

206
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,200
like memes derivative works user

207
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,360
generated content they don't cover them

208
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
well enough so that you're kind of like

209
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:04,880
oh i'm not sure if it's going to be a

210
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,640
corporate invention so maybe i should

211
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,360
stop doing it and all of these laws all

212
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,279
serves a common purpose which is using

213
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,240
fear

214
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,040
to kind of lure you into self-censorship

215
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:17,200
because the risk of speaking up is too

216
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,279
high and most people will have that

217
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,000
mindset of better be safe than sorry so

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
to kind of like create a chilling like

219
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,320
it actually creates a chilling effect in

220
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,160
the society and people stop speaking

221
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,040
about different things

222
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,040
yeah thank you for sharing that um

223
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,519
i think the self-censorship angle is

224
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,920
something that's quite important um

225
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:41,360
because it's not just as you were saying

226
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,680
the legal repression right it's creating

227
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,680
a situation in which the people

228
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,600
essentially internalize

229
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,880
uh these repressive government's logics

230
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,360
about what is and is an acceptable uh

231
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,279
political speech or just any speech at

232
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,080
all

233
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,399
um so that brings me to my next question

234
00:09:58,399 --> 00:09:59,680
actually

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,320
which is related to self-censorship um

236
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
especially because of the kind of

237
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,839
harassment that people tend to face both

238
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:09,680
legal as well as social i think we've

239
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,760
all seen kind of these armies of bots

240
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
and trolls online that will go after

241
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
activists and dissidents and journalists

242
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,600
do you ever find yourself self-censoring

243
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
and trying to mitigate harm

244
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
whether that is in terms of the exact

245
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,120
wording you might use whether or not you

246
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
talk about a specific topic at all or

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,480
like in terms of your timing um how how

248
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
are you kind of navigating the situation

249
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,920
um and uh let's start with you

250
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
okay i i think i i

251
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
i'm muted myself yes um i'd say i do

252
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
practice self-censorship like i'm

253
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,240
currently living abroad in exile in

254
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,440
germany

255
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,760
uh and i do engage in self-censorship

256
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,079
still like there are things i know i

257
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,200
shouldn't talk about because it will put

258
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,200
colleagues and friends that are still in

259
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,519
hong kong in danger like i will not

260
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,800
disclose

261
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,600
any details of them even unless they

262
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
give me like explicit content like you

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,440
can talk about it to international media

264
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,480
and so on

265
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,040
and when i was back in hong kong i do

266
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,959
observe that my i am practicing

267
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,480
self-censorship in real life and in

268
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,880
online spaces because at the time i was

269
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,800
helping a candidate in hong kong to run

270
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,320
her election

271
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,200
and we would sit down and said okay this

272
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,040
wording on the pamphlet might be

273
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,120
problematic in terms of the national

274
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,440
security law is there something we can

275
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,200
change how do we change it how do we

276
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,839
circumvent the red line and that is

277
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
basically complete the complete opposite

278
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,440
of what i just talked about which is we

279
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,959
shouldn't engage in self-censorship

280
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,760
because it's how everybody stops talking

281
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,200
about certain things because fear is

282
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,279
contagious in that case

283
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:54,160
um and i think right now i still do too

284
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,800
i know that there are certain things

285
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
um that

286
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,600
should not be said or else i'll as i

287
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,920
said i'll drive people into trouble and

288
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,360
at the same time i know there are

289
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,560
certain

290
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,079
ideas that we're not supposed to discuss

291
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,200
like for example any uh any discussion

292
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,839
whether or not i support it or not about

293
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
separatism on in the international world

294
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,360
like if uighurs or tibetans should have

295
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,360
a say or should have self-determination

296
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,240
should hon congress have

297
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,079
self-determination these things we kind

298
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,279
of refrain from talking about it

299
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,240
publicly online as well but it's not

300
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,360
related to only to china oppression but

301
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,680
it's also related to how

302
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,079
you want to be perceived in in terms of

303
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,680
the international movement in general

304
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,959
because a lot of politicians and

305
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:39,920
governments

306
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,839
are very afraid of talking like touching

307
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,440
on these topics because of beijing

308
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,760
reaction and so we kind of have to

309
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,760
navigate all of those norms and all

310
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
those settings at the same time so we do

311
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,360
engage a lot in self-censorship being

312
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,639
inside or outside of hong kong

313
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:59,760
that sounds extremely familiar um but

314
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
can i get uh

315
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,720
to

316
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,360
add your perspective on that

317
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,800
i i think three of us have familiar

318
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,760
experience of that uh

319
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,760
in thailand we

320
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,279
our uh thailand activities is

321
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:20,800
we we try to push our bar to of the

322
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
freedom of speech in thailand because

323
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,920
one of the demands of our protest is

324
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,800
about reforming the monarchy which is

325
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:31,839
the

326
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,240
very risky risky uh thing to to do in in

327
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,240
thailand maybe you can get killed or

328
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,199
something

329
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,600
but you don't know so

330
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,399
when we try to push that we we try so

331
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,639
hard and actually a success for for like

332
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,680
the cultural movement but

333
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,480
after that after we

334
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,880
get the uh

335
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,440
put to jail uh or

336
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:03,279
arrested by the police and server time

337
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:03,810
then we

338
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:05,279
[Music]

339
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,720
later later that we try to self-center

340
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,639
centers again

341
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:13,199
we try to like

342
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,320
don't

343
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,440
don't talk about about the the thing

344
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,800
like too straight

345
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,240
like we we have to like use uh the

346
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,680
symbol or use the meme or the

347
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,120
uh sarcastic thing to to say about that

348
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,160
instead to go go straight and say it

349
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,360
because like we don't

350
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,320
we think we think that we don't want

351
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
any of us to go to put to jail

352
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
again because it

353
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,519
yeah you know it's waste of time in the

354
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,839
jail and you can do anything for the

355
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,920
movement and

356
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,600
also

357
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,399
the relationship with the family

358
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,480
is very important

359
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,120
for me like i am

360
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,639
i was

361
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,760
put to jail like three times in the past

362
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,880
two years and it

363
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,360
it become like

364
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
a very big problem

365
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,320
in our family because

366
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,240
like the young kid

367
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,320
like the youngest daughter is going to

368
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,120
jail and what what the others do

369
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,800
for her and

370
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,880
for right now

371
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,720
i think everyone in in my family is

372
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,639
uh overly stressed

373
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,680
and depressed but we yeah we try we try

374
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,399
to get back together and recovering

375
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,240
everyone but also

376
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,880
this is this is like

377
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,040
it's obvious that

378
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,079
the

379
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,000
government and

380
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,600
who who have

381
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,680
poor that have the power like the king

382
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,040
of the thailand try to do with that

383
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,160
they try to like don't you if you don't

384
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,959
say anything i don't i don't

385
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:02,000
do anything to you but if you say so

386
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,720
i will put you to jail or do anything

387
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,480
worse

388
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,759
and it's just like that today today now

389
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,959
okay we have we have a

390
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,240
more

391
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,759
uh like a high higher bar of freedom of

392
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:20,320
speech in thailand but

393
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
and we have uh some people who still

394
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,120
maintaining that by but

395
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,480
now the

396
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,639
older activists

397
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,440
that

398
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,040
fight by before have to buy

399
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,279
the low lower

400
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,040
lower our bar to keep keep like

401
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,920
keep ourselves

402
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,120
outside not in a zoo

403
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,800
yeah um that actually brings me to my

404
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,360
next question uh which is a little bit

405
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
about how

406
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,160
do you navigate um the work that you do

407
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,560
especially when you know it can endanger

408
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,359
not just yourself uh but your family and

409
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,199
your the people you associate with as

410
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,079
well

411
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,079
um i'm in a

412
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,919
supposed you call it lucky position in

413
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,679
that my family members who are currently

414
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:17,760
um either imprisoned or on the run from

415
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,839
the regime um it's through their own

416
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,400
activism so it wasn't because i was out

417
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,400
there being very rebellious

418
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,839
um

419
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:28,720
but uh you know it the rest of my family

420
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,880
didn't necessarily sign up for this and

421
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,720
i'm sure your families different family

422
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
members have different um

423
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,799
understandings about what you do and how

424
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,480
they feel about it so i was wondering if

425
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
you could talk a bit about that as well

426
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,240
um and can we start with you paneer saku

427
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,400
so yeah sorry for instagram it's okay

428
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,559
okay

429
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,720
uh this time i would i would say inside

430
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,000
so sorry uh

431
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,280
human

432
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,960
foreign

433
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,480
um

434
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
right um

435
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,520
what about you chongcheng do you want to

436
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,320
add anything to that

437
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,440
i i'd say it's quite tricky for me

438
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,159
personally too uh like i still have

439
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,240
friends and loved ones who are inside of

440
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,520
hong kong

441
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,919
and the way to protect them is basically

442
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,720
not tell them anything because it's the

443
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,240
easiest way

444
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,559
to help them circumvent the risk like if

445
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:21,919
they get asked do you know what

446
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,520
chongqing hong is up to they can

447
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,360
honestly say i really don't know and

448
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,120
then they don't have to pretend

449
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,640
that they don't know

450
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:29,520
um

451
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,000
but it's really really sad to know that

452
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,360
the things that you do actually put

453
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,400
people at risk in my case like media has

454
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,159
done interviews with me after i've been

455
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,600
like quite active in terms of

456
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,679
international advocacy

457
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
and it became

458
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,080
proven core that they're committing

459
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:48,080
sedition and those people actually know

460
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,159
in real life and we're friends or some

461
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
colleagues sharing the work that i do in

462
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,919
there like again on call documents

463
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,919
saying that this is the proof of

464
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,280
violating the national security law and

465
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,120
even though you reasonably know it's not

466
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,000
your fault it's actually not you it's

467
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,400
the oppressor's fault but you still kind

468
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
of struggle with the fact that you seem

469
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,240
to be putting other people at risk

470
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,480
and it's a very difficult difficult

471
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,080
topic to talk to people as well because

472
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,280
you know your friends are going to be

473
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
like don't be silly it's not your fault

474
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,520
but you kind of struggle with the guilt

475
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,440
on a daily basis whenever you heard

476
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,320
about

477
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,400
these things and

478
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,039
i i genuinely don't have a solution or

479
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,880
navigate like how do i navigate with

480
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
these things i'm just like okay i'm

481
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,720
gonna live with it and see what i can do

482
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,320
in the future but at

483
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,919
this moment i'm still kind of struggling

484
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,360
with all of the

485
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,000
impacts that my work has in other on

486
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,559
other people

487
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:45,440
yeah i mean it's definitely quite

488
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:48,720
difficult um and i think especially when

489
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,000
we are all

490
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,760
we all have to essentially

491
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,159
upend our lives and and move to other

492
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:56,880
places it can be especially isolating

493
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,919
um

494
00:21:57,919 --> 00:21:59,200
to know that

495
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,080
uh not only can are we in completely new

496
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,520
spaces

497
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,559
we

498
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,720
can't very we can't talk about some of

499
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,919
the things we're doing with the people

500
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
closest to us

501
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:12,400
um i wanted to pivot just a little bit

502
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,520
um

503
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,840
and maybe bring a little bit of optimism

504
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,720
back into the discussion uh but you know

505
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
i think something that i think about a

506
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:24,240
lot is the fact that a lot of these

507
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
regimes we sort of want to be dictators

508
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,480
are

509
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,600
even if they're not directly

510
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
communicating with each other they're

511
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,240
definitely watching each other and

512
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
learning from each other in terms of how

513
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
they can impress the the countries that

514
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
they have control over

515
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,520
so i was wondering if um

516
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:44,080
from your perspective what are some

517
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,280
things that

518
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,320
the

519
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:48,080
um kind of

520
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,240
the movements

521
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,400
between our countries of our countries

522
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,799
are doing well uh and whether or not

523
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,559
whether you think we are learning from

524
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:59,039
each other as well and what advice you

525
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,760
would give for other countries um for

526
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:04,880
activists uh and others in countries who

527
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,640
look at a situation in hong kong or

528
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,200
myanmar thailand um then they can take

529
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,200
away and to make sure that their

530
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,480
countries don't follow down this path

531
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,200
um do you want to start junction

532
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,400
yeah of course um my right advice it

533
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
feels quite patronizing to say advice in

534
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
a way i have no position to advise you

535
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,280
because we're all in very different

536
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,840
situations uh but my

537
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,240
like really heartfelt things that came

538
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,000
on a few levels the first level is

539
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,640
personal level as an activist as a human

540
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,720
right defenders as a participant of any

541
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,159
kind of social movement you really

542
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,919
really have to take care of yourself

543
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:42,400
physically and mentally that's your

544
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,640
your body and your mental health is your

545
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,200
assets to actually do things so you

546
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
really have to take a break and avoid

547
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,679
burnout in all situations you have to

548
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,080
make yourself a priority in some cases i

549
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,000
know it's very difficult like everyone

550
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,760
struggles with it every activist i know

551
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,000
struggle with it all from all walks of

552
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,320
different activism and at the same time

553
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,120
i think um we always have to

554
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,679
uh on on an organization level we always

555
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,039
have to stay in touch with other

556
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:10,480
movements and other things because more

557
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,240
than often we have common grounds we're

558
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
all fighting for to be honest the same

559
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,000
thing which is for a better world that

560
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,760
we can all live in together happily and

561
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,760
have like great lives and so on and

562
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,279
there are always lessons to learn from

563
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,120
i'm not saying we're directly comparable

564
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,440
but looking at what happened in hong

565
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,960
kong and thailand there are so many

566
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,799
parallels that we are learning from each

567
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,480
other and trying to develop

568
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,480
things and strategies that actually

569
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,159
are developed by one another and then we

570
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,919
kind of evolved together and i think

571
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:37,520
this kind of support and this kind of

572
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,840
organizational cooperation is like very

573
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
important and finally i think we should

574
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:43,279
all learn to

575
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:45,600
um to push our governments to do better

576
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,520
for one another it's not just hong kong

577
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,080
or it's not just thailand or myanmar

578
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,400
because the oppressors they all have

579
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,200
like common interests and so do we as

580
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,039
activists so there is always ways that

581
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,200
we can work together to fight for policy

582
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,600
changes for different kind of like

583
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,720
like for example in the vengeance

584
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,880
sanctions regime we all benefit from it

585
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,799
because thailand our presence deserves

586
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,480
to be sanctioned myanmar presses deserve

587
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,799
to be sanctions and china is too and so

588
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:12,480
we can all work together on these levels

589
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,320
so that we can facilitate like better

590
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,200
changes in the world

591
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,720
yeah i mean i think something that was

592
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,960
quite inspiring uh this last couple

593
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,279
years has been the expansion of the

594
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,000
milty alliance especially um i think

595
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
every time you know people add like a

596
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,720
new cup of milk tea it's really exciting

597
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
to see i mean it's really tragic because

598
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,960
obviously it speaks to

599
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,760
how common uh these repressions are but

600
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,039
i think it's also great to see that

601
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,240
people are starting to understand that

602
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,679
you know all of our struggles are

603
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:47,520
interconnected and that we have more

604
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,720
comment that we have uh differences

605
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:51,919
um

606
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:52,799
yeah

607
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,600
do you want to add anything to that

608
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:59,440
yeah i i think it's like oh you said uh

609
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,039
even we didn't

610
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:05,279
uh contact that much but

611
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:07,760
also we follow the movement in other

612
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,799
countries from like time to time and or

613
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:11,919
something to

614
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,360
into our own

615
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,600
like

616
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,480
hong kong hong kong demonstration like

617
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:21,520
leaderless and they will stretch more

618
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,440
fresh mapping using communication

619
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,480
technology

620
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,720
and we are we adopt that to

621
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,600
to do in thailand too and also in

622
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,720
myanmar

623
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,600
like how to protect self

624
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,279
with uh

625
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,760
with the thing that you can find

626
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,880
in your

627
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:39,840
in your

628
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
like your area

629
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,799
is i think this is amazing and yeah we

630
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:47,520
we also about that to do in the

631
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,320
uh

632
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:51,279
in in thailand demonstration too

633
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,559
and i don't know what what i should say

634
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,400
more because like you also said but

635
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,679
i

636
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:02,159
i actually i want to know like

637
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,840
uh

638
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,960
i want to learn like how how the

639
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,520
activities in different countries like

640
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,720
extremists and run their own

641
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,480
organization

642
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,000
like how to make it very strong and

643
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,399
can put the people together

644
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,440
like i i think in china we have we like

645
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,640
struggle with

646
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,760
this thing

647
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,200
right now and

648
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,159
yeah we want to

649
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,640
i think that's a really good question

650
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,000
it's

651
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,880
i think often times even when

652
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,159
people are fighting this great injustice

653
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,559
that people's personal egos can come and

654
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:51,760
stand in the way uh there's trust issues

655
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,720
uh i think in part facilitated by these

656
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,679
regimes right who try to undermine

657
00:27:57,679 --> 00:27:59,760
uh collaboration between groups because

658
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,039
they understand how powerful that is um

659
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,440
and then there's also just

660
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:08,399
the stress and

661
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,720
that can kind of make anyone make

662
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:13,520
four choices

663
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,600
so i think we have just a minute left

664
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,760
before we open it up to audience

665
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,360
questions um

666
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,039
i think because we have such short

667
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,679
amount of time uh just in like a couple

668
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:29,520
words or just a sentence can you uh tell

669
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,480
us why

670
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
why do you keep fighting despite

671
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:33,760
everything

672
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,720
um whoever wants to come first uh maybe

673
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,440
panacea

674
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,200
oh okay i think i think it's simple

675
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,520
like we don't finish our job yet

676
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,320
that's why we will keep going on till we

677
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:53,039
reach our goal that's it i i just want

678
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,440
to see democracy in thailand i just want

679
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:56,720
to say that

680
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,480
like we have a freedom

681
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,880
like really literally freedom like

682
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,640
freedom of speech we don't have anything

683
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,600
freedom of our own identity

684
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:10,320
everything like really i since i born i

685
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
never

686
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,840
see that thing in thailand before

687
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,159
but right now we

688
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,919
we have we have a walk and we have a

689
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,440
like

690
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,760
go near that school like a little while

691
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,960
it's so bad but yeah it's it can

692
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,480
it can be like

693
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,120
for 10 years or maybe

694
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,919
15 years or 116

695
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:40,120
until we reach our goal but

696
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:43,360
i don't think i i will not continue this

697
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,320
pathway until i will

698
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:47,360
like

699
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
accomplish my

700
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,399
my

701
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:53,879
my own job

702
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,919
um

703
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,080
just very quickly

704
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,480
it's getting very emotional here and for

705
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,159
me i'd say

706
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,480
it's quite simple it's not because i'm

707
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,080
optimistic and generally like any

708
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,080
reasonable person won't be like that

709
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,080
optimistic when it comes to situation in

710
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,640
hong kong but is that i simply believe

711
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:14,559
what we're doing is right

712
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,320
we are fighting for things that we

713
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,279
should have democracy freedoms universal

714
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,440
human rights and all those things and

715
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,440
that's the right thing to do and it

716
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,320
doesn't matter what it cost us we have

717
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,200
to do it as she said we haven't finished

718
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,760
ups here and i don't want the next

719
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,240
generation or the kids now in hong kong

720
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,080
have to go through the same thing i

721
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,000
basically want them to have a life full

722
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,559
of bubble tea and milk tea and they can

723
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:44,240
like just live with that it's good yeah

724
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:46,480
yeah thank you um i think that's quite

725
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,679
inspiring

726
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,360
um so we have some audience questions um

727
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,240
i think i will ask two of them together

728
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,760
since they're quite or they're about

729
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
similar topics um and you can answer

730
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,799
either one or both um the first question

731
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,720
is is there an international market for

732
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,320
technologies that enable digital

733
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,480
authoritarianism and who is exporting

734
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,039
that technology and then the second one

735
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,559
is what would you like

736
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,240
technology companies especially internet

737
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,159
companies to do to resist digital

738
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,320
authoritarianism especially given the

739
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,840
legal environments that they are

740
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:20,480
operating in

741
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,519
maybe i can go first and this one i

742
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:27,840
think one of the biggest exports when it

743
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,840
comes to surveillance technology

744
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,679
it's the western world the free world

745
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:36,080
that we're living like we we look up to

746
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,080
to be honest for example in xinjiang we

747
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,200
all know that there's like heavy

748
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:41,519
surveillance and european companies like

749
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:44,080
siemens telefonica they've helped build

750
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,320
that system and that system kind of

751
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,039
reinforced and built the capacity for

752
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,399
beijing's

753
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:51,200
um

754
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,279
power to conduct surveillance and then

755
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,039
they sell this kind of

756
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,039
systems and techniques

757
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,080
to

758
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,320
other authoritarian states and then they

759
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,720
kind of export it so it's not only

760
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:05,440
beijing's fault we also should ask why

761
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,600
are european companies why are u.s

762
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,039
companies

763
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,200
feeling this kind of crackdown

764
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,600
indirectly what are why are they doing

765
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,679
this of course for benefit from money

766
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:17,840
but as countries are we really accepting

767
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,600
that as citizens and we're really okay

768
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,559
with those kind of things so we're

769
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:22,480
pressing our governments to actually

770
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,760
stop the entities on our our land on our

771
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,039
like soil

772
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,799
like doing that are we going to stop

773
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,000
them i think this is one of the

774
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,399
questions and there is clearly a market

775
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:33,760
and high demand of surveillance

776
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,440
technology and

777
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
a lot of the developers actually have

778
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,519
the power to decide where does it go and

779
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:41,600
we should act and put law and

780
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:43,440
regulations in place so that it will not

781
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,960
be happening to other places too

782
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,240
would you want to add to that panacea

783
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,200
yeah

784
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,080
like

785
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:54,799
in

786
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:57,039
oh

787
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:15,639

788

[Music]

790
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,480
yeah i mean i think this is definitely

791
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,559
an issue in myanmar as well we

792
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:56,000
definitely do see

793
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,360
um

794
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,640
chinese

795
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
state-controlled companies that come in

796
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,760
and help

797
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,320
and who helps the previous civilian

798
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,240
government set up the surveillance

799
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,360
systems

800
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,040
but we also saw

801
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,839
the

802
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,639
purchasing of surveillance technology

803
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,520
from

804
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:17,280
various companies especially in europe

805
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,760
and yeah i think there is this really

806
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,839
big issue that people

807
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,000
don't look at that is not just about the

808
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,719
money but it's also this question of

809
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,560
western countries especially wanting to

810
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:31,679
help development uh without really

811
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,960
questioning

812
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,040
who is in control of that and what

813
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,839
happens if and when

814
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,760
these authoritarian leaders decide they

815
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:44,000
want to become even more authoritarian

816
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:47,440
so we have another question

817
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,239
which is what can we do to help build

818
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,879
transnational solidarity to resist

819
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,440
digital repression and

820
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,920
what are some suggestions that you might

821
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,320
have of how we can work together or some

822
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,240
examples that you've seen of people

823
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,720
working together

824
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,399
um and do you want to go first this time

825
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,680
um

826

827
00:36:02,750 --> 00:36:10,849

828
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:19,060
[Music]

829
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,920
yeah i mean i think that's really

830
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,640
important um although i do think there's

831
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,839
also this

832
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,760
danger right of when you don't

833
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,680
necessarily understand or you're not

834
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,720
immersed

835
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,720
in the context of these other countries

836
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,920
and struggles

837
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,280
you know like how do you know you're not

838
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,520
accidentally collaborating

839
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,040
uh with the oppressors who are kind of

840
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,119
pretending or these groups are a bit

841
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:49,040
more suspect you know

842
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
um so i think uh

843
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,560
uh

844
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,000
events like these are always really

845
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,839
great um and they're especially great

846
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,920
when they're in person uh but this is

847
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,320
still really good um in terms of uh

848
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,079
allowing people to

849
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,560
learn about you know activists uh and

850
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,000
organizations that we didn't know

851
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,520
existed before

852
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,040
and then start to make those contexts

853
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,359
and start to build those networks

854
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:13,599
um so chong chang uh would you like to

855
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,760
answer the question as well

856
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,079
yes sure um i'd say one way to

857
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,680
build solidarity against digital

858
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:24,079
repression is for us to all step up our

859
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,560
digital security game

860
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
are we using antoine encryption when

861
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:29,839
we're communicating are you putting

862
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:32,240
people around you at risk because

863
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,839
you may not be an activist yourself but

864
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:35,760
you might have a friend that is actively

865
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,079
in politics or care a lot about those

866
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,160
things and then if you are not careful

867
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,640
enough you might be exposing that person

868
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,599
at risk too and we all step up our game

869
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,920
like as citizens no matter where you are

870
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:50,400
we are actually increasing the cost

871
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,160
of the government authoritarian regimes

872
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,839
to try to crack down on us and that's

873
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,079
very important and when it comes to

874
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,599
digital security we need a lot of

875
00:37:57,599 --> 00:37:59,040
resources

876
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,000
do we

877
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,079
are we in contact with each other so we

878
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,839
should like stick together and talk to

879
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:05,359
each other as she has said like it's

880
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:06,640
very important

881
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,240
we should be able to share these kind of

882
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,760
resources because there's so much

883
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,640
available resources out there and we can

884
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,000
help each other to

885
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,359
adjust it to our context because digital

886
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:18,720
security and all of those things are not

887
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,720
a one-size-fits-all solution

888
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,320
and through that

889
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,800
like process of engaging with with each

890
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,960
other solidarity will be naturally built

891
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:29,119
because we share the same cost and we

892
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,680
share the same skill set and we're

893
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,359
sharing our experience even though it

894
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,599
cannot be directly compared and so we

895
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,160
kind of build solidarity naturally in an

896
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:39,920
organic way like you cannot force

897
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,400
solidarity it has to be organically

898
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,880
developing like the highs between the

899
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,520
milky alliance is an organic project

900
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,520
coming out from one

901
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:52,000
one common thread which is like china's

902
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,640
like um chinese oppression

903
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,359
to india to thailand on different levels

904
00:38:57,359 --> 00:38:59,040
and so we kind of come together and

905
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:01,920
became this really interesting gang that

906
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,079
we have and it originally originated

907
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,480
from a nintendo game like the whole

908
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:08,640
prototype of multi lions is there

909
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,560
because of that really i can't remember

910
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,640
the name of the game but because of the

911
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:14,880
online game that we all play together

912
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,320
and so that's kind of become a very

913
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,839
interesting thing to see that we can all

914
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,440
stand intelligently together in such an

915
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,079
organic way

916
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:26,160
yeah thank you so much um

917
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,520
so i think those are all of our

918
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:30,960
questions for today um i just wanted to

919
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,040
wrap up the session uh by giving out

920
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,880
some closing thoughts summarizing what

921
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,560
was discussed today

922
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:39,680
um so i think some things that uh

923
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,839
came out of this discussion were some

924
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:44,560
common threads between all three

925
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,320
contexts

926
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,280
which is that

927
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:54,000
i can't read my own writing

928
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,880
that

929
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:56,880
you know i think everyone here is uh

930
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,359
quite concerned about what

931
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,320
um

932
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,560
the sort of danger that their work

933
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
produces um not just for themselves but

934
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,040
for their family

935
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:09,760
uh that criticism

936
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,480
oppression and injustice is often taken

937
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,560
by these authoritarian regimes as

938
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:16,319
sedition as a threat to national

939
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,440
security or even terrorism

940
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:21,680
i think some really important and

941
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,160
interesting advice that the panelists

942
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,079
had to give are

943
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,319
first and foremost that you need to

944
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,040
prioritize yourself um i think as

945
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,119
activists it's quite easy to think of

946
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:35,520
the work you're doing as a sacrifice and

947
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,000
to keep sacrificing and keep working

948
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,040
because

949
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:40,480
you know the fight isn't won and the

950
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,640
injustice seems so vast compared to

951
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:44,160
yourself um

952
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,000
but you know going to jail

953
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,280
uh

954
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,920
is in many for many of us is a waste of

955
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,800
our time the waste of the contributions

956
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,319
that we could be making if we were

957
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,839
otherwise not in jail

958
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:58,880
and

959
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,560
we also need to protect our mental

960
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,200
health in order that we can continue to

961
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,440
do this work in the long term

962
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,760
especially if this is not a fight that's

963
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:10,480
going to be won in

964
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,560
either a short amount of time or even

965
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:15,520
necessarily in our lifetimes

966
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,520
another piece of big advice that came

967
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:20,000
out of this discussion was that we need

968
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,000
to be paying attention to and learning

969
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,480
from other movements um you know the

970
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,720
oppressors have common interests as

971
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,200
truncheon was saying um but so do we

972
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
right and so if they can learn from each

973
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,040
other so can we

974
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,480
and the people the power of the people

975
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,960
is always going to be so much stronger

976
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,359
as long as we can get to a place where

977
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:44,240
we are united working together

978
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,760
um

979
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:46,880
i think

980
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,960
another good point that was brought up

981
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,400
also was

982
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,200
about digital security um

983
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,000
and increasing the cost

984
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,040
for these authoritarian regimes and

985
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,359
their their slow worker

986
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,520
uh when it comes to trying to either

987
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:06,480
take apart our movements or um

988
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,200
or try to stop these movements

989
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,160
um i

990
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,680
i'll bring up a tactic that was actually

991
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:19,359
used in myanmar which limit government

992
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,480
is very archaic in the way it functions

993
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:24,640
and one thing that people did at the

994
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,040
beginning to just waste their time

995
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,839
was they programmed bots to just facts

996
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,240
government offices random things

997
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,760
and it just wasted a bunch of their

998
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,000
money and like stopped their ability to

999
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:37,119
communicate

1000
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,599
and i think the sort of like

1001
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:42,160
creativity is also something that is a

1002
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,160
really huge strong point of our

1003
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,599
movements because

1004
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,599
you know we are disproportionately young

1005
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:50,000
we are disproportionately tech savvy

1006
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:52,319
um and even with all this technology all

1007
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:55,040
this money uh that these regimes have

1008
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,680
right like the three of us i'm sure have

1009
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,920
very little money combined together

1010
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:02,400
um and yet we

1011
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
and our groups are able to remain

1012
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,640
relatively free and relatively able to

1013
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,800
continue to do our work

1014
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,240
um

1015
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:14,000
and then um i guess i just want to end

1016
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,640
on a couple notes

1017
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,680
uh

1018
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:21,280
that i found really inspiring about what

1019
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:23,359
uh our two speakers here said

1020
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,000
which is that they are continuing to

1021
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,680
keep fighting because

1022
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,480
the job isn't done

1023
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:31,520
and i think

1024
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:34,079
you know it can be really easy to get

1025
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:35,119
very

1026
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:37,119
disillusioned

1027
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:39,200
and to feel like

1028
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
you've done enough

1029
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,480
or you've personally put in so much

1030
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,520
and there are people in your country who

1031
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,400
you know are relatively happy with the

1032
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,000
status quo

1033
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,280
um

1034
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,680
i think it's really helpful to keep in

1035
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:58,560
mind the idea that uh

1036
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:01,359
panacea was saying about how

1037
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,160
until the job is done until we've won

1038
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,040
um this movement will keep going without

1039
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,280
us and i would rather continue to stay

1040
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,960
fighting with it

1041
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:12,880
um

1042
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,960
and i think what chongqing was saying

1043
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:15,839
about

1044
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:18,480
how what we're fighting for is what is

1045
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,839
right but it's also really important to

1046
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:23,920
remember because it is very draining on

1047
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,520
our mental health you do hear people

1048
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,200
accusing you of all sorts of things

1049
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,560
right of like

1050
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,960
you know being like a collaborator with

1051
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,599
the west or you know often in much more

1052
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,960
sexist violent terms and it can

1053
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,640
sometimes make you question yourself in

1054
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,960
your darkest moments um

1055
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:42,720
but at the end of the day what we're

1056
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:45,119
fighting for is right and the job isn't

1057
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:47,680
and so we will all keep fighting and i

1058
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:50,240
hope everyone who is joining us today

1059
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:54,839
will continue to join us in that fight
