welcome back to the studio we are in

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:08,800
conversation the next 30 minutes with

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,920
dominic day executive director of

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,400
daylight and as usual post your

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,000
questions in the chat box and we'll try

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,039
to get to as many as possible dominique

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,880
welcome to in conversation

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,320
thank you thank you so much for

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,760
including me here

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,320
dominique to start can we get an

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,000
introduction from you and tell us a

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,079
little bit about the work you do

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,360
okay

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,680
i am a human rights and civil rights

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,360
attorney i

16
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,280
sit on the united nations working group

17
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,920
of experts on people of african descent

18
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,399
and i run a program called

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:46,879
daylight which is a racial equity

20
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:49,520
accelerator we look at intersectional

21
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,079
racial justice so racial justice through

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,760
the lenses of

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,559
um

24
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,600
youth women people call uh

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,399
lgbtq people and others to make sure

26
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,600
when we're thinking about race we're

27
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,280
thinking coalitionally and we're

28
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,199
thinking about equity we're looking at

29
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:06,880
everybody

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,360
that's a big big thing to tackle can you

31
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,040
give us a little bit more um what are

32
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,080
some of the things that you're working

33
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:14,080
on right now

34
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,799
so i we just finished in the um we just

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,240
finished our public session we were

36
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,000
looking at the rights of the child of

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,799
african descent and the ways in which

38
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:25,840
people's racialized thinking legacy

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,000
mindsets of enslavement and the slave

40
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,360
the trade and trafficking and enslaved

41
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:31,840
africans colonialism continue to

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,880
perpetuate um really problematic

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,640
decision making today so the ways that

44
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,600
children are adultified black girls are

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,600
hyper-sexualized the way that we make

46
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,040
assumptions about what people are

47
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,640
entitled to

48
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,799
heavily based on our legacy mindsets

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:48,040
around race

50
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,640
exploitability expendability and the

51
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,200
disposability of black hole

52
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
and so what are the things that you can

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,200
do to try to counter that you've

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,880
identified the problem uh you've

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,719
mentioned that you're an attorney tell

56
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,799
us a little bit more

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,320
yeah i mean the opportunities are

58
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,600
endless you know we understand that the

59
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,080
social conditioning of race extends as

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:10,639
far back as the social construct of race

61
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,760
for those trade and trafficking and

62
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
enslaved africans so we're talking about

63
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,520
hundreds of years of almost deputized

64
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,360
racism being built out in different

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,040
sections and so it's really interesting

66
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,560
in the tech sector you see a lot of

67
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,400
people saying that's a weird problem

68
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,080
here's a tech solution to this and so

69
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,239
you've seen if you looked at for example

70
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:29,760
in new jersey in the u.s the force

71
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,720
report um a bunch of young

72
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,160
activists uh with computers managed to

73
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,879
do a massive yield of freedom of

74
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,280
information act information to show

75
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,599
how police for example with

76
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:45,920
the highest number of force complaints

77
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,080
were also the highest decorated and

78
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
awarded at the same time

79
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,640
you know you see other tech solutions

80
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,040
that are highly racialized once we look

81
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,280
at them but harder to dismantle um maybe

82
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,239
an example of this just the other way oh

83
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,159
sorry yeah no definitely please give

84
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,680
give us the example

85
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,280
you know there's a new article that came

86
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,959
out just the other day in the journal of

87
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,319
american medicine

88
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
um that showed that pulse oximetry the

89
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,200
the little light things we've been all

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
downloading on our phones to figure out

91
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
our oxygen during covid and that was

92
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,440
used as a metric of whether or not to

93
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,440
admit people to the hospital has

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:24,560
systemic racial disparities uh for black

95
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,200
and latino patients and actually

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,280
impacted dramatically who received

97
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,280
treatment when they received treatment

98
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,200
and who ultimately was able to live with

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,519
and survive this disease and so it's

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,680
really interesting how much we need to

101
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,080
confront our own bias in order to

102
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,440
actually ensure our tech solutions are

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,920
uh equitable um

104
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,319
even even uh even when unconscious to

105
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,760
ourselves

106
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,159
now this this intersection of tech covet

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,760
and race is something that a lot of

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,439
people have talked about over the last

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,080
uh two years of this pandemic um it's

110
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,760
really tricky what are some of the

111
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,519
issues and the challenges that's making

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,400
it difficult for tech companies to move

113
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,640
more quickly on this

114
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:09,280
i mean if you want my honest answer race

115
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
is uncomfortable race can be expensive

116
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,480
race can be something

117
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,120
um that confronting it we have we have

118
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,798
research on this can be psychologically

119
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,959
devastating so before the pandemic we

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
had research that said emergency doctors

121
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,720
make anti-black pro-white decisions when

122
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,479
they're overwhelmed and stressed and

123
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:30,639
have too many patients yet that wasn't

124
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,800
factored into policy making before the

125
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,479
pandemic we knew a pandemic would be

126
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,880
disproportionately devastating to black

127
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
and latino communities and yet that was

128
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,720
not factored into policy making the

129
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,320
racial disparities we see we saw

130
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,040
throughout the pandemic often failed to

131
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,040
really guide policy makers tech

132
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,320
companies and even social solutions um

133
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,680
and then we've also seen a real

134
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,400
disregard of innovation right and um uh

135
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,960
there's this covadex sexy uh treatment

136
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,520
in uh that a ugandan doctor came up with

137
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,919
ignored by the rest the west african

138
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,000
innovation ignored by the west in favor

139
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,520
of very expensive solutions that are

140
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,720
uh

141
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,960
often accessible only to those of us in

142
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,280
the north and so i think that space

143
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,160
confronting the realities of systemic

144
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,120
racism requires a level of self uh

145
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,080
uh scrutiny that has been prohibited for

146
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,919
people and dominique you mentioned this

147
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,479
uh medical research in uganda i haven't

148
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,240
heard of it perhaps a lot of the

149
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,520
audience haven't can you talk a little

150
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,199
bit about that just so we know what

151
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
you're referencing

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,800
uh yeah so uh

153
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:39,120
i'm not a doctor but as i understand it

154
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,520
there's a it's a it's a liquid spray

155
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,320
called covadex it was developed and it

156
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,680
was a fairly effective treatment for uh

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
as it's been told to me the kind of

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,080
coverage you get in your throat not so

159
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,000
much in your lungs and this was

160
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,840
something that was ultimately approved

161
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,319
by the government in uganda has been uh

162
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,880
used throughout this period and in fact

163
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,440
was protected by the developer from

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,680
being instrumentalized into a highly

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,199
profit-making

166
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:07,280
intervention the idea was to give it to

167
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,880
people and to give it to people widely

168
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,400
and to avoid

169
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
any massive barriers to access

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,840
at the same time you know we've seen a

171
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,560
lot of very expensive solutions stood up

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,080
and protected both by the media and by

173
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
our governments the idea that there's

174
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
really viable innovation coming out of

175
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,720
africa coming out of other spaces that

176
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,319
provide um

177
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,360
cheap affordable and effective solutions

178
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,360
has been disregarded and you have to ask

179
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,440
yourself why at the period that covadex

180
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,160
was being first piloted we didn't have

181
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,680
any solutions on the table we didn't

182
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,080
have vaccines on the table and yet

183
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,680
african innovation was looked at even in

184
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,680
this area where people like me have been

185
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,599
talking about the enduring power of

186
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,639
systemic racism for years african

187
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:57,199
innovation was still seen as though it's

188
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,280
people somewhere in the global south

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
playing in a sandbox rather than real

190
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,759
innovation grounded in a continent's

191
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,880
understanding that only they will save

192
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,360
themselves and that way that that's been

193
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,919
offered to us um it's almost

194
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,520
disappointing that we haven't been able

195
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,840
to really

196
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,639
leverage um our claims of understanding

197
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,039
equality understanding the intelligence

198
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,520
that exists in every space we haven't

199
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,919
been able to leverage that into action

200
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,759
now over the last two years with the

201
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,800
pandemic there has been more discussion

202
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,240
i would say um uh in terms of of race

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,080
for example i think a lot of americans

204
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,479
did not necessarily understand the

205
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:39,440
reason

206
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,000
why certain groups had hesitancy around

207
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,960
the vaccine because of historical uh

208
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,840
reasons do you think that kind of stuff

209
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,160
has been internalized and that there's

210
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,080
been at least some improvement moving

211
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,080
forward or you're looking at a pretty

212
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,919
dismal picture

213
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,919
i mean i don't know that i would say

214
00:07:57,919 --> 00:07:59,599
that there's been improvement right and

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:00,720
partially

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:01,520
is

217
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,039
that's because i don't know that i would

218
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,720
say that people's trust didn't come from

219
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,120
a very real place i was recently in

220
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,720
switzerland doing a country visit and

221
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,879
very many of the meetings we had to have

222
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,080
couldn't take place in government

223
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,560
buildings because a surprising number of

224
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,800
people of african descent there had not

225
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,039
been vaccinated and had chosen not to be

226
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,440
vaccinated right in the in even given

227
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,879
the opportunity

228
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,680
this

229
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,560
partially had to do with an enduring

230
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,400
legacy that

231
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,159
had told them that they may not be safe

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:34,080
in the hands of the state but it also

233
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,919
had to do with the reality of current

234
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,120
policy that tolerated that suborned

235
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,599
entrenched discrimination entrenched

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,919
inequality and so just like here in the

237
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,480
us when you have ongoing policies of

238
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,560
discrimination ongoing policies that

239
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
tolerate risk to black and broad

240
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,080
communities ongoing policies that

241
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,399
deprive childhood to black and brown

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
children it may be harder and harder to

243
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,399
dismantle people's reference point of

244
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,480
the tuskegee syphilis experiments for

245
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,080
example even if it's not a perfect

246
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,480
analogy it may be harder to dismantle

247
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,640
that reference point when people look

248
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,480
around and they see

249
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,360
um

250
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,519
what they feel is evidence of ongoing

251
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,600
governmental disregard that said plenty

252
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,360
of black and brown doctors have have

253
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,279
worked really hard to push out the

254
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,760
vaccine i of course vaccinated but i

255
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,360
have to tell you this is not just an

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
american problem black people all over

257
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,279
the world have felt a real hesitancy

258
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,000
to

259
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
um believe that the government will

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,399
provide a solution where so often it has

261
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,240
failed them and even as it has stepped

262
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,760
up for others

263
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,880
you talk about um challenges that uh

264
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,360
people of african descent face not just

265
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,120
in the united states and

266
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,320
and um

267
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,959
we are on two years after the death of

268
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
uh the murder of george floyd and

269
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,279
um your work being so transnational

270
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,240
i certainly know being based in berlin

271
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,640
actually that's where i'm usually i

272
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,000
usually am

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,880
um

274
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,600
that the black lives matters protests

275
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,240
extended beyond the u.s borders and

276
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,079
there were a lot of people in european

277
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,560
capitals including in berlin uh

278
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
across the continent there uh going out

279
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
to speak uh for racial justice

280
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
and i i i'm curious your thoughts on

281
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,399
that um number one why do you think that

282
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
was the case that uh blm and the

283
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
protests in the united states sparked

284
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:31,360
protests even in tokyo i remember people

285
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,600
came out and do you think the role of

286
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
social media of course had anything to

287
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,120
do with that

288
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,920
yeah absolutely i think social media has

289
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:42,920
been for all of its challenges has has

290
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:45,440
revolutionized our world is defining a

291
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,880
new generation

292
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,120
and still i think a new generation is

293
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,040
not going to help it's not going to be

294
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,040
able to rid us of racism

295
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,880
you know we saw we saw protests in

296
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,720
virtually every capital in the world and

297
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,320
i think part of it

298
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,399
may have been in solidarity

299
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,320
but i think a lot of it also had to do

300
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,480
with people of african descent and

301
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,720
others both experiencing

302
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
analogous situations in their own

303
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
country at the hands of their own police

304
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,200
at the state and people in every country

305
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,440
not wanting that to be the narrative

306
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:18,000
anymore that even people who didn't see

307
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
themselves as potentially at risk from

308
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
the police no longer want to be

309
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,800
associated with um this entrenched

310
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,959
systemic racism whereas where black

311
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
bodies are seen as wholly dispensable to

312
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,240
the point of uh the impunity that was

313
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,079
associated with the

314
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:38,959
um the audacious murder of george floyd

315
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
and i i think that's meaningful right

316
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,800
because at the same time that we were

317
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,800
seeing protests everywhere in the world

318
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,519
we were hearing reports brazil colombia

319
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,120
spain the uk

320
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,839
um escalated police actions particularly

321
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
in black communities i mean obviously

322
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,200
the u.s as well

323
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,680
where it was almost as though the stress

324
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,959
of covid was being released and relieved

325
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,040
on the bodies of black communities and

326
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:05,920
that space i think created a powerful

327
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,800
nexus a powerful through line

328
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,120
race as a powerful through line between

329
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:14,480
coveted police brutality and protest

330
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,639
that actually extended around the world

331
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,320
and so i do think it was a special

332
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:19,440
moment

333
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,720
and i'm struggling with the fatigue that

334
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
many companies seem to have achieved at

335
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,560
this point in terms of their commitment

336
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,639
to substantive change

337
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:32,560
and you mentioned law enforcement so i

338
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,279
know a specific focus of yours is how

339
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
the use of facial recognition technology

340
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,800
and biometric surveillance in

341
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,600
policing has disproportionately impacted

342
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,639
uh black communities talk about that

343
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,200
well you know it's interesting right um

344
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,639
i'm a lawyer so i've been a lawyer for

345
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,600
about 25 years i used to literally be a

346
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,680
public defender and so i would litigate

347
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
police operations right the legality of

348
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,360
a police operation that ultimately

349
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,760
resulted in the arrest of my client and

350
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,760
in that process

351
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,680
you know on some level a police officer

352
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,440
is testing that they want to catch a

353
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,440
person committing a crime and yet

354
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,880
somehow artificial intelligence products

355
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,320
become commercial products on the market

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,720
with racial disparities initially right

357
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,639
of up to 30 40

358
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,760
we saw black women misidentified

359
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,279
um 35 at the time uh just a few years

360
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:30,079
ago with facial recognition uh products

361
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,040
uh misgendered and misraced i should say

362
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,279
and that space where

363
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:37,360
somehow the production of a commercial

364
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,279
product has and even earlier like i was

365
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,800
talking about pulse oximeters a

366
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,959
production of a commercial product has

367
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,560
literally ignored the risk to black bulk

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,240
of being misidentified by a potential um

369
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,160
drone carrying plane that could

370
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
literally drop a bomb on our heads the

371
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,480
risk to black folk of walking through

372
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,760
the airport and being potentially

373
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,920
misidentified the fact that that could

374
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,399
be disregarded in a commercial product

375
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,519
is so unthinkable it reminds us how

376
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
deeply deeply foundational systemic

377
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,839
racism is in america but also

378
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
transnationally right from the from its

379
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,800
inception we have pushed out um the

380
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,480
construct of race in the trade and

381
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,079
trafficking in the slave africans and

382
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,519
now we have another space right where

383
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,160
we're pushing out tactics policies and

384
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,880
equipment including digital ai equipment

385
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,040
for law enforcement for pushing it out

386
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,360
across the world from the united states

387
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,399
and that space continues to reflect

388
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,440
enduring racial legacies and requires

389
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,800
really rigorous immediate attention

390
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,040
so i guess the next question is a big

391
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,000
one uh maybe you can look at it a narrow

392
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,120
version sort of slice of it but what can

393
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,399
be done uh i think i know the answer for

394
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,720
uh the second question which is that

395
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,839
have tech companies been receptive uh to

396
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
this kind of feedback i'm guessing not

397
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,079
as much as you would like so then what

398
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,920
can be done

399
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,560
you know so much can be done i

400
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
when i say not as much as i would like i

401
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,839
would say that

402
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:09,199
there are a lot of people who are

403
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
interested in a training but are people

404
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
interested in a deep audit of their

405
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,519
practices are they interested in mapping

406
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,480
where the holes are the expertise to fix

407
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,079
these problems exists inside the systems

408
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,639
where they survive so

409
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,800
um you know a lot of press was given

410
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,360
recently to the uh

411
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,519
denial of kidney transplants for black

412
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
people unless they were much sicker

413
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
that issue was something that was seen

414
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,720
understood and uplifted by people within

415
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,360
that field you didn't go and hire

416
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
um a racial justice person to say let me

417
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,519
just look at all of your protocols

418
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,560
somebody

419
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,560
who understood the protocol and had a

420
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,720
sense it was racist came to talk to

421
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,279
someone like me and to figure out how to

422
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,079
actually articulate the connection

423
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
between an existing medical protocol of

424
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
today that's been stripped of all its

425
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,959
racialized content and the legacies of

426
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,360
our racialized history and so that

427
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,680
expertise it exists in every field it

428
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
exists in every office it exists in

429
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
every newsroom and that's something that

430
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,480
needs to be actually leveraged but those

431
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,839
voices are voices that have

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
overwhelmingly been disregarded that

433
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
haven't been mentored that are lesser

434
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,720
promoted that are lesser recognized as

435
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,920
valuable and whose discourse is often

436
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:28,480
limited to putting our faces

437
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,120
up front when a race issue shows up so

438
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,600
some of it is about how do you actually

439
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,160
acknowledge or build the expertise to

440
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,360
take a critical look um inside of every

441
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,839
system right systemic racism is about

442
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,320
growing racism in systems and some of it

443
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,639
is about make your racial interventions

444
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:49,759
look less like a pronouncement of black

445
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
lives matter and more like a rigorous

446
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,839
dismantling of uh of

447
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,240
of what's already there a rigorous

448
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,600
interrogation of how your discomfort may

449
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,720
be a barrier to the kind of equity and

450
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,760
equality you claim to

451
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,720
value and and be striving towards

452
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,319
and dominique we're going to get to

453
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,799
questions very soon but i wanted to

454
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,079
perhaps end on a brighter note for this

455
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,240
uh segment of our conversation you

456
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,720
talked about african innovation earlier

457
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,640
i mean i wonder if we can circle back

458
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,599
and and

459
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,119
give you the opportunity to talk a

460
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,840
little bit more and how do you think

461
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,160
um this innovation can be shared to the

462
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,280
world uh you say that there's systems in

463
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,200
place that make it so that it's

464
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,559
difficult for people to pay attention so

465
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,320
what are some of your suggestions for

466
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,919
people to better understand what's

467
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:45,120
happening

468
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,600
it's it's it's a young continent there's

469
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,640
so much uh knowledge and so much

470
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,480
learning being done there

471
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,160
that i think it's super interesting and

472
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
a lot of people listening probably want

473
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,559
to learn more

474
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,919
i guess i would say it's an old

475
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:02,960
continent and the reality

476
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,280
is that people have

477
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,320
often

478
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,760
um

479
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,799
taken a lot of responsibility for how

480
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,320
they tackle a problem um africans did

481
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,160
well in covet and this is sort of a

482
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,760
really broad rush for a really big

483
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,559
continent but did well in covid because

484
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,640
of the experience as the prior pandemics

485
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,200
because of the sense of community

486
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,120
and because of the belief and reliance

487
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,360
on innovation that existed and so

488
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,799
um i think the first thing if the west

489
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,120
wants to look at africa as a country in

490
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
the way that we often do the first thing

491
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
would be maybe to see think about it

492
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,840
less extractively right how do we

493
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,520
actually understand

494
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,520
an equal playing field with an equal

495
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
level of respect and an equal

496
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,160
willingness to share profit power and

497
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,640
privilege how do we understand african

498
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
innovation as um necessary to and um uh

499
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,799
equal to uh western innovation and then

500
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,919
how do we actually uplift rather than um

501
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,160
squelch solutions that are actually

502
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
grounded in mutual aid the um you know

503
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
uh we saw in cuba during covet a

504
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,760
tremendous amount of mutual aid being

505
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,720
pushed out we saw in uh the covadex

506
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,480
vaccine i was telling you about a

507
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,120
tremendous spirit that this was not

508
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,280
going to be something that one doctor

509
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:24,799
was able to leverage into enormous

510
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,080
profit but instead something that would

511
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,480
continue to benefit community that

512
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,600
spirit that spirit of mutual aid of uh

513
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,640
of we are all one we are accountable to

514
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,760
each other

515
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
cannot and should not be placed up

516
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,320
against the idea of intellectual

517
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,559
property or the idea of wealth

518
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,600
accumulation instead should be respected

519
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,480
and valued and given primacy if not you

520
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,720
know equality if not primacy

521
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,640
great and just to clarify when i said

522
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,720
young continent i wasn't clear i meant

523
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,440
demographically um we will go to

524
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,679
questions now the first one is from

525
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:03,120
isedua how can we push companies to go

526
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,360
beyond dei initiatives it seems that

527
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:06,880
many companies just point to the

528
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,360
existence of the initiative as a

529
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:11,679
sufficient indication they are working

530
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,679
to address systemic racism in their

531
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
business operations or services

532
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,400
absolutely and in fact there's research

533
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,360
that

534
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,799
you know there's a moral licensing

535
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,280
effect people appoint a chief direct

536
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,679
chief diversity officer and ultimately

537
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,039
feel like they've done enough and

538
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,320
eventually that person reports to

539
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
somebody lower and lower and lower until

540
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,000
they walk away if they actually are

541
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,679
invested in the integrity of their of

542
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,320
their work and and and

543
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,000
that is something that needs to be

544
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
driven internally so i mean i would say

545
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,240
that there has been a real investment in

546
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,320
superficial um language of solidarity in

547
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,520
virtue signaling and book clubs and uh

548
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
getting everyone's awareness up to a

549
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:56,559
certain level and there's probably some

550
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,120
value in that and yet as i was saying in

551
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,720
each of these areas in each of these

552
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,960
fields and each of these systems the way

553
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,679
that racism actually operates to exclude

554
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,840
to minimize certain people to diminish

555
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,960
certain voices to limit innovation right

556
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,280
to focus much more on incrementalist

557
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,679
thinking than real innovation that might

558
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,799
require a really disruptive uh critical

559
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,760
eye

560
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,440
that's something that that expertise

561
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,360
exists within the idea of what it is to

562
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,000
include rather than assimilate exists

563
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,480
within and those are conversations that

564
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,760
require some discomfort some listening

565
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,919
and also the uplifting of voices that

566
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:39,200
are often delegitimized and so i think

567
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
that is something that needs to be there

568
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,720
needs to be demand from within in

569
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,880
certain companies and also perhaps there

570
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,720
needs to be a real reckoning with what

571
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,039
are the costs of business as usual what

572
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,760
are the costs of incrementalist thinking

573
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,760
as my father used to call it he was a he

574
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,840
was an inventor and an innovator and

575
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
worked for a big corporation right and

576
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,640
also

577
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,320
and so this was the biggest insult you

578
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,440
could have in my childhood that you were

579
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,840
an incrementalist thinker and yet in the

580
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:07,760
diversity space we see how

581
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
strongly the desire is that diversity

582
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,000
personnel protect management from

583
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,720
lawsuits rather than truly create an

584
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,799
inclusive and innovative community and

585
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:17,840
that's something that the

586
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,799
dissatisfaction with that needs to be

587
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,159
resoundingly heard within and often by

588
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:27,520
the people whose fame whose power inside

589
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,240
these systems um could possibly drive a

590
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,840
change in conversation

591
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,200
and as you say it makes them

592
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,360
uncomfortable

593
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,679
lyanna asks what is a trend that you're

594
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,159
noticing in terms of surveillance like

595
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,120
how it physically manifests she says i

596
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,200
think digital rights issues particularly

597
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,640
their effects on marginalized

598
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,640
communities can

599
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
have a barrier to understanding it's a

600
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,880
type of police violence that's not

601
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,360
immediately visible and happens behind

602
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,200
closed doors

603
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:59,600
absolutely and increasingly behind

604
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,679
closed doors right this is the problem

605
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:03,360
with artificial intelligence for all the

606
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
amazing things it's giving us it's

607
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,520
harder and harder in courts and in

608
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,760
communities to really unravel

609
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,440
um what surveillance is actually

610
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,600
happening and what's driving it and so

611
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,520
you know i think for

612
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,080
uh racialized people for people whose

613
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
ancestors were subject to the terror and

614
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,760
the surveillance and the control of

615
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,640
enslavement and and the post-slavery

616
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,760
period you also have this recognition

617
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,840
that this is a bit more of the same

618
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:34,640
right the idea that i'm getting my my

619
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
retina skin almost every time i cross a

620
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,200
border um doesn't feel like a big

621
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,600
invasion of privacy to some and yet

622
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,799
there are those of us who understand

623
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,480
that's a form of surveillance that could

624
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:46,720
immediately be converted into violence

625
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,799
because it has been um and because it

626
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,679
continues to be and so i think

627
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,240
perhaps um you know we're in a different

628
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:55,840
moment where privacy means something

629
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,120
very different

630
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,960
to the younger generation than it does

631
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,840
to the older generation but surveillance

632
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
and the idea that you um

633
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,559
your ability to walk through the world

634
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,400
your liberty means something very

635
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,000
different if you're black versus if

636
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,919
you're white but that is something that

637
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,840
younger generation really gets and so to

638
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,240
me the different definition of liberty

639
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,080
based on your race the idea that the

640
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,039
next door app is popping off every time

641
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,360
a black person is walking through the

642
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,880
neighborhood and the neighbors are out

643
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,000
there craning um is a different form of

644
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,120
liberty a different form of stress of

645
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,039
racial stress you're asked to take on

646
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:36,720
and that space um has has only increased

647
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,200
even though perhaps the image of the

648
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
police officer and the cruiser or the

649
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,559
police officer on the beat stepping

650
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:45,039
stepping to you directly may not be as

651
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,039
apparent in some communities that

652
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:50,080
surveillance we know is beating um uh

653
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,520
it's feeding weaponry it's feeding

654
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,799
airports it's feeding who gets um who

655
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,080
gets targeted in all sorts of uh ways

656
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,159
that are deeply problematic from a human

657
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:01,760
rights standpoint and i say deeply

658
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,200
problematic but obviously i mean

659
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,320
inhumane and atrocious and that space of

660
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,360
surveillance um is it's a blanket at

661
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,840
this point and it's a racialized blanket

662
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,799
and so

663
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,279
i think as the discomfort with oh it's

664
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,559
just the police asking for your

665
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:18,000
identification

666
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,880
um does it feel like a big deal to folks

667
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
they can look very easily and see what

668
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:25,120
surveillance policies lead to in terms

669
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,360
of drones in terms of airport detentions

670
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,520
in terms of um the ways in which people

671
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,520
may be detained with without counsel

672
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,600
with or without notice to their family

673
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,039
and and so maybe you have to dig a

674
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:36,400
little deeper but it's an important

675
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,240
amount of digging to do because the

676
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,559
surveillance and control of black bodies

677
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,960
is as foundational to america as apple

678
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
pie probably more so

679
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,600
and leanna asks defund the police is

680
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,640
gaining traction do you have any advice

681
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,960
on how activists can push to defund

682
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,240
surveillance tech weaponized by police

683
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
and what are you seeing as a pressure

684
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,559
point companies and politicians don't

685
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,200
have many incentives to address

686
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,760
surveillance tech is it

687
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,559
risky to companies bottom lines or is it

688
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,679
bad pr or something else that will help

689
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,559
push the needle forward um and i guess

690
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,240
there's also some debate whether defund

691
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,360
the police is gaining traction

692
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,799
yeah i think this is another one of

693
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,240
these areas where it seems to be going

694
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
up and down with um

695
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,760
uh with what's in the media and i have

696
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,440
to say um i like most lawyers who know

697
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,559
what they're doing we're trying to

698
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,799
actually take our talking points from

699
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:38,559
the activists from the youth from the

700
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,120
voices on on the ground right it's

701
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,440
problematic if i'm sitting in the u.n

702
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,880
um uh

703
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,039
not reflecting what i'm hearing in my

704
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,360
own communities and so i think in terms

705
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,600
of defund i'm hopeful that the

706
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,279
conversation that's happening which is

707
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,520
that the police are a remarkably

708
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,799
ineffective intervention against um

709
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,960
mental health challenges a remarkably

710
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,080
ineffective intervention against the

711
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,480
sort of punishing of adolescence that

712
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,720
has them pushing a lot of kids into the

713
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,559
school-to-prison pipeline who would

714
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,640
actually age into

715
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,960
really lovely adults with a little

716
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,279
adolescent horseplay which is not just

717
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,360
normal but biological it turns out we

718
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,200
have really great research on this and

719
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,320
so to me the defund platform is really

720
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,440
grounded in a demand for community as we

721
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:29,360
always knew community

722
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,320
until more recently and the demand for

723
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:33,760
accuracy you know when we're talking

724
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,360
about funding our money we look at

725
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,440
metrics and we say are you succeeding

726
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:39,679
and yet the war on drugs has succeeded

727
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,679
in nothing beyond criminalizing a

728
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,600
generation of black and brown men

729
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,000
certainly hasn't succeeded in reducing

730
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,200
the proliferation or even the impact of

731
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,840
narcotics and so in that space where the

732
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:55,600
police are often um achieving a metric

733
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,440
that is not the metric they're supposed

734
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
to be achieving which is prevention of

735
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:02,559
community uh crime and protection of

736
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,240
community safety you have to ask

737
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
yourself who's actually

738
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,399
profiting who's actually benefiting and

739
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,480
in this space it's very clear that

740
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,240
community interventions particularly if

741
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,520
they're going to be state community

742
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,679
interventions don't actually need to

743
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:17,120
criminalize people in order to be

744
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,200
effective just the opposite they need to

745
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:23,120
support both innovation and education um

746
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,440
no matter how people learn that includes

747
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,320
creating spaces for people to have

748
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,440
neurodiverse interventions and become

749
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,039
really beautiful

750
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,960
powerful contributing members of our

751
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,679
society rather than you know that

752
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,360
autistic kid who was killed on his lawn

753
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,080
by the police

754
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,360
