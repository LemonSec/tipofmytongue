box and we'll get to as many questions

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,439
as possible now jawad fairus is chairman

8
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,080
and founder of salaam for democracy and

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,240
human rights he's a former bahraini

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,320
member of parliament who resigned in

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,439
2011 over the government's violent

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:33,600
response to protesters during the arab

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,840
spring he was later detained and

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,760
tortured and while overseas he was

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,000
stripped of his citizenship

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,680
and essentially he's become stateless

17
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,840
and been living in exile ever since so

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,399
statelessness is an issue that he very

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,800
much advocates for some of you may

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,039
already have seen him he presented a

21
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,120
lightning talk entitled are human rights

22
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,840
linked to good governance bahrain and

23
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,359
the 2022 parliamentary elections and uh

24

25
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,359
session

26
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
jawad fairus

27
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,200
welcome

28
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
thanks a lot michelle and good to be

29
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,680
with you and with the rest of our

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,520
audience today

31
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,479
um i'd like to start with

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,640
your status statelessness this is

33
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,159
something that happens to a lot of

34
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,520
people

35
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
certainly in my personal experience i've

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,360
interviewed uyghurs overseas uh they

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,680
hold a chinese passport uh they were

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,280
living and working overseas and you can

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,079
well imagine that there was no desire to

40
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:37,040
go back to china uh where they would

41
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,759
inevitably be a put in detention camp so

42
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,479
many uyghurs have stayed overseas uh and

43
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,560
their passport has uh their passports

44
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,520
have expired or even when they go to the

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,640
chinese embassy the chinese embassy has

46
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,680
you know

47
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,479
essentially ripped their passport apart

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,360
so can you give people a sense of what

49
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,399
it means to be stateless and

50
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,079
the limits of how you can live

51
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,719
unfortunately one of the biggest grave

52
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,280
humanized violation which is ongoing in

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,560
this planet that uh

54
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,480
there are stateless people

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,200
and the most great part of it that

56
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
if you already have a nationality and by

57
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:22,879
sudden your nationality will be revoked

58
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,680
and you become statements like my case

59
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,480
and the clear sequence of it that you're

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,519
going to be unknown person at the same

61
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:34,239
time all your basic rights you it will

62
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,959
be deprived and and saying that that

63
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,200
you don't have an official document you

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,519
cannot travel you cannot have the basic

65
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:46,000
services either way state you are living

66
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,680
in or your own country and even all your

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,879
civil political rights will be deprived

68
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
usually i call it it's like a social

69
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,160
death

70
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,840
that it's look like you are not existing

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,560
and the whole entire your day-to-day

72
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,040
life will be so complicated that you

73
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,519
cannot be engaged we have this

74
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,000
phenomenon on this planet unfortunately

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,760
although unhcr they launched a campaign

76
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,560
i belong since 2014 and there are a huge

77
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,040
international campaigns with so many

78
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,400
international ngos and you and uh

79
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,560
humanized buddies that try to challenge

80
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,879
it but as i can see and

81
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,319
especially when someone like me that

82
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,560
already had a nationality been elected

83
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
member and by sudden his nationality

84
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,480
will be uh

85
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
revoked due to the political decisions

86
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,440
without any judicial

87
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,640
process without any clear evidence just

88
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
due to

89
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,599
uh wish and the demand of the political

90
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,720
authorities to uh target and

91
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,200
revenge from their political opinions

92
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,599
even if they are being elected members

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,360
like my case i've been elected as a

94
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
counselor for four years and elected

95
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
member of the parliament for five to six

96
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,560
years yet i could find the buy sudan and

97
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,200
my case is being built by the

98
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
authorities

99
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,880
as an opponent and then they revoked my

100
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,399
nationality it started in november 2012

101
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,040
and they gradually increased the

102
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
revoking nationality of the citizens uh

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,560
till it reached almost 909

104
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,280
so

105
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,759
i think now the time comes that

106
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
international committee should have all

107
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
joint effort to either to to solve

108
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,919
gradually the issue of the statedness or

109
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,240
to prevent any states revoke the

110
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,880
nationality of their citizens

111
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,440
thank you so much for sharing that now

112
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,520
can you tell me a little bit about your

113
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,680
organization salaam for democracy and

114
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,080
human rights

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:54,880
yes

116
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,840
we mainly focus over three main issue

117
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,039
human rights sustainable development and

118
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,360
political reforms through

119
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,080
adopting uh democratic principles

120
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,440
measures and so on we believe that

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,720
the security and stability in this final

122
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,160
planet can be maintained if each state

123
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,520
adopted

124
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,080
this comprehensive package

125
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,120
of

126
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,759
evaluation through first of all they

127
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,000
have to have a continuous political

128
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,360
reform by adapting democratic value

129
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,280
then they should have a sustainable

130
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,639
developments

131
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:34,560
a program part of the governmental

132
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,600
programs all that should be based on the

133
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,160
human rights principles which is going

134
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
to be a part of the international human

135
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,639
rights convention and so on so we are

136
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
encouraging a lot this type of the

137
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:49,840
adaptation and we are engaged on a lot

138
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,320
of activities campaigns and so on and

139
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,680
meantime we focus in general in the mena

140
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,919
and then the gulf region and in in

141
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:00,639
general and specifically in in bahrain

142
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:03,280
where we are in contact with the victims

143
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,039
we are asking for

144
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,160
that accountability and we try to spread

145
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,240
as much as we can the awareness about

146
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:12,800
the human rights values and we believe

147
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,720
that more people and especially the

148
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,800
victims and their family they are in

149
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,560
contact with the

150
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,280
different u.n treaty bodies and they are

151
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,560
aware of their basic human rights more

152
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,160
there can and

153
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,440
make a good campaign and and and reduce

154
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
whatever harassment and targeting is

155
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
being opposed to them but at the end it

156
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,680
showed all that uh to be related to the

157
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
local legislation which we are fighting

158
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,680
for to

159
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,639
amend and upgrade the the the local

160
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,720
legislation to be the standard of

161
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,120
international conventions of the human

162
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,960
rights

163
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,720

164
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,680

in the mena region i want to go back to

166
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,720

167
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,680
now

168
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,599
started out during that period of the

169
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,080
arab spring and the organization as you

170

00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:10,080
in tunisia in 2019 i'm curious what you

172
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
think where do things stand in the

173
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,560
middle east particularly the gulf a

174
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,880
decade later after the arab spring and

175
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
seems really grim

176
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
first of all we can see due to the

177
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
likeness of the any adaptation of the

178
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,599
continuous political reform as i

179
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
indicated due to

180
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,919
uh

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,360
on on

182
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,440
unrealistic measures where the

183
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,319
authorities they deal with opposition in

184
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
general and absence of freedom of speech

185
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
freedom of assembly

186
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,879
absence of the basic political rights

187
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,520
and civil rights we can see such

188
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,440
uprising is continuing uh occasionally

189
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,720
if we can take bahrain as example since

190
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,400
a century

191
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,440
and we can see this each decade we are

192
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,720
facing uh an uprising because

193
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,720
the basic citizenship right is in

194
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,479
absence and

195
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:10,639
people are demanding that

196
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,879
they want to have their basic rights

197
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,039
with regard to the better income

198
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,879
political rights uh

199
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,479
their human rights to be respected and

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,440
so on so um

201
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,479
after the arab spring uh sparked and

202
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,120
tunisia and in december 2010 as everyone

203
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,680
knows that as has been spreaded in an

204
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,958
arab war

205
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:37,760
uh and in in in egypt and in yemen in

206
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,120
syria and it continued in bahrain

207
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
bahrain was part of it although bahrain

208
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,040
and being in in so much

209
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:50,959
type of the political crisis sin is a

210
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,800
long long time back but it was a chance

211
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,279
that for the people to be in the street

212
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,680
and demand their their basic rights and

213
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,560
demand that their reform and power share

214
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
in the government as we can

215
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,519
realize that bahrain unfortunately it is

216
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,880
an absolute monarchy or entire power in

217
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,920
the hand of the ruling family all three

218
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:12,959
bodies

219
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,600
legislative body executive body and

220
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,440
judiciary body in the hand of the ruling

221
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,279
family and the people demanded their

222
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,640
rights and at the beginning it was a

223
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,920
good turnout and i believe that it was a

224
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,720
good chance for some uh a positive

225
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,200
change on that region in a region in

226
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,120
general in the gulf and part with

227
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,480
bahrain but unfortunately due to what

228
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:39,360
been called the counter revolutionary

229
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
governments and and states all that

230
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,240
being collapsed

231
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,040
and

232
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,680
with the with the let me say silence of

233
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,920
the western government and maybe

234
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,040
sometimes is being looked at the type of

235
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,040
the conspiracy with these

236
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,320
governments

237
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,640
that the counter-revolutionary uh uh

238
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,440
succeeded to suppress and

239
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,480
to crash all these type of the political

240
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,760
uprising and now we can see that

241
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,720
entire control is in the hand of these

242
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
governments uh it's been controlled has

243
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
been called uh by a security iron fist

244
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,480
and the basics rights are being

245
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,839
suppressed

246
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,720
there is no chance for any type of the

247
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,399
freedom of expression freedom of

248
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,640
assembly and the rest and as i indicated

249
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,040
many many human grave human rights

250
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,519
violations have been acted starting with

251
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,519
the continuous of death penalty

252
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,320
systematic torture revocation of

253
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,720
nationality and the

254
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,720
forcible deportation of the country

255
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,480
which we have it like in bahrain after

256
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,320
your nationality will be revoked you

257
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,480
will be expelled out of the country

258
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:00,320
forcibly and the same with time whenever

259
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:03,040
you are active and you could be targeted

260
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:06,240
your family could be targeted uh and and

261
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,040
and and a lot of type of the

262
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,600
discrimination is being been imposed now

263
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,240
the question is that is this going to be

264
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,720
like a continuous way of the government

265
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,360
that they can have control i believe it

266
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,360
is going to be very very short term

267
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,800
because it is

268
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,560
opposing what

269
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,320
we can believe that

270
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:29,120
the security and the stability will be

271
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,360
only maintained through

272
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,320
a power share through the the human

273
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
rights respects and the continuous

274
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,279
political reforms in absence on these

275
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,480
three

276
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,600
continuous demands of the basic rights i

277
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,519
think the stability will not be there so

278
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:48,640
i'm expecting that uh after a while

279
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,839
maybe we're gonna uh uh facing another

280
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,320
wave of arab spring uh

281
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,760
more or less because uh the people still

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
they think that their basic right as a

283
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,040
citizen is not being demanded we have a

284
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
lot of

285
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,760
financial

286
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,279
service type of the demand has not been

287
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,760
provided by the government and and

288
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:12,480
and

289
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,240
considering that even they are not

290
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,240
elected government

291
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
so uh i believe that in your future we

292
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,399
can

293
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,600
face another wave of the arab spring

294
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,000
now you mentioned um in

295
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,079
that there are parliamentary elections

296
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
later this year

297
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
i'm assuming that uh you're not quite

298
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
hopeful of the results of that given

299
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,160
what you've just told us about the way

300
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,839
the government is structured

301
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,800
unfortunately we can hear a lot of

302
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,760
high quality type of the democratic

303
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,880
values or names like election

304
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,040
municipality election parliamentary

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,480
election even we can see some human

306
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,480
rights uh bodies within these

307
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,279
governments but it is only only being

308
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,839
used as a tool to

309
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,560
a

310
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,279
uh

311
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,880
whitewash these governments uh for

312
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:11,519
example in bahrain uh when it comes to

313
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,680
the parliamentary election the the

314
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:16,399
national assembly bahrain consists of

315
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,120
two houses the upper one uh which is

316
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,079
elected body they have the all power

317
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,480
which is elected and appointed it is

318
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,959
appointed house appointed by the king

319
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,800
they have the same number and the same

320
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,480
power as elected house elected house the

321
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,680
constituency has been drawn by the uh

322
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
king himself and

323
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,600
all the political oppositions groups has

324
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:45,120
been banned by law after they pass a law

325
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,240
and then their members and the leaders

326
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,240
are banned from any political

327
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,079
participation they cannot candidate

328
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,320
themselves they extended that one to

329
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,079
included over

330
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,120
of any civil society's election that

331
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,880
they have been banned to be part of it

332
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
so they cannot be even part of any sport

333
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,160
club or

334
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,760
charity funds or even any type of the of

335
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,079
of the of the unions labor unions or

336
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:14,240
women union and so on so totally they

337
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,079
have been banned to

338
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,399
their basic political rights so in such

339
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,519
conditions

340
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,560
are you expecting to have free and fair

341
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,519
election are you expecting to have a for

342
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:28,079
a representative of the people through

343
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,000
elected house and and even if we can

344
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,639
have a few individuals but with the

345
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,279
limitation of their power what they

346
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
don't have and they left the full power

347
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,760
right to either to

348
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,600
monitor or to pass legislation in favor

349
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,920
of the rights of the people so it will

350
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,160
be end up like a a decorative type

351
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,560
prismatic type of the election cosmetic

352
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,040
type of the parliament i believe that

353
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,000
without agreement through a national

354
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,199
dialogue to reach to the um

355
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:07,199
consolidation on having a free election

356
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,240
and independent uh judicionary

357
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,839
uh and and and and the legislation uh

358
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,760
bodies and and elected or uh uh directly

359
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,639
or indirectly governments with that and

360
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,120
they were ensuring that the full power

361
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:27,279
of the parliament to be and and service

362
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,720
based on the one man one vote uh and and

363
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,120
for sure security for all without that

364
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,920
one we will not get uh a right track

365
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
toward stability security and continuous

366
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,959
reform so once again for sure the coming

367
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,199
election in bahrain in the absence of

368
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,800
good governors and without any

369
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:50,800
accountability and without adaptation of

370
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,600
transitional justice it will be really

371
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,399
cosmetic

372
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,839
once again like it's been in

373
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:59,759
2012 2014

374
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,639
2018 and coming one in november this

375
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,320
year

376
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,399
now rights khan is at the intersection

377
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,560
of human rights and technology so i want

378
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,160
to pivot to

379
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,839
talk a little bit about that during the

380
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,320
arab spring as as you know

381
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,880
um it was discovered that bahraini

382
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,120
pro-government hackers

383
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,600
targeted human rights activists during

384
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
that time with the software created by a

385
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,759
german company uh finfisher

386
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,199
to try to spy on them nowadays we have

387
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,920
the israeli company pegasus another

388
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,639
software that many state actors have

389
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,480
used including states in the global

390
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,120
south and there's been a lot of media

391
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:44,000
outcry both during finfisher and the

392
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,959
case

393
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:47,440
of pegasus the use of surveillance

394
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,519
software by states

395
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,160
not for ostensibly law enforcement

396
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,440
reasons but to target activists how do

397
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,160
you think we can stop this there's been

398
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,279
so much media outrage and outrage among

399
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,440
the activist communities but it doesn't

400
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,439
seem to stop these software surveillance

401
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,599
companies from selling to states and

402
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:12,880
from states from abusing them

403
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,799
unfortunately this is one of the shame

404
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,240
act

405
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,799
by the uh some authorities in the in the

406
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:21,280
mena region and it is so clear that

407
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,760
bahrain used the the the

408
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,640
this uh type of the the spywares

409
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,080
either in 2010 and with this uh german

410
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,480
type of the software uh for fine

411
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,160
pressure and

412
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,120
many bahraini activists uh

413
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,360
during that time they've been abroad

414
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,679
they've been targeted and their

415
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
emails and

416
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,400
other software that they used to use has

417
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,799
been targeted and

418
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,360
actively whatever they used to

419
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,679
communicate has been monitored and once

420
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,320
again as you indicated the the biggest

421
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:01,200
one the recent one uh clear evidence

422
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,799
being given and

423
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,360
many international media covered during

424
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,679
that time that many bahraini

425
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,280
human rights defenders and not for once

426
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,039
even some of them their mobile has been

427
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,200
hacked for eight times like episode

428
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,240
assayer some other lawyers in bahrain

429
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,720
and some were activists abroad

430
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,440
it is shown that it is like a systematic

431
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,720
tactic and

432
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,000
systematic

433
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,960
mythology by these authorities to how to

434
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,080
hack and uh try to penetrate

435
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,799
all the electronic stuff or or software

436
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,200
of the activists and i believe that now

437
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
right time comes that internationally we

438
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,840
have to pass

439
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,600
international convention to prevent it

440
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,799
and prohibit all the states to use such

441
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,360
software it is totally should be now

442
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,039
illegal act and

443
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,280
our country will use it there should be

444
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,960
certain sequences

445
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,840
and and some type of the punishment to

446
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,480
be applied without that one i'm i'm

447
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,600
afraid that such bad act and and roman

448
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,960
act will be continued by these

449
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,200
authorities and governments

450
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
thank you so much i want to turn to

451
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,280
questions now

452
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,919
someone is asking what your message is

453
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,000
to governments that claim that

454
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,240
protecting human rights goes against

455
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,200
national security this is something that

456
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:25,760
i suspect is often repeated by many uh

457
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,480
leaders of gulf states you've heard this

458
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,960
one before

459
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,760
yes i think unfortunately it is a claim

460
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,720
not seriously there is willing to

461
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,840
protect the basic rights of the human

462
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,400
being i think the main principle of any

463
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,799
legislation which we passed would

464
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,120
related to the security should be based

465
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
on the human rights value we cannot

466
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:52,240
penetrate our basic rights due to the

467
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,559
claim that because we want to protect

468
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,120
the security all that one should be

469
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,039
within the international conventions

470
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,600
that all of us who agreed to be within

471
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,840
the mechanism of the united nations

472
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,520
without that one and without

473
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,640
international agreement which should be

474
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,000
part of our basic human rights i think

475
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
this type of the legislations or the

476
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:17,200
accusations who shouldn't be accepted

477
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
and should be rejected unfortunately we

478
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
know that so many governments like

479
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,080
bahraini governments they use a lot

480
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,679
terminology of

481
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,720
fighting the the terrorism uh

482
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,080
to to to target and and and limit

483
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,840
the activities of the human rights

484
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,440
defenders so what they do they try to

485
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,880
amend

486
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,520
so many local legislation to say that it

487
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,000
is going to be targeted to to to to to

488
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,400
to fight against the terrorist

489
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,039
act but actually this target against the

490
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,320
activists and prevent them to

491
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,520
practice their basic rights so in short

492
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,840
most important that it should be within

493
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,919
the boundary of the human rights any

494
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,280
legislation going to be passed and

495
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,720
within the boundary of international

496
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,280
conventions within the the u.n

497
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,039
conventions

498
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:08,080
thank you

499
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,360
now um

500
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,840
a participant by the name of abeer wants

501
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,919
you to comment on the situation with

502
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,679
tunisia

503
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,760
and the status of the democracy there i

504
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,480
know there's um

505
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,640
sort of a problem with the parliament

506
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,880
right now i don't know how closely you

507
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,360
follow tunisia but any thoughts on

508
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,840
that

509
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:32,320
country as a general rules is that

510
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,200
any particular individuals either he is

511
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,559
a president or he is a king or whatever

512
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:40,320
being called you shouldn't have the full

513
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,360
power

514
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,919
to freeze the constitution or to

515
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,880
dissolve the parliament and i believe

516
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,000
that the democratic process are so clear

517
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,280
on this regard the basic thing that if

518
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,120
there is any dispute there should be

519
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,000
either through a clear dialogue with all

520
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,480
political parties and all the activists

521
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,840
and here emphasize the role of the ngos

522
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,000
secondly the referendum they're they're

523
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,880
the going to to the poll stations to the

524
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,840
elections that should solve the problem

525
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,400
not to depend on the military not to the

526
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
end on dissolving

527
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,880
a role of the parliament not to depend

528
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,600
on freezing the any article of the

529
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,840
constitution constitution should

530
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,799
continue as active as all the time and

531
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,039
we should take

532
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,280
any type of the military intervention

533
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,159
away from any our political disputes

534
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,480
only through the dialogue and then

535
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,799
agreeing to go to the early election all

536
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,559
that could be solved but unfortunately

537
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:42,880
yet in tunisia that is not being

538
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
practiced and and we believe on that uh

539
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,440
that the tunisian political activities

540
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,240
and

541
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,679
the role of the ngo is so so long and i

542
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,159
hope that all of them can get together

543
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,039
and try to practice peacefully whatever

544
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,280
pressure they can to maintain the

545
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,000
democracy and and to be as a model for

546
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,320
the rest of the arab world to have a

547
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,799
transitional of power in the same time a

548
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,679
very

549
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:12,720
democratic process to any changes

550
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,240
occurring in this

551
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
country

552
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,760
great thank you another question is

553
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,919
asking about how civil society around

554
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:21,760
the world can support activists

555
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,400
especially those expressing themselves

556
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,039
online especially

557
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,360
since activists are being targeted by

558
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,919
their governments

559
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,360
yes for sure we need to enhance the role

560
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,080
of the ngos i believe that any

561
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,480
democratic process without the role of

562
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,919
the ngos is going to be a

563
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,720
a

564
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,320
a short one and going to be uncomplete

565
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,559
we need to enhance the role of the ngos

566
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,440
and we knew we need to have a unity and

567
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,960
more cooperation

568
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,520
and contacts with with ngos

569
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:00,080
internationally as i can see now it is

570
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,279
good step and good indication that even

571
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,400
you and buddies they try to give a

572
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,279
bigger room or more room for the ngos

573
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,520
they are involving vietnam as an

574
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,000
advisory board they are giving them more

575
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,440
in their campaigns which is good

576
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,440
indications and uh we watch event that

577
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,039
will be extended to the human right

578
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:23,200
council which is unfortunately here the

579
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,799
human rights council is representing the

580
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:26,720
states which we believe that the

581
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,520
consultative status of the ngos should

582
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,919
be easier than it is and more role of

583
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,279
the ngos

584
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,799
as much as we can we have to engage ngos

585
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:40,240
in all u.n mechanism and we should

586
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,799
demand the states that they should give

587
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:45,360
for the room for the power of the ngos

588
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,760
and any process they do

589
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,600
there's a question here that goes back

590
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,360
to the issue of statelessness which was

591
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,080
at the start of our uh conversation

592
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,679
they're asking could you unpack the

593
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,000
impact of statelessness in the gulf a

594
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,240
bit more they talk about kuwait and also

595
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,640
the fact that qatar has deprived

596
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,279
citizenship of a clan there's also the

597
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,840
uae that has its own stateless

598
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,679
population

599
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,640
comment a little bit about that

600
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,240
unfortunately the issue of the

601
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,080
nationality in the gulf a little bit

602
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,159
sensitive for the states they locate

603
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,799
totally as a sovereignty of the state

604
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,640
and without any type of the uh state of

605
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:27,279
law without any type of the

606
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,720
let me say

607
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:31,279
away from international conventions it

608
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,640
states

609
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:37,679
they feel they have all the full rights

610
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:40,320
either to

611
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,760
refuse the nationality of the people who

612
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,400
already live their centuries back like

613
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,320
we don't in kuwait they have been

614
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,600
deprived

615
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,400
their rights we have

616
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,799
more than 200 thousands

617
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,000
equations are stateless in kuwait

618
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,919
imagine you are living in kuwait your

619
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,320
father your grandfather lived in kuwait

620
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,039
and they are been there so so long time

621
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,760
centuries back but you don't have any

622
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:10,400
basic right of as a citizenship as

623
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,640
being kuwaitis you've been deprived of

624
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,720
your basic services by the government

625
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
and so on you don't have official

626
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,640
documents you cannot travel you cannot

627
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,080
have education you're going to have

628
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,840
birth certificate you cannot get

629
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,960
marriage

630
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,679
so so easily as i said it's totally like

631
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,000
a social death or in another time

632
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:29,760
whenever there's a political dispute

633
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,279
your nationality will be revoked and

634
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,600
you'll be expect out of country this is

635
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,880
so clear now in the kuwait as a bedouin

636
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,400
and now we could see

637
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,559
it's happened in bahrain

638
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,559
by revoking nationality and

639
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:46,320
unfortunately in qatar when some tribe

640
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,279
they're being banned of their basic uh

641
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:52,320
qatari citizenship

642
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,760
joad faires we have time for um just a

643
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,159
final remarks do you have any final

644
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:02,240
thoughts um before we wrap up

645
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:05,440
i encourage all the activists once again

646
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,000
sorry my throat yeah have a drink of

647
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,559
water i'll have a drink of water as well

648
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,279
yeah thank you

649
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,480
i think uh with the digital sphere and

650
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,960
shrinking and then the distance among us

651
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
as activists and as a ngos

652
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:26,960
and and all those who are demanding the

653
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,960
change in this planet

654
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,399
uh we have to engage ourselves with all

655
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,960
international

656
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:37,440
events related to the

657
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,360
human rights democratic change and so on

658
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,000
and once again i emphasize a lot that we

659
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,360
have to

660
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,120
depends on the

661
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,399
civil civil movement and away

662
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,520
from any type of their violence and we

663
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,520
have to be

664
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,520
managing all our

665
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,360
act on the very peaceful manners

666
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,840
the change is coming we have to be

667
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,120
more patient but active in the same time

668
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,760
we should have clear vision that to

669
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,760
maintain

670
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:15,600
a a peaceful planet through adaptation

671
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,559
of

672
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,480
democratic process and exchange of our

673
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:23,279
all experience toward

674
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,240
further establishing

675
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,440
a stability and exchanging or our vision

676
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,200
toward sustainable developments and once

677
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,880
again i believe all that cannot be

678
