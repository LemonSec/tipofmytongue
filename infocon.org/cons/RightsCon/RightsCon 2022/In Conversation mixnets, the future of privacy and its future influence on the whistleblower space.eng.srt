1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,240
welcome back to the studio and for the

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,559
next 30 minutes we're in conversation

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,679
with chelsea manning and harry halpen

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,759
welcome to the program hello to you both

5
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,039
uh chelsea manning needs no introduction

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,279
but i will do my best to provide a brief

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:22,560
introduction

8
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,960
she is a network security and artificial

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,519
intelligence expert and also one of her

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,080
most well known whistleblowers on the

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,599
face of the planet

12
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,200
she served seven

13
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
years in military prison before

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
president barack obama commuted her

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,320
sentence and she was released in 2017

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,040
now among many other things she is an

17
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,320
advisor at nymtech which is where harry

18
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
halpen is from he is the co-founder and

19
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,879
ceo so both of you are connected

20
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:55,440
to nymtech so uh

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,879
we don't want to talk too much about the

22
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,199
company uh we discussed this beforehand

23
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:01,840
um and harry why don't we start though

24
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,920
so you can quickly tell us what you and

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,720
chelsea are trying to do uh via nymtech

26
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
and and of course um there's been some

27
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,960
criticism uh about the fact that it's a

28
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:14,560
token based id platform and and and so

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:15,840
on uh

30
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,080
over to you harry

31
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,600
yeah

32
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,400
we're a um effectively a

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,799
privacy project we're not an identity

34
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,920
project and our goal is to make a system

35
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,600
which effectively

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,200
can prevent what's called mass

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,600
surveillance so mass surveillance is

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,479
when governments can watch all the

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,159
inputs and outputs of a network and

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
determine when someone is talking to

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,520
someone else

42
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,079
hello harry

43
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,840
oh yeah yeah sorry i was just that's

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,600
what we were doing so we were originally

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,439
funded by the

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,439
european commission

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,840
and essentially because the threat model

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,479
of a vpn or tour does not really make

49
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,840
much sense

50
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,439
uh when you are dealing with

51
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,280
nation-state level adversaries such as

52
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,439
the nsa or even for example the chinese

53
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,479
government

54
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,760
or uh at this point almost anyone and uh

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,239
furthermore we did pursue the path with

56
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,319
the approval of the european commission

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,160
the path of working on cryptocurrency

58
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,599
technologies

59
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,440
uh because to be honest we didn't want

60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,120
to be dependent on u.s government

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,280
funding we didn't want to be dependent

62
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,680
on a lot of other venture capital based

63
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,840
funding so we took tokenized funding

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,519
because that's the easiest

65
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,840
funding to take and we are kind of

66
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,840
against putting identity systems on the

67
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,599
blockchain in general

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,000
um we are instead we provide privacy so

69
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
people can selectively reveal their

70
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,280
identity thanks

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
great thank you so much for explaining

72
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,080
what the company does um so i think you

73
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
know one thing you mentioned and before

74
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,760
we go in and dive in i just want to

75
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,680
remind everyone please throw in your

76
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,920
questions we're going to i anticipate a

77
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,519
lot of questions so we're going to try

78
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,840
to get through as many as possible but

79
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,920
the earlier you submit your questions uh

80
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,760
the most likely we'll be able to get to

81
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,360
them and so um you talk about

82
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,280
decentralization um and also mentioned

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,840
tour chelsea could you talk about this

84
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,120
um

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,200
signal tour these are centralized

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
systems um what you're working on with

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
uh harry is decentralized oh why

88
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,280
so one of the issues with uh sent with

89
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,280
centralization is that um whenever you

90
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,159
have centralized servers that hold keys

91
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,640
or that transfer information or you know

92
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,959
what nodes are on a peer-to-peer network

93
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,200
one of the problems is that uh

94
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,879
if there's it becomes a single point of

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,840
failure so if that if you are able to

96
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
target and take down that node or that

97
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
series of nodes uh on the network uh

98
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,200
either

99
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,400
legally

100
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,599
uh you know through a ddos attack or uh

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,920
by cutting off ip addresses or anything

102
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,680
like that uh one of the problems that

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,840
you have with decentralized networks is

104
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,319
that um you're able to essentially you

105
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,319
know either compromise the network or

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,720
prevent uh the transfer of packets from

107
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,120
continuing to occur across the network

108
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
uh but you know i imagine that signal is

109
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:11,680
probably one of the most widely used if

110
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,519
not the most widely used app for a lot

111
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
of people at wright's con who think that

112
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,160
the security is is is good um has there

113
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,680
been cases where

114
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,479
this uh weakness that you point out this

115
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,800
single point of failure has manifested

116
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,960
either via signal or tor or other

117
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:29,199
applications like them

118
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,720
sure there's been a number of instances

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,720
that not necessarily with signal but uh

120
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:35,600
certainly with uh certain vpn services

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:37,120
and uh with it with a number of

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,600
different uh you know like uh i mean

123
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,840
even tour itself has you know had had

124
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:43,759
issues uh and that and there's a

125
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,800
constant uh battle with no with sort of

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,960
nodes and some in some hostile states

127
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,720
like you know i'm thinking of china in

128
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
particular uh and and

129
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,960
obviously some uh some

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,120
you know some of these uh like

131
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,759
uh app based uh encrypt encrypted

132
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,320
messaging services um they they are

133
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,720
prone to uh receiving subpoenas or

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,400
having to be in compliance with certain

135
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,160
government agencies depending on the

136
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,680
jurisdiction that they're operating out

137
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,919
of um and you know this this has

138
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,759
happened in the past and obviously

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:14,960
there's been

140
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,080
more

141
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
specific cases in which this has

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,600
happened where it's been like oh this is

143
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,960
supposed to compromise six people as

144
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,479
opposed to the entire network but

145
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,759
certainly uh this happened with

146
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,520
telecommunication uh

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,520
telecommunications before encryption and

148
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,720
so we're just you know you're just

149
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,919
trying to prevent this from sort of

150
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
happening with encrypted things as it

151
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,720
becomes more and more of the

152
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,520
infrastructure backbone of society so

153
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,840
tell us a little bit more about

154
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,440
decentralization than the advantages and

155
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,840
what makes it a potentially better way

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,000
of dealing with privacy

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,199
so one of the advantages to

158
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:47,919
decentralization is that you essentially

159
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
don't have uh you don't have the single

160
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
point of failure so uh consensus-based

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,840
networks uh you know

162
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,840
they they tend to be blockchain based or

163
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,160
whatever um but these decentralized

164
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:02,720
networks uh sort of have a governance

165
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
model that's more

166
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:08,400
that's more horizontal where it's more

167
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,400
based on sort of a an actual

168
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,280
peer-to-peer uh consensus-based module

169
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,600
uh uh you know

170
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,319
system and so you don't have as many

171
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,000
you don't have as many issues you don't

172
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
have as many situations where uh these

173
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,199
these things are going to crop up as

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
issues or as failures across the network

175
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,680
how receptive has the privacy community

176
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,120
been um

177
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:33,759
looking at decentralization networks as

178
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,479
um a possibility i mean

179
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,400
i ask this because there's just a lot of

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
skepticism uh these days about

181
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,280
blockchain and so on

182
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,199
right uh and i'm i'm one of those

183
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,600
skeptics uh which is i think of uh where

184
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,880
i'm placed in sort of an awkward

185
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,039
position is that generally uh i think

186
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,599
the block block-based blockchain-based

187
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:55,919
uh infrastructure is sort of a problem

188
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
uh there's there's a number of different

189
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
cultural problems with uh within the

190
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,240
blockchain space especially

191
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,720
cryptocurrency space i'm very skeptical

192
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,880
of cryptocurrency uh and sort of the the

193
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,680
community and the the the the uh

194
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,880
inherent uh wealth base uh you know sort

195
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,560
of wealth and and asset uh you know uh

196
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,960
accumulation based model uh sort of you

197
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,000
know like

198
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,840
almo almost cap like uh just a

199
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,919
replication of recreation the capitalist

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,080
infrastructure of you know the amount of

201
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,039
the fiat monetary system um so but

202
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,960
separate apart from that uh the privacy

203
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,400
community has always wanted

204
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,160
decentralization has been trying to move

205
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,479
towards decentralization that's what tor

206
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:38,160
is uh uh set out to do but uh one of the

207
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,759
problems with with these decentralized

208
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,440
models is sort of incentivizing people

209
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,520
to you know participate in the network

210
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,479
and to be

211
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,639
uh you know this stuff works on a

212
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,560
smaller scale it could be decentralized

213
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,000
a smaller scale we've seen this uh in

214
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,840
2019 with the protest movements in hong

215
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,840
kong where uh you know sort of

216
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,879
decentralized uh privacy-based

217
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:00,800
encrypted networks were able to be set

218
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
up on the ground uh but it you know the

219
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,280
the maintenance of that and the the the

220
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,039
consistency of that and to make sure

221
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,440
that that kind of thing is can be scaled

222
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,000
up has been a significant problem and i

223
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,960
think that one of the that one of the uh

224
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,759
the

225
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,960
innovations of this sort of nim model is

226
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,520
is to sort of uh

227
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,599
experiment with uh with a with an

228
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
incentive with the incentivization

229
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
structure in order to ensure that there

230
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
are the uh the cert there's a certain

231
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,159
threshold nodes across the network to

232
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,760
ensure that the actual security of the

233
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,839
network yeah and and i'll just want to

234
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,919
add through this just a little bit a

235
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,839
little bit

236
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,719
straightforward um you know a lot of

237
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,839
people so uh i was just in beirut last

238
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:45,600
week for a nem hackathon and we're gonna

239
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,800
do our next hackathon like the ukraine a

240
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,440
lot of people in the global south or in

241
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,880
eastern europe

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,320
uh have to be honest uh you know

243
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,240
economic issues

244
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:00,800
um and they they do need funding and

245
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,880
they don't have the resources or the

246
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,360
connections to write government grant

247
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,080
proposals um i know rights contacts have

248
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,440
done a wonderful job reaching out to

249
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,720
these communities

250
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,800
uh but you know you do want the ability

251
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
for people in uh the countries that are

252
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,720
actually having some of the the problems

253
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,160
that the software is trying to address

254
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,519
in terms of rounds to be able to use the

255
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,760
software run the nodes themselves

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,959
and

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,120
this requires some economic incentives

258
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,920
volunteer uh the bet that nim is making

259
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,839
is that volunteer altruistic models

260
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
where the people that run the nodes in a

261
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:36,080
privacy network uh have to essentially

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,880
volunteer the hardware uh cost do not

263
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,519
probably scale so our community uh in

264
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,600
terms of at least telegram numbers has a

265
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
large amount of chinese involvement

266
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,040
ukrainian involvement russian

267
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,279
involvement vietnamese involvement

268
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,640
turkish involvement it's a very

269
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,600
different

270
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
uh kind of composition uh than what

271
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,519
we've seen elsewhere now a lot of those

272
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,279
people probably out there just to make

273
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
money running a node and you know we may

274
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:00,959
not agree

275
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,040
with that i i personally run a tour note

276
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,120
i use signal i use tor i think there's

277
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,680
wonderful technologies however that

278
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,519
being said i also think that it's

279
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
completely valid for someone to

280
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,680
participate in privacy network in order

281
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,360
to make some money

282
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,880
so that they can and it's better that

283
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
they contribute to a privacy network

284
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,959
that helps people uh defend human rights

285
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
and fight surveillance uh than another

286
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,279
kind of network uh for example some sort

287
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,720
of degenerate gambling network and

288
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,360
this is this is a very different model

289
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,440
than i think the volunteer state funded

290
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:36,000
model that we're used to in privacy

291
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
enhancing technologies but i do think

292
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,760
it's something that privacy enhancing

293
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,360
technologies people were looking at in

294
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,160
the 90s and yeah there are a lot of

295
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,440
problems with web3 there's a lot of

296
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,360
scams there's all ponzi schemes i'm

297
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,640
personally very happy to see some of

298
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,160
them collapse

299
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,519
that being said i do think it's

300
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,600
important to look at sustainable

301
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,839
economic models uh which aren't

302
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,040
dependent

303
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,839
on no matter how wonderful the the grant

304
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,079
giving body is or how terrible that

305
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,399
aren't dependent on external

306
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,160
funding sources and become

307
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,000
self-sustainable i think that's a model

308
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
that has a lot of appeal uh throughout

309
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,360
the world and so we're just kind of

310
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,880
giving a shot now it may not work we're

311
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,959
not sure yet but we'll see

312
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,120
i mean i think it goes to the heart of

313
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,800
one of the issues which is that privacy

314
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,959
is a human right but it tends too often

315
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,760
to become uh privacy is a privilege for

316
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,600
those who can afford it right on a very

317
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,079
basic level for people who are tuning in

318
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,560
who might not be able to um who aren't

319
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,480
who don't know too much about web3 we

320
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,079
can go uh

321
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,000
to something simpler i don't know if

322
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,760
this is a good analogy but i think of

323
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,839
the android phone versus the iphone

324
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,519
right you pay that premium for the

325
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,079
iphone and to have the better security

326
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,560
at least that's how apple uh likes to

327
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,120
sort of uh market it so can you talk a

328
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:51,200
little bit about uh

329
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
the direction you're headed and what are

330
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,360
the vulnerabilities uh and the

331
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,440
weaknesses of that you touch on the need

332
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,160
for for the economic incentive but other

333
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:02,519
other challenges um that i think

334
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:05,920
decentralization faces

335
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,000
sure uh one of the one of the biggest

336
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,440
challenges in my opinion of

337
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,920
decentralization is ensuring that uh

338
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,240
that you don't have uh and this is what

339
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,839
harry was sort of alluding to is that

340
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:17,839
you don't have uh

341
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,720
the network be uh sort of because it

342
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,399
because there's nobody managing the

343
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,959
network at like a 50 000 foot view you

344
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:26,959
know a sort of top down approach to

345
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,160
these things uh one of the things that

346
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,279
we've seen with with attempt to

347
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,360
decentralize networks is that they they

348
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,120
is that they become heavily concentrated

349
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,120
in certain regions where there are

350
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
regions there are some regions that

351
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,399
benefit better than others

352
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,040
you know in terms of uh in terms of the

353
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
distribution so you want to make sure

354
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,240
that the that the network is as

355
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,880
distributed evenly as possible across

356
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,959
the whole thing and there's no real way

357
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,680
to ensure that um you know because there

358
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,040
isn't uh there is a you know with a

359
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,720
consensus-based infrastructure you're

360
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,560
not having that sort of like okay we're

361
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,160
gonna put servers here here here and

362
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,120
here you are really dependent upon the

363
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,000
sort of organic nature of of the of the

364
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,800
network itself um and i think that

365
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,760
uh

366
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,800
one of the things that i have an

367
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,120
interest in doing in doing with with nem

368
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,680
in particular is is sort of having a

369
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,920
hardware and infrastructure approach

370
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,120
and trying to ensure that uh out in uh

371
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,360
hot regions that are hostile to sort of

372
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,079
having a large server farm for instance

373
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,680
you want to be able to use a small

374
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,680
mobile device or or something like that

375
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,600
to be able to run these nodes and for

376
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,399
the average user uh that that uses the

377
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,560
uses a tool like this they're not gonna

378
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,839
have to deal with any of the

379
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,360
infrastructure stuff all of this stuff

380
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,360
is at an infrastructure layer the the

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,160
person who's running an app the whatever

382
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,320
quote unquote killer signal like app

383
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,920
that you just download on your on your

384
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,600
on your mobile device is just gonna work

385
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,199
and you're not gonna have to fuss around

386
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,800
with you know understanding anything

387
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,880
about any of this stuff it'll just work

388
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
great now this conversation is about the

389
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
future of privacy and so i wanted to

390
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,680
throw out um other considerations about

391
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,519
um

392
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,079
uh concepts related to privacy that most

393
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,079
people don't necessarily consider

394
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,920
chelsea i know that you care a lot about

395
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,240
uh considering privacy as a health issue

396
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,399
could you talk a little bit about that

397
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
sure uh you know from my own experience

398
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,560
in prison and being uh held in both

399
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,320
just over a year of solitary confinement

400
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
and then another uh you know six or

401
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,320
seven years of being out in um general

402
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,839
population where i'm actually

403
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,839
interacting with other prisoners

404
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,880
i view privacy uh and lack thereof of

405
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,720
privacy is sort of a health issue

406
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,040
because when you're being observed or

407
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,120
you you know that you are at risk of

408
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,600
being observed at any given time in in a

409
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,880
certain space

410
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
that could be very exhausting and

411
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,399
alienating uh especially if you don't

412
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,720
know who's doing the observing so one of

413
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
the things that i've noticed with with

414
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,639
sort of the transition from uh i i

415
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
remember i i remember i recall that i uh

416
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:56,639
something like nine percent of people

417
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:58,959
were quote unquote not extremely online

418
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,680
uh and that number is bumped up uh or

419
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,480
extremely online in 2019 and that number

420
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,800
bumped up to i think close to 30 percent

421
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
by uh by 20 by the end of 2021 mostly

422
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,440
due to the transition of things over

423
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,920
over uh to virtual because of the

424
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:15,760
pandemic right uh and and the

425
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,680
restriction methods that were in place

426
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,480
because of that um uh so one of the

427
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:21,519
things that we've seen from a health

428
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:23,920
perspective is that it's just it's just

429
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,560
not knowing and being alienated via via

430
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,600
this sort of

431
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,519
method is i think having a significant

432
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,440
health impact on people i i think it is

433
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,880
making people more tired it's making

434
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,800
people more exhausted it's making people

435
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,800
feel like they don't have because it

436
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:37,920
used to be that when you worked a

437
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,600
nine-to-five job you would go home at

438
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,800
the at the night and you wouldn't have

439
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,639
to worry about work anymore now you're

440
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,040
connected 24 7 and and it's it's like

441
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,959
impacting your sleep patterns and you

442
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:49,519
know and your ability to to concentrate

443
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,360
you know on your day to day tasks or

444
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
going out shopping or whatever like our

445
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,800
lives are being integrated in this

446
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,360
really uncomfortable virtual space and i

447
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,880
think that i think that the lack of

448
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,720
privacy uh

449
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,000
and protections in that air in that

450
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,040
realm and one of the things that i'm

451
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,800
advocating for is is like

452
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,279
it is mandated sort of time periods

453
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,199
where you you're where companies can't

454
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,800
call your email you for a certain period

455
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:13,120
of time well i think that that happens

456
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,560
in certain countries in europe right

457
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,240
here you're not allowed to send emails

458
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,040
or

459
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,720
or anything after a certain hour there's

460
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,800
no expectation i think france actually

461
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,639
made a law or something don't quote me

462
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,320
on that but i i'm absolutely certain

463
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,320
this one country in europe has done that

464
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,440
and i think it's

465
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,079
france has friends has okay great um

466
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:31,680
thank you so much harry i think we're

467
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,839
going to go to questions right now i

468
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,519
wanted to start questions early because

469
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,279
i know that at least

470
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,279
200 people signed up or something like

471
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:42,160
that and there's lots of questions um so

472
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,800
the first one is from

473
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,079
domingo

474
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,600
and

475
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,920
he is asking that the nim white paper's

476
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,240
disclaimer states that nim tokens are

477
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
not to be traded as securities in the

478
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,839
u.s such as to not violate the 1933

479
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,800
securities act however on your blog it

480
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,279
states that token holders can earn an ap

481
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,480
why of up to 45

482
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,799
in annualized returns about three to

483
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,359
four percent each month um and he's

484
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,079
saying this can't fit the definition of

485
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
an investment and may bring regulatory

486
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,799
problems how can nemtek address this

487
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:23,359
contradiction i think this one is for

488
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:24,640
you harry

489
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,720
yeah so uh i used to work at mit i took

490
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,160
you know classes that gary ginsler is

491
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:33,360
now head of sec and uh there's a reason

492
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,160
nem is not a company uh based in united

493
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,480
states we are based in switzerland

494
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,440
uh where cryptocurrencies have a very

495
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,240
clear regulatory framework we have filed

496
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,720
a prospectus that has been verified

497
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,960
by the first prospectus authorities

498
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,280
particularly bx and six

499
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,200
and we have registration with finma

500
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,520
which is the swiss financial authority

501
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,200
and we're currently working to register

502
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,960
with other authorities

503
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,760
because the u.s rules around this kind

504
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,760
of technology is unclear in terms of how

505
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,559
to register it uh we are not registering

506
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,799
currently in the united states until

507
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:11,440
those rules are clear so we purposefully

508
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,080
exclude node runners in the u.s um and

509
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,760
that's interesting because you know most

510
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,919
other privacy projects have a lot of

511
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,840
node runners in the us and by excluding

512
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,760
us we've actually let people from other

513
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,440
countries kind of step up so i think

514
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,400
overall it's a good thing yes you can

515
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,840
get more nim

516
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,480
if you run a mix node that's the whole

517
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,280
point

518
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,960
um the whole point is to give someone

519
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,120
privacy but the mix number of name you

520
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:38,160
have is a kind of a reputation

521
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,640
it states how effectively you're mixing

522
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,559
tokens and provisioning privacy to other

523
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,440
people

524
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,160
currently because there's very few a lot

525
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,760
less than we wanted i think there's

526
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:51,120
about 500 mixed nodes uh provisioning

527
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,919
privacy we have uh we kind of increase

528
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:56,640
people's reputation rapidly that will

529
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
slow down as the system matures so i

530
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,960
hope that answers the question i do

531
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,080
apologize for any people that want to

532
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
run nodes in the u.s you will just have

533
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,559
to wait okay so here's another follow-up

534
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,720
question uh it's quite long gonna try to

535
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,280
summarize it and hopefully get it right

536
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,080
but the talking about the reward system

537
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,720
for nim um seems to reward users that

538
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,320
contribute to infrastructure i think you

539
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,160
just mentioned that it's centralized in

540
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,640
that a very small number of participants

541
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,559
control over 90 of the network this is

542
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,559
something that we uh see with a lot of

543
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,400
other blockchain um

544
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,799
uh i don't know what the proper word is

545
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,559
blockchain

546
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,960
platforms um

547
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,919
and so i guess the concern is

548
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,919
that early

549
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,760
early users are the big beneficiaries

550
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
um and that

551
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,240
sorry i'm just going through

552
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,160
so with no ways to validate that these

553
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
groups are under the okay so yeah um

554
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,280
if such an entity wish to censor the nim

555
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,919
network so they're wondering about

556
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,520
um

557
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,760
i i i think i i see that you've got it

558
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:04,880
okay quickly okay so i think the the

559
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,640
question is stating how is it that we

560
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,280
can prevent the nsa or another you know

561
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,280
evil from co-opting

562
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,440
let's say putin from just buying a

563
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679
gazillion nodes with all his infinite

564
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,480
money or their infinite money and just

565
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,320
co-opting a network so i think there's

566
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,640
there's two aspects of this question so

567
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,600
one is that mixnet works because each

568
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,080
unlike poor vpn each packet is routed

569
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,720
independently so to compromise a single

570
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,720
packet you have to control 80 of the

571
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,080
nodes and to compromise the stream of

572
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,520
packets you have to

573
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,760
you have to get a bunch more so it's it

574
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,440
is harder i just want to say the

575
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,919
baseline to compromise a mixed network

576
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,159
is harder uh than most than like say

577
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,840
bitcoin now that being said there is a

578
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,840
danger that someone tries to run a lot a

579
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
lot of nodes so we have two ways of

580
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,600
dealing with it one is actually in that

581
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
paper it's in section six it's a little

582
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,520
bit hard to read there's a new version

583
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,280
coming out part of the mit crypto

584
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,919
economic systems journal i think later

585
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,559
this week uh but essentially what we

586
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,240
have is we have what we call saturation

587
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,120
points so if a certain there's certain

588
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,120
people there's two ways to combat this

589
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
this a sybil attack you could say

590
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:16,240
one one is we do force them to work so

591
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,000
if a pewter essay are doing a lot of

592
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,520
work the writing law knows it's not

593
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
necessarily bad as long as they're not

594
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,440
running enough to compromise the network

595
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,640
how do you make sure they're not running

596
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,559
enough to compromise the network first

597
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,200
you make it economically irrational to

598
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,280
basically we do delegate staking like

599
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,760
voting on the reputation of nodes so you

600
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,360
know maybe the putin essay are very

601
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,400
popular

602
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,600
but

603
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,080
the pattern of how people would vote

604
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,760
let's say i run a million nodes and we

605
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
all vote for ourselves

606
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,960
uh that's very easy to detect it's easy

607
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,720
to detect that that's corrupt and

608
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,960
because it doesn't follow an organic

609
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,039
kind of power law or which is

610
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,400
unfortunately called rich get richer

611
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,840
because that is indeed the phenomenon

612
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,400
uh a way to kind of distribute the nodes

613
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
among actors so essentially we use

614
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
social network analysis and this kind of

615
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,679
reputation voting mechanism to defeat

616
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:09,280
these kinds of attacks and these are

617
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,480
kind of significant um of the

618
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,720
innovations that go beyond what let's

619
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,640
say bitcoin does and i do agree bitcoin

620
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,640
is bitcoin is heavily centralized i do

621
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,320
agree it's imperfect it's just

622
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,840
interesting because it's one of the few

623
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
decentralized systems uh where

624
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:25,600
incentives work we've had a lot of

625
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,520
previous experiments in decentralized

626
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,679
systems where we while they haven't been

627
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,400
compromised per se in an obvious manner

628
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,600
they have for example they were

629
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,880
compromised they were a couple right

630
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,720
by design yeah

631
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,080
they were designed to be they were

632
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
designed to benefit the people who

633
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,600
founded it and created it

634
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,120
yeah we're trying to build a very

635
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,640
different design we're trying to ensure

636
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,799
some level decentralization and also let

637
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:50,960
the community kind of vote for who they

638
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,799
like and they kind of use statistics to

639
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,799
determine if those people are likely

640
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,559
adversaries or not that's not perfect

641
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,960
but then nothing is got it uh the short

642
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
the short plain ver the the short plain

643
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
english version of of all that is uh

644
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,280
there are technical is that there are

645
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,520
technical limitations built into the

646
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,159
system that actually mean that uh those

647
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,039
kinds of act those kinds of actors can't

648
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,280
can't either can't do that or they will

649
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,440
actually make the the network stronger

650
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:19,360
by participating in the network

651
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,600
excellent well thank you so much next

652
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
question is um

653
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,120
i don't know who it's from but they're

654
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,600
asking does tor

655
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,760
not have a lot of similar protection

656
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,480
mechanisms like node reputation or

657
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,320
detecting corrupt

658
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,080
nodes i don't know if it's node

659
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,600
repetition that's what they mean how

660
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:39,600
would you describe the security

661
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
advantage of your system over tor

662
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,159
so this is this is one of my this is one

663
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
of the reasons why i wanted to

664
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:49,520
invest in a mixnet in general in 2016 i

665
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,320
made the i made a separate proposal uh

666
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,799
very similar to nim uh that didn't have

667
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,600
the incentivization structure that uh or

668
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,120
you know the node incentivization

669
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,200
structure that nem the nim has but i

670
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:03,120
want but i wanted to mix that structure

671
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
that was virtually identical to this

672
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,279
apart from in every other respect and

673
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,400
that was

674
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,880
mostly because of the fact that tor has

675
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,200
identified that this is a problem

676
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
tor nodes there are malicious tour nodes

677
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,400
there are networks that uh trust that

678
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,799
that tag and pipe uh tour traffic

679
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,960
through routes in which they can monitor

680
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
this is an ongoing thing it has been a

681
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,240
it has been a it has been a constant uh

682
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,440
arms race between uh tour developers the

683
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,320
people who run uh good nodes and people

684
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,720
who use the network uh you know

685
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,840
as regular clients um versus these

686
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,320
malicious actors who are running bad

687
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,960
nodes they are piping uh they're piping

688
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,480
and monitoring and sniffing uh the

689
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,480
network they're running they're like

690
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,720
running dummy packets across the network

691
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,919
you know to be able to trace these

692
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,320
things there's a lot going on with with

693
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,520
tor that that mixnet specifically is

694
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,480
designed to address and uh and just the

695
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,919
mixnet portion because one of the things

696
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,360
i think is is going on here is that

697
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,039
there is that there are two major

698
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,279
components to nim uh and this is a bit

699
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,840
of a step back uh to the to the entire

700
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,080
uh discussion here is that there's the

701
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,799
nim there there's the node network and

702
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,960
the incentivization structure which is

703
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:20,799
the the blockchain portion and then

704
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,279
there's the mixnet right and the mixnet

705
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,600
portion is what is is what i'm talking

706
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,760
about here that is that is the the

707
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
packets being transferred across the

708
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
network and and that is that is a that

709
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,120
is a step up that is a that is an

710
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,760
innovation too and that is um it doesn't

711
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,039
mean there's anything necessarily wrong

712
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,640
with what four was trying to do it's

713
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,799
just that this is technically more con

714
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,520
this is technically uh better from like

715
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,360
a from from uh from a security

716
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:48,880
perspective and a privacy perspective

717
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
and an anonymization perspective than

718
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:52,880
than the tord network because it's it's

719
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,440
an upgrade too okay can i can i add just

720
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,600
one little thing yes which is first

721
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,120
thing is that i mean there are inherent

722
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,039
limitations in them it will probably

723
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
always be slower than for i wouldn't

724
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,799
recommend human rights activists use the

725
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:06,080
next year or two it's still very

726
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,679
experimental software

727
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
and also you know tours designed very

728
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,080
much on purpose

729
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,640
uh the way it was i discussed

730
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,960
intensively the tour uh and moxie as

731
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,400
well who's very against decentralization

732
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,240
for very good reasons in terms of

733
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
quality control right the nem network

734
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
and i think more or less the logic of

735
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,240
tor is that

736
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:29,760
a system which is based on altruism

737
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,400
uh you you cannot put in an adversarial

738
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,880
environment immediately it would change

739
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,559
how the community works i think the

740
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,760
community is one of the strongest bits

741
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,840
of tour again i run a tour relay i use

742
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,360
tour every day i recommend everyone you

743
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,679
store constantly it's a great wonderful

744
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,760
piece of software and defends against

745
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,760
most adversaries and may probably is the

746
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,120
best you're going to get in terms of

747
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,200
defending web browsing mixed nets are

748
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,200
more for things like signal

749
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,279
cryptocurrency message based traffic

750
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,679
just technically got it that being said

751
00:26:57,679 --> 00:26:59,039
we're just doing a bet we're saying well

752
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,640
maybe we can make a economically

753
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,799
sustainable system which can survive in

754
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,400
an adversarial environment this is a

755
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,559
very different bet than poor ah very

756
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:08,559
interesting so it's a bet you don't know

757
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:09,840
um

758
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,240
last question i think or maybe maybe you

759
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:12,960
have

760
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,440
time for two more but sarah asks

761
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,240
can web 3 offer ways for rights

762
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,760
advocates and whistleblowers to

763
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,279
communicate in highly restrictive

764
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,200
countries where civil society is

765
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,640
restricted

766
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,720
i think our conversation has addressed

767
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,720
quite a bit of that but um that's the

768
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,320
goal of them

769
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,559
exactly but what about other

770
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,480
possibilities out there in addition to

771
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
what nim is trying to do um are you

772
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,640
seeing other interesting startups and

773
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,880
organization organizations trying to do

774
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,159
that in what they're well one of the

775
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:45,039
precursors to nim and actually would

776
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,360
work well with nim if it were to

777
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,760
actually work is uh is secure drop you

778
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,279
know that was a that was a network in

779
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,679
order to uh in order to provide

780
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:55,200
journalists with the ability to have

781
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,480
sort of a dropbox of information

782
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:01,200
yeah so

783
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,720
these things are already happening there

784
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,480
are many tools that do this stuff um

785
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,840
that are that are designed to do this

786
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,120
stuff tours

787
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,880
like these are and these are layered

788
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,480
applications so it doesn't necessarily

789
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,600
mean that there's one application that

790
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
you choose over the other sometimes they

791
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,440
stack and i think that um there are a

792
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,600
number of tools that uh would integrate

793
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,000
well uh in in

794
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,679
and provide the assignment the the same

795
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:23,360
kind of uh protections and guarantees

796
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,600
that um that are needed for that kind of

797
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,360
threat threat group the problem is that

798
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
they're not very easy to do and they're

799
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:30,399
not and it's not very easy to learn how

800
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,000
to do these things so we need to make it

801
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,960
as simple and easy and as non-technical

802
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,960
as possible

803
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:37,919
got it

804
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,000
well thank you so much chelsea and harry

805
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
for joining us in the studio and thank

806
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,559
you to the audience for following along

807
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:46,720
we really appreciate it

808
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
we'll see you again soon and as always

809
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:52,439
stay engaged
