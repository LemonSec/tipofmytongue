00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,239
worker labor organizing surveillance and

17
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,039
of course fake tax accountability

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,039
i am speaking to you all today from

19
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,600
brooklyn new york and i'm so honored to

20
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
be facilitating this conversation today

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,039
but before we formally introduce our

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
speakers who

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
really don't need any introduction but

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
i'm going to do it anyway i wanted to

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:02,800
set the stage and

26
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,479
lay out some of the stakes for this

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,040
conversation because i really don't

28
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,880
think it could have come

29
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,640
at a better time

30
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
there are some folks who are calling

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,159
this summer the summer of 2022 the hot

32
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:17,840
anti-trust summer

33
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,320
others are calling it the hot privacy

34
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,720
summer at least here in the us

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,080
um

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,759
i personally don't see why it can't be

37
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:27,759
both and i hope it will

38
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,360
but there are several reasons for that

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,640
there is a suite of serious bills to

40
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,720
rein in big tax monopoly power over

41
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,040
markets that may be coming to a vote on

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,640
the senate floor

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,159
in the united states congress in the

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,640
coming weeks

45
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,280
also uh this week

46
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,520
uh there was introduced a bipartisan

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,159
bicameral privacy bill

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,119
by

49
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,680
uh house and senate leaders and it's

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,960
been announced that there will be a

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,320
hearing for that bill next week as well

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,719
so progress is being made but we know

53
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,280
that the us unfortunately lags behind

54
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,799
other countries and regulating digital

55
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,479
rights and competition

56
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,560
many of us know about some of the

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,038
policies in the european union but also

58
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,120
in other regions particularly in latin

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,959
america where one of our speakers today

60
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:18,239
has been moving work in four decades

61
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:19,680
so we've been

62
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,400
asked by the good folks at rightscon

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,040
here to address this question over the

64
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,360
next 40 minutes or so how can

65
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,360
governments regulate the tech industry

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,560
to protect consumers and their privacy

67
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,720
ensure market competitiveness and hold

68
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,959
companies accountable

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,319
i also

70
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,879
would love to add on a few more layers

71
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:42,959
to our conversation and i invite our

72
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,440
speakers and and all the folks tuning in

73
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,879
to keep this

74
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:48,480
kind of rolling around in the back of

75
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
your minds as well the first question

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,800
i'd like us to keep in mind is how we

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,959
broaden the questions of privacy and

78
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,360
antitrust and look at them in concert

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
with one another

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,519
because the way i see it and i think

81
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,720
i suspect some others here might agree

82
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,120
questions about corporate accountability

83
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,280
and consumer protection

84
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,680
involve not only antitrust but also

85
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,280
privacy surveillance civil rights racial

86
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,120
justice and a number of other areas

87
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
which i hope we'll get to explore

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
together

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
second we're

90
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,159
really lucky to have two experienced

91
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:25,840
leaders in different parts of the world

92
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,159
today so i want to pose the question

93
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:31,120
how can we share knowledge in and across

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,959
our countries and what can we learn from

95
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:34,400
one another

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,480
and lastly how do we think about using

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,360
privacy and antitrust policies and tools

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,480
to proactively advance equity

99
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
building power for our most vulnerable

100
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,840
communities by race class gender

101
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,319
sexuality and otherwise

102
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
so thank you all for being here once

103
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,200

106
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,200

107
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,760
will leave 10 to 15 minutes towards the

108
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,599
end for our speakers to answer some

109
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,519

being here

00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,840
it's a interesting time as i mentioned

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,639
earlier big business and in particular

166
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,800
big tech has been

167
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,840
digging deep into its coffers to attack

168
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,840
potential antitrust regulation and

169
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,160
enforcement here in the us just this

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,919
morning the wall street journal reported

172
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
dollars in advertising against bills

173
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,080
that threaten their dominance

174
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
there also seems to be a perception in

175
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,039
some parts of dc that privacy and

176
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,199
antitrust are somehow at odds with one

177
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,960
another and to work on one would only be

178
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,319
possible at the exclusion of the other

179
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,080
so i thought we could

180
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,960
open this up by setting the record

181
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,360
straight i want to play a

182
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,360
quick fire round of agree or disagree

183
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,039
around common

184
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,120
beliefs or misconceptions around

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,360
antitrust so we can set the record

186
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,759
straight here for once and for all

187
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,720
um

188
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,440
so please i'll put out a number of

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
statements tell me whether you agree or

190
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,840
disagree and why

191
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,720
and just for ease let's start with maria

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,400
pass and then have commissioner

193
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,199
slaughter respond afterwards

194
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,880
so here's the first statement

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,720
competition is at odds with innovation

196
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,360
manifest do you have any uh response to

197
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
that

198
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,960
of course i totally disagree

199
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,199
and precisely is the opposite it's a

200
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,800
false dilemma when you try to to point

201
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,919
it out that regulation can negatively

202
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:40,870
impact um

203
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,160
[Music]

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,199
innovation or antitrust enforcement can

205
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,680
negatively impact innovation because

206
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,240
innovation always has been about how to

207
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,240
create an ecosystem that is really a

208
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,199
light that allows that not

209
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,360
the the usual subject

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,840
are the only ones able to innovate but

211
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,440
keeping the diversity and the

212
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,120
possibility of challenging continuously

213
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,080
the the previous technology

214
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,800
development so precisely what

215
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,280
the the competition enforcement the

216
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,479
anticlass enforcement or the regulation

217
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,160
for for antitrust is looking for is uh

218
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,479
to restore that environment of

219
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,360
innovation that it was a the the

220
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,879
principle of

221
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,960
the the technology

222
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,599
itself but that in the recent time in

223
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,240
the digital environment had been

224
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
being loose

225
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,120
on the hands of the

226
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,240
the few global big tech companies that

227
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,240
increasingly have concentrated the

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,360
ability to innovate through the handling

229
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,399
of a key resources for innovation for

230
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,600
example data and that is where the the

231
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,399
issue connect with the privacy topic

232
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,839
that you were mentioning so i will stop

233
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,519
there for for keeping the flow of the

234
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,200
conversation

235
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,640
thank you commissioner slaughter do you

236
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:02,320
have anything to add to that

237
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,560
sir i think maria paz put it very well

238
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:05,440
but

239
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,760
not only do i disagree that competition

240
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,240
and innovation are at odds i think

241
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,040
competition is necessary for innovation

242
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,560
and the simple way to put that is

243
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,240
monopolists have no incentive to

244
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,360
innovate um they can control a market

245
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,959
statically

246
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,959
and they don't have any incentive to

247
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,120
develop new or better products because

248
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,839
their market power protects their share

249
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,760
what we want is a competitively healthy

250
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:32,240
marketplace where new entrants are

251
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,880
continuously showing up with better

252
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,160
ideas better technology better quality

253
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,160
services

254
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,160
lower prices

255
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:45,120
better working conditions the entire

256
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,800
panoply of

257
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,200
improvements that you don't see absent

258
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,240
meaningful competition

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,720
thank you commissioner slaughter

260
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
you let's have you uh

261
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,800
respond to this next one first then uh

262
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:01,920
what about the statement that

263
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,519
competition policy threatens

264
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:09,279
america's global competitiveness

265
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,440
yeah i think that that's another um

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,720
really

267
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,320
damaging straw man argument um it's it's

268
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
made in two different

269
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,760
they're two different flavors of that

270
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,200
argument that i hear one is um

271
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,200
global efforts to rein in big tech

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,240
companies are just protectionist ways of

273
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
punishing american success

274
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,000
to elevate

275
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,880
uh

276
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,440
foreign competitors um i think that's

277
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,839
pretty demonstrably false i also think

278
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:42,480
companies that choose to participate in

279
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
the global economy

280
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
have to um

281
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,720
take with it the cost of participating

282
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
in the global economy which is being

283
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,000
subject to to uh global rules and if

284
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,920
there are competition problems in other

285
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,160
markets that are addressed by

286
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,399
you know for example the dma then that's

287
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,240
something that companies who choose to

288
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,000
participate in europe get to choose to

289
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,160
subject themselves to uh the more

290
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,680
pernicious version of this argument i

291
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,800
think is the one you're pointing to

292
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,959
which is the national security one this

293
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
argument that if we

294
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,800
improve

295
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,160
platform competition in the us or we

296
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
limit the market power of large platform

297
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,000
incumbents in the us we are necessarily

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,720
empowering foreign adversaries like

299
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
china

300
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,040
you mentioned that i had worked in the

301
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,360
senate before i joined the ftc in

302
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:35,519
addition to competition consumer

303
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,200
protection work i did a lot of national

304
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,079
security work and so i take the issues

305
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,680
of national security

306
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,240
extremely seriously and i think we

307
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
absolutely need to be worried about

308
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,639
companies controlled by nation states

309
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:53,120
that may be bad actors but the remedy

310
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
for that is not monopoly

311
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,360
the remedy for that is vibrant

312
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,240
competition among non-nation state

313
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,519
actors so

314
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,600
if we're concerned about national

315
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
security

316
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,440
our remedy is not a monopolist in the

317
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
u.s supply chain it's vibrant

318
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,760
competition and diversity in the u.s

319
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
supply chain because that is how we

320
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,560
insulate ourselves from attack and while

321
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,560
you know it's not in the technology

322
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,120
space necessarily but we see across the

323
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,800
board where we have supply chain

324
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,760
shortages that

325
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,160
monopoly bottlenecks

326
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,440
really exacerbate security concerns

327
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,519
because when there's a problem with one

328
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,920
we have no fallback and so that is part

329
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,880
of why

330
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,680
healthy competitive markets are actually

331
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,560
really essential for national security

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,320
um not protecting monopolists

333
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,240
thank you commissioner

334
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
you obviously work in a different

335
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,600
geographical region but do you want to

336
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,160
respond to questions about competition

337
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,639
in relation to national security

338
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,839
or

339
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,000
global competitiveness in the region

340
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,480
that you work in in latin america

341
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
sure from from my region there are two

342
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,639
elements that are really relevant to

343
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,320
highlight i believe

344
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
one related with

345
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,040
the

346
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,480
the digital and the technology

347
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,639
sovereignty that is not possible to

348
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,519
really

349
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,920
achieve or explore even when you have

350
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,000
these big tech companies that are

351
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,720
dominating the market globally

352
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,480
so that is

353
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
that is the case for latin america that

354
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,040
many of the companies that we have here

355
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,200
providing services are not from the

356
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,760
region and because of their dominance

357
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,399
there are little chances that local

358
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,320
alternatives can grow

359
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,040
and and be successful so

360
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,279
all the regulation or the antitrust

361
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
enforcement can be very helpful in terms

362
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
of really

363
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,760
provide a fair opportunity for local

364
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
innovation and with that not only local

365
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,959
innovation but also digital sovereignty

366
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,959
for our region and for our countries

367
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,160
because

368
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,399
as you mentioned as commissioner was

369
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,639
also pointed out

370
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,240
technology is

371
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,680
entangled

372
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,959
very intimate with the use for for

373
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,880
surveillance for national security

374
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:13,519
purposes and all the data for example

375
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
that is collected and used for

376
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,399
implementing some of these uh technology

377
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,240
applications that are provided by these

378
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,760
global companies

379
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,760
go out from the hands of the of the

380
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,480
governments or the people that it's in

381
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,199
this side of the world so i think that

382
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,199
there is a very relevant uh

383
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:33,760
element in that sense in in terms of uh

384
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,279
finding a a fairer equilibrium

385
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,000
in the global relationships in terms of

386
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,440
a having opportunity of a balance

387
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,079
in in some way the possibility to access

388
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,079
to control technology and to benefit

389
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,760
back from what technology is being

390
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,440
developed because in many cases for

391
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,760
example all these technologies that are

392
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,560
provided by this global monopolies

393
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:59,839
they are fed feed with the data and the

394
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,680
elements that are provided locally in

395
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,079
other regions of the world but the value

396
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,959
is captured finally by those companies

397
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,560
the monetary value but also the

398
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:11,839
possibility again to use that as an a

399
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:14,720
part of the raw material for for

400
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,839
future innovation so all that

401
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:18,800
needs

402
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,920
of course that regulation take place and

403
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,480
anti-trust informant take place in order

404
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,199
to try to

405
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,560
balance a little bit more the

406
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,040
possibilities of a participation in

407
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,440
these digital markets for local

408
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,240
regional actors

409
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:37,680
thank you

410
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:40,560
this last one i want to zoom in and

411
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,519
spend a little bit more time on

412
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,000
i want to ask both of you how you see

413
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,160
the relationship between antitrust and

414
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,800
privacy we've touched on it but what are

415
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
some examples of of cases that you've

416
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:56,240
seen recently or in history where

417
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:57,759
these two

418
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,720
areas intersect and what can we learn

419
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,199
from those experiences commissioner

420
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,479
sutter let's start with you

421
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,839
so i think this is another area where uh

422
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,240
antitrust and privacy

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,680
can be at odds if they are not done

424
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,920
thoughtfully so for example you could

425
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,120
envision

426
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,040
privacy regulations that would enhance

427
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
the power of large incumbents and allow

428
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,399
them to be the only ones who participate

429
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,399
so build on their market power even

430
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,680
though they're nominally privacy

431
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,880
protective

432
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
that would be bad we don't want that

433
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,839
that is not the only way to be privacy

434
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,759
protective and in fact you could see

435
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:45,120
privacy rules that would facilitate

436
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:46,480
competition

437
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,839
and diminish the ability of large

438
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,160
players to build market power by

439
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:55,839
amassing huge amounts of data on people

440
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,160
across their ecosystem so

441
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,000
i think this is one of those areas where

442
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,880
you have to be thoughtful and careful

443
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,039
the details really matter

444
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
but in fact protecting

445
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,839
personal autonomy personal data and

446
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
the operation of a free and fair

447
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,640
marketplace are absolutely in concert

448
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
with each other

449
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,880
mario past do you have anything to add

450
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,480
to that

451
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
yeah of course i agree with everything

452
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
that a commissioner was pointed out i

453
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,880
will i will add as a recent example of

454
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,559
this and how a

455
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,080
global movement is starting to

456
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
articulate around the intersection

457
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:36,720
between

458
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,520
competition data protection and consumer

459
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,799
protection is the recent case of a

460
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,440
whatsapp change of terms of conditions

461
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,000
and and privacy policy

462
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,039
personally as part of my organization my

463
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,520
organization joined many organizations

464
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,000
around the world that were questioning

465
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,200
this updating of condition that it was

466
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,720
not very uh

467
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,840
deep in terms of what previously uh had

468
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,400
been done by the company in terms of

469
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,320
collection of data but it was an

470
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,039
opportunity to question the the the

471
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
successive changes and and the

472
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,520
increasing amount of data that

473
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,919
was being collected and shared with

474
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:18,880
other

475
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,400
services of the same parent company so

476
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,160
in this case meta

477
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,320
all these are meta companies and and

478
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,559
whatsapp was starting to share or was

479
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,080
already sharing since 2016

480
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,039
data with facebook so i think that the

481
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,919
intervention in many cases

482
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,520
of different authorities around the

483
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,520
world for making question to the company

484
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,160
about this change of uh of terms of

485
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:46,880
service and the privacy policy

486
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,000
pointed out that really uh the the fact

487
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,320
of a of collecting uh

488
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,280
big amounts of data and and being able

489
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:58,000
to cross this data between different

490
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,559
services applications in which the

491
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:01,679
company

492
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,919
have dominance around the world

493
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:05,440
particularly post

494
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
questions that are linked with

495
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:09,760
competition with consumer protection and

496
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,919
with data protection

497
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,440
in many countries in which these

498
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:17,120
questions uh arise and there are already

499
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
in place a strong data protection

500
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,679
laws as the the case of the european

501
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,120
countries that make

502
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,360
this case and and started to questioning

503
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,160
the the the movement of the company uh

504
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,559
in others for example in chile or in

505
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,280
argentina or in brazil

506
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
there are there is data protection

507
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,960
legislation but we perceive that the

508
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
ability of the authorities to intervene

509
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,760
in these cases it was

510
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
limited because of the institutional

511
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:47,200
shortcomings that in many countries

512
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,280
in latin america the institutionality

513
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,039
for antitrust

514
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,039
enforcement has still

515
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,000
but in all those cases what we

516
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,799
see

517
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,240
is that the

518
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,480
institutional cooperation between the

519
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,320
data protection authorities and the

520
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:04,320
competition authorities and the consumer

521
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,720
authorities to evaluate this case in

522
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,960
order to identify what will be the

523
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,520
harmful consequences for the users it

524
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,600
was fundamental so for example in

525
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:16,559
argentina we have a two decisions one

526
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,120
that come came from the

527
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:21,840
consumer authority that it was finding

528
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,559
the company for the changes and also a

529
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,880
resolution i examined

530
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,640
from the competition authority that was

531
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,799
containing these changes and in the case

532
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,799
of brazil for example it was a joint

533
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:35,600
resolution for the consumer authority

534
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
the competition authority and the data

535
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,840
protection authority that pointed out a

536
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,400
number of conditions to a

537
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,480
to the company in order to

538
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:47,919
provide transparency and also limit the

539
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
interchange of data

540
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,159
that it was uh identified

541
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:54,240
so i think that this is very promising

542
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,600
and it's uh proves that the the privacy

543
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,520
protection and the competition or

544
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,919
anti-trust informant can go hang

545
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,679
hand-in-hand and understand with

546
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,440
consumer protection

547
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,360
jane can i jump in just to build on what

548
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,520
maria said there sure because i think

549
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,000
the example she gave highlights exactly

550
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,080
the problem with how we have

551
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,039
historically done privacy in the u.s at

552
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:18,960
least which is sort of through this

553
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,880
notice and consent

554
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,159
privacy policy model um

555
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,320
which is problematic from a privacy

556
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,919
perspective and a competition

557
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,919
perspective and i just want to tease

558
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,520
that out a little bit

559
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,159
noticing consent makes a ton

560
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,360
of sense for a system where notice is

561
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,039
meaningful and and consent is meaningful

562
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:41,919
but

563
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,880
privacy policy terms and services

564
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:45,679
are

565
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,760
almost entirely unintelligible even to

566
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,000
sophisticated attorneys who specialize

567
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,080
in this field right i read them

568
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,080
i don't always understand what they mean

569
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,480
um and if i can't understand them that's

570
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,919
a problem

571
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,000
and then even if i do understand them

572
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,159
and i don't like something that they're

573
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,320
doing

574
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
there are a lot of these services that i

575
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:13,200
need to join to participate in society

576
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:15,679
whether it's for my job or to access

577
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,600
health care or just to find out

578
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,080
information about a local business and i

579
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,840
don't have the opportunity to go to the

580
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,840
company and say well i am comfortable

581
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:26,080
with provision one and two but i'm not

582
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
okay with provision three in your

583
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,919
privacy policy you just have to click

584
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:32,080
accept and move on and you can't vote

585
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:34,720
with your fee because you are already

586
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,520
invested in whatever the platform or the

587
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,799
infrastructure is and so you can't

588
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:43,280
so competition can't provide a

589
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,440
meaningful check on

590
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,120
policies and practices that may be

591
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,360
problematic which is what competition is

592
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,919
supposed to be able to do and so this is

593
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:54,159
an area where

594
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,440
i think you see

595
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,200
really clearly why competition is

596
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,159
important and why more meaningful

597
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,799
substantive limitations on how companies

598
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,039
can collect and use data is important

599
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:07,679
because simply creating a laundry list

600
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:09,039
of mandatory

601
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:11,679
opt-in or opt-out choices

602
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,600
isn't going to provide that meaningful

603
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,400
protection or give people realistic

604
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,720
choice

605
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,039
thank you both for that

606
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:24,320
before i dive into this question which

607
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,600
may be our last topic together just a

608
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,240
quick reminder to folks tuning in

609
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,799
please uh leave any questions you have

610
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:34,720
for commissioner slaughter or maria bass

611
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:37,039
in the chat box and we will get to them

612
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:38,559
shortly

613
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,320
commissioner slaughter you have talked

614
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,559
about how anti-trust

615
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:44,559
can be anti-racist in fact i think

616
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,960
you've said and written that antitrust

617
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,440
should be anti-racist

618
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,840
i want to ask you how you think that

619
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
your work at the ftc can be actively ra

620
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,840
anti-racist in the realm of antitrust

621
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
and if you can get as concrete as

622
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,880
possible about how we can change the

623
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,840
status quo

624
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,559
thanks this is a great question and a

625
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,880
topic about which i am extremely

626
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:12,960
passionate uh

627
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,279
the way i would articulate it

628
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,880
is as follows we have extremely limited

629
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,279
resources as an enforcement agency in

630
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:22,720
fact i was thinking about it when you

631
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,799
mentioned that big tech has spent 36

632
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,360
million dollars just on advertising to

633
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,200
defeat legislation

634
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:32,000
that's 10 of our annual budget for all

635
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,240
of our enforcement work um and it is

636
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,880
like a drop in the bucket for them so

637
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,679
our resources are limited we can't do

638
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:43,760
everything um so the question is of and

639
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,279
there are many many problems competition

640
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,360
consumer protection out there

641
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:52,480
where law enforcement

642
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,640
would be appropriate so the question for

643
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,320
us is how do we deploy our limited

644
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,880
resources how do we set priorities among

645
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
those limited resources and the point

646
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,679
that i have been trying to make is

647
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,880
i think it is better for us to

648
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,360
deploy those resources

649
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,640
to

650
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,279
uh remediate and mitigate harms that

651
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,480
disproportionately affect already

652
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,159
marginalized

653
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:20,880
um communities and

654
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,240
and populations and so

655
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,640
because the choices do that and try to

656
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,520
make our economy and our markets a

657
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,640
little bit

658
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,520
less

659
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,840
inequitable and unequal

660
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,799
or deploy them in ways that reinforce

661
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,720
the structural inequity

662
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:41,600
and inequality that we have so

663
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,400
to be concrete about it

664
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,880
if we're choosing between

665
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,760
um

666
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,520
let's say we have two cases in front of

667
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,200
us and we don't have the resources to

668
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,640
litigate both of them we have to make

669
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,520
hard choices we can't do everything

670
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,679
maybe that means we prioritize the

671
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,279
hospital merger challenge where a

672
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:04,000
community hospital that provides

673
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,039
services to underserved populations is

674
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,520
being eliminated through a merger

675
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,559
over

676
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:11,679
the

677
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,159
merger between large

678
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,120
expensive business services companies

679
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,720
that where the harm is going to fall

680
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,960
disproportionately on already extremely

681
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,120
wealthy businesses

682
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,120
you know i think we have to think not

683
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,640
only about

684
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,840
what the quantification or qualification

685
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,000
of the harm is but who is harmed and how

686
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,919
are they harmed and so how do we do that

687
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,760
in practice means starting with

688
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,080
visibility into the populations that are

689
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,520
affected by the work that we're

690
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
considering and that means not just the

691
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,559
consumers or patients and users of

692
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,360
products but who are the workers at the

693
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,960
companies that we're talking about i

694
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,760
think a really important aspect of this

695
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,200
focus has been

696
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,000
considering the monopsony effect of

697
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,679
concentration on workers in particular

698
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,200
and that has

699
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,000
antitrust angles it also has

700
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,840
there's some consumer protection angles

701
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,000
so for example the the case that we

702
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,720
brought against amazon for misleading

703
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,799
its flex drivers about whether they'd

704
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,880
get to keep their tips um i think that

705
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,720
was an important case

706
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,360
that sounds in this uh entire universe

707
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,279
of focusing our resources on the

708
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:23,679
population who most need the help of the

709
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,039
government rather than the people who

710
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,840
can afford to help themselves better

711
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,720
but you work in a different context for

712
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,880
obviously the structural inequities are

713
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,799
a little bit different but i want to ask

714
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,840
you

715
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,559
a question in the similar spirit which

716
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,799
is how you think about approaching your

717
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,720
work whether an antitrust or privacy

718
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,360
to ensure that you're promoting equity

719
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,840
among the most marginalized among your

720
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,600
communities

721
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:54,480
sure

722
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,399
the first thing that i want to point it

723
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,240
out that maybe is obvious but maybe not

724
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:00,880
so obvious for our current audience

725
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,360
because not everyone is familiar with a

726
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:06,320
anti-trust or competition law and

727
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,360
doctrine is that finally anti-trust or

728
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,559
competition law it's about power

729
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,440
people when when they hear the the the

730
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,080
words they think in economics they they

731
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,440
think in in in in that area that is true

732
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,679
because

733
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,320
power is linked with money but

734
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,960
ultimately what it's about and what uh

735
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,760
why anti-trust regulation was created in

736
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,240
the first place is to control power

737
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,360
and of course power is strictly related

738
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,000
with who holds the power in society and

739
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,320
and who don't and who suffers the

740
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,640
consequences of the the entities that

741
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,640
hold the power and make decision in

742
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,679
their own

743
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,279
interests and not considering the

744
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,679
interest of the marginalized population

745
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:54,480
so in that sense i would say that um

746
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,120
anti-trust enforcement or or competition

747
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,840
regulation in in different regions of

748
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,520
the world and particularly my region in

749
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,799
latin america is relevant because if we

750
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,159
don't do that

751
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,360
finally who get to decide many of the

752
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,760
technological deployment that are being

753
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,720
implemented in our region are these

754
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,360
global dominant companies or are the

755
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,200
governments that are dealing with those

756
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,399
global

757
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:23,120
dominant companies but not always taking

758
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:25,039
into consideration in the in the

759
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,520
developing and in the deployment of the

760
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,919
technology the particular needs and

761
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,840
characteristics of the marginalized

762
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,399
population that as you pointed out in in

763
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,120
your presentation of this question

764
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:39,840
has very different structural challenge

765
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,799
compared to the population

766
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:45,360
the the marginalized population of all

767
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,919
the regions so i think that this is very

768
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,399
relevant in terms of latin america in

769
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,080
which for example we have different

770
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,200
challenges

771
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,200
confronting the inequality

772
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,000
and for for indigenous populations for

773
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,440
women for a beauty community

774
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,440
so there are different components that

775
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,320
have particularities that are very local

776
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,720
and when technology is being designed

777
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,559
and and

778
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,279
in some way enforce it with a logical

779
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,520
that came from from a different place of

780
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,000
the world in this case uh majority of

781
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,240
from the u.s or the global north in

782
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,880
general there are a lot that that get

783
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,720
lost in terms of the the need of

784
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,520
consideration of the of the needs of

785
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,080
this marginalized population in other

786
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,159
places of the world and i think that

787
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,080
anti-trust enforcement and anti-trust

788
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,200
regulation can help to a

789
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,919
point a light in those elements and and

790
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:43,039
and to show how they are a differential

791
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,640
a harmful impact in many cases of this

792
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,559
business model that have been deployed

793
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,240
in in that way in these different

794
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,120
regions of the world

795
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,960
thank you maripas i love the way that

796
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,120
you articulated that about

797
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,000
how antitrust is ultimately about power

798
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
and i think i'll definitely carry that

799
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,960
forward

800
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,039
we have a couple questions from the

801
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:08,640
audience here the first that i see is

802
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,519
how can murder merger regulation

803
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:13,919
influence the concentration of power in

804
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:16,480
digital and hardware platforms

805
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,440
commissioner slaughter do you want to

806
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,000
take that one first

807
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,880
sure absolutely so i think um

808
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,279
one of the real issues that we have in

809
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,679
digital markets is that platforms have

810
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,120
accrued

811
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,600
huge market power sometimes through

812
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,720
merger

813
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,480
sometimes not through merger um

814
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,320
but their mergers have very rarely gone

815
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:42,640
challenged um they have uh

816
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,640
largely because it's sort of a different

817
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,200
model than we had been used to

818
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
been looked at as not eliminating direct

819
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,960
competition and therefore not

820
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,080
problematic but if you look at the ftc's

821
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,240
uh lawsuit against facebook which is

822
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,799
essentially over its acquisitions of

823
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,640
instagram and whatsapp

824
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,320
uh what the

825
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:05,200
what the uh commission alleged there was

826
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,440
that those acquisitions were done to

827
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,519
eliminate the threat of competition and

828
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,720
insulate

829
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,399
facebook's market share in social media

830
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,559
and i think what we are

831
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,480
really committed to is taking a hard

832
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,039
look at understanding the why behind

833
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,519
some of these acquisitions um and how

834
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:25,440
the companies see them

835
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,640
uh as protecting market power and making

836
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,559
sure that we can deploy the tools that

837
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,159
we have to challenge them where

838
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:34,159
appropriate if if what they really will

839
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,159
do is continue to build a competitive

840
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:39,200
moat um a really interesting document

841
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,720
that i would commend to everybody's

842
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,159
attention is the ftc's report last year

843
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,600
on um

844
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,159
acquisitions by the major platforms we

845
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:51,919
put out a report using our 6b authority

846
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,840
documenting the ways in which five major

847
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,470
platforms exercised acquisition

848
00:32:57,470 --> 00:32:58,559
[Music]

849
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,039
practices over the last several years

850
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,559
and it is um fascinating to to think

851
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:06,080
about from that perspective and i think

852
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
one of the value of the reports that we

853
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,120
do in addition to the enforcement we do

854
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,600
is it can help inform public policy

855
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,559
civil society and other thinkers who are

856
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,640
looking at not just individual

857
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:19,440
transactions but broader patterns which

858
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,720
is what i think we really need to be

859
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,720
doing in these markets in particular

860
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,240
mario paz do you have anything to add

861
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,399
about merger regulation

862
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,159
uh influencing the concentration of

863
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,080
power

864
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,039
sure

865
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:35,600
so definitely it's something that is

866
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,919
missing in terms of the enforcement and

867
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:41,039
to look in a more stricter way

868
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:41,840
this

869
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,440
killer acquisition that had been

870
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,480
developed

871
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,919
for years for for the dominant platforms

872
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:50,399
so far so they are good examples of

873
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:52,240
enforcement as the one that was pointed

874
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,320
out by the commissioner there are others

875
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:57,200
in europe but because of

876
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,080
these cases they don't fit well in the

877
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:03,039
traditional doctrine and theory of how a

878
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:04,559
antitrust

879
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:07,120
evaluate the possibility of harm of

880
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,520
these different mergers many of them

881
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
have gone under the rudder and many of

882
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,599
them haven't been covered for example

883
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,760
for the obligation of notify this

884
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,239
operation so we only know about them

885
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,159
because of the of the press or or

886
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
because

887
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,280
they are already implemented and they

888
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,079
are causing some kind of harm in in the

889
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:28,639
market or for the users so the thing is

890
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:30,960
that definitely when one thing that

891
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:33,839
needs to be updated globally even in the

892
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:36,399
more advanced jurisdiction as the us and

893
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,760
and the and and the eu is the doctrines

894
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,480
and the theories of harm that are

895
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:43,839
builded to

896
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:46,000
identify when this

897
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,560
acquisition can be harmful for the

898
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:51,119
competition and for the final user at

899
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:52,079
the end

900
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:54,079
i think that also

901
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,800
in this there is a a very a relevant

902
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,800
characteristic i don't want to get too

903
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,680
technical but you you have to remember

904
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,760
probably everyone have here

905
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,079
at this point that the digital uh

906
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,320
platform in general they benefit from

907
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,480
from network effect

908
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,040
so in general also that means that they

909
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,920
have a natural incentive to cover

910
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,200
a adjacent market so collateral market

911
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,640
and and grow

912
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,480
by killing some

913
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,280
services or by acquiring innovate

914
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,200
innovative companies that maybe they are

915
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,119
not compete exactly in the same service

916
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:30,880
of the dominant platform but they are

917
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,359
very close and they are able to benefit

918
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,000
from this exploitation of a digital

919
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,079
ecosystem uh and this need also that the

920
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,720
the the doctrine and and and and the

921
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,800
jurisprudence regarding for example the

922
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,200
impact of the conglomerate merger

923
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,480
evolves to consider this uh

924
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,520
digital ecosystem as a different figure

925
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,680
when you are analyzing the possibility

926
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,160
of harm in in the acquisition of digital

927
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,040
companies by by dominant uh

928
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,760
big tech companies so i think that

929
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,440
it's a little bit more technical but

930
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:07,119
those are elements that

931
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:08,160
are

932
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,680
they are being reviewed in many

933
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,520
jurisdictions for example i can provide

934
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,079
the case in latin america of chile

935
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,119
recently the the the national prosecutor

936
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:18,960
economic prosecutor updated the

937
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:21,839
guideline for for merger evaluation and

938
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,160
consider some of these elements and

939
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,680
integrate them into the assessment of

940
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:30,320
the future merger in digital markets

941
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,720
because we had already some cases and

942
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,240
they felt short in the evaluation

943
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
because the guidelines were not properly

944
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,200
covering with this element and

945
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:41,920
the the the the guidance for evaluating

946
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,800
the the possible harm in the digital

947
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,160
merger acquisitions

948
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,880
commissioner there's a question here

949
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,960
from the audience about the ftc

950
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,560
settlement with amazon that you

951
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:56,160
described earlier

952
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,359
that i

953
00:36:57,359 --> 00:36:59,520
like uh

954
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:02,640
the question is in the ftc amazon

955
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,480
settlement the company was forced to

956
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:07,440
only pay back driver tips but no other

957
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,079
compensation or action beyond that

958
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,560
if i steal money from someone i will be

959
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,800
punished beyond just giving back what i

960
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,119
stole why wasn't amazon punished

961
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,400
similarly

962
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,640
yeah this is one of the huge problems

963
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,320
with the statutes with which we work

964
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,560
right now um the

965
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:26,640
and in fact

966
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,280
has gotten worse since we put out that

967
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,359
case the

968
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:34,400
law does not give us the authority to

969
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,040
seek punishments monetary punishments

970
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,920
for simply violating the ftc act in

971
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,079
order to get a monetary punishment a

972
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,720
civil penalty we need to have a rule

973
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:47,200
violation um and there wasn't a rule

974
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,640
violation in the amazon case uh for what

975
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,079
it's worth if they had a rule violation

976
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:55,760
that money would go to the federal

977
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:58,079
treasury not to the workers who'd been

978
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:00,960
um hurt i actually think when i say it's

979
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,880
gotten worse what has gotten worse is

980
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,640
that since that decision came down the

981
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
supreme court in amg said not only can

982
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:09,359
we not get civil penalties for

983
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:11,440
first-time law violations we actually

984
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:13,680
can't even discourage ill-gotten gains

985
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,920
and provide restitution to consumers

986
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,000
anymore in federal court

987
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,880
so it is a giant problem congress has

988
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,079
been working

989
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,040
um

990
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,520
to restore that statutory authority and

991
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,599
the house passed a bill although it was

992
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,320
largely along party lines to do that

993
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,240
i think that's important i would like us

994
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,920
to have first-time

995
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,320
civil penalty authority for first-time

996
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,599
offenses because i think you're

997
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:39,520
absolutely right that the deterrent

998
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
effect

999
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,119
of just saying don't do it again give

1000
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:47,359
back what you stole is not enough um so

1001
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:48,960
notwithstanding those statutory

1002
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,960
challenges one of the things we are

1003
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:53,359
thinking really really hard about is how

1004
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:55,520
to effectuate more deterrence from the

1005
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,599
cases that we bring how to really make

1006
00:38:57,599 --> 00:38:59,920
them count and send the message to the

1007
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,320
markets that violating the law is not

1008
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,520
worth whatever

1009
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:05,839
profit you will make off of it

1010
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:07,760
that includes holding individual

1011
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:10,320
executives accountable where appropriate

1012
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,240
making sure that the underlying business

1013
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,839
practices that

1014
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,800
resulted in the um

1015
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,520
the

1016
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
the violation and led to profit for the

1017
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:22,800
company are stopped going forward and

1018
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,960
that they can't profit from them it

1019
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,800
includes things like disgorgement of

1020
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,920
algorithms built off of ill-gotten data

1021
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,839
so we're thinking as creatively as we

1022
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,920
can i have been pushing for a while for

1023
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:34,960
us to do

1024
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,680
a rule making in the data space so that

1025
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:40,079
we can activate more civil penalties

1026
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,680
there too

1027
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,880
but it is it is absolutely a deficit in

1028
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:45,839
the law

1029
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,359
and for what it's worth i don't think

1030
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,520
it's an accidental deficit um the

1031
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:51,359
chamber of commerce has been very

1032
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:53,920
vehemently arguing even against the

1033
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,240
restoral of our restitution authority

1034
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,920
and they would lose their minds over

1035
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,079
civil penalty authority

1036
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,160
because they don't think that companies

1037
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,000
should have to pay when they violate the

1038
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,760
law but i think that they should

1039
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,160
speaking of rulemaking another one for

1040
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:11,920
you commissioner slaughter

1041
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:13,200
what role

1042
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,520
do you see the ftc

1043
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,400
potentially playing via a rule making

1044
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,520
proceeding to protect privacy and civil

1045
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,440
rights online

1046
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,839
yeah this is another area that's a real

1047
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:27,760
passion project for me so first let me

1048
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,240
say this you mentioned that a bipartisan

1049
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,560
bicameral privacy bill came out this

1050
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:34,640
week i think it's a hugely important

1051
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,720
development i think it would be

1052
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:40,000
the best for everybody if the u.s had a

1053
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,480
strong effective

1054
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:44,560
federal privacy law with real

1055
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,119
substantive limitations on how data can

1056
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:48,319
be used

1057
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:50,800
real penalties for violating

1058
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,319
and there are a bunch of great concepts

1059
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:54,319
in the law that was introduced so i am

1060
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:56,800
excited for meaningful federal privacy

1061
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,040
legislation to move forward that said i

1062
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,359
worked in congress for a long time um i

1063
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:03,280
don't think that we should just wait for

1064
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,599
congress to act and until a bill gets

1065
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,000
over the finish line it is still just

1066
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,200
a bill and not a um

1067
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,640
actual statute that we can

1068
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,760
operationalize so for three years now

1069
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,560
i've been saying we should use the

1070
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,040
tools that we have under

1071
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,000
section 18 of the ftc act to open a rule

1072
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,839
making proceeding to address the entire

1073
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:30,960
confluence of issues that arise from

1074
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:34,480
the widespread collection use abuse

1075
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,640
misuse of data

1076
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,800
and i think that it is

1077
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,960
really valuable for us to create this

1078
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,440
public participatory record that can

1079
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,160
help document a lot of the harms in the

1080
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,160
space which are not just what we

1081
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,359
traditionally think of as privacy harms

1082
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:53,119
but also

1083
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,079
bleed into civil rights areas

1084
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,560
i think about discriminatory

1085
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,520
development and use of algorithms

1086
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,319
or even non-algorithmic data

1087
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,560
based discrimination

1088
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,119
i think about the denial of access to

1089
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:11,200
opportunities for things like housing

1090
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,720
and employment

1091
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,440
credit as as areas that

1092
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:17,680
we have a real role to play and i think

1093
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,319
about the way

1094
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:24,079
micro targeted advertising can send

1095
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
different messages to different

1096
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:27,520
communities

1097
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:30,160
in ways that can be discriminatory and

1098
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:32,640
other and pernicious in other ways too

1099
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,560
so i think there's a lot of work to be

1100
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,079
done here and i think we should keep

1101
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,560
plowing ahead uh although i will be very

1102
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:41,599
excited if that good work is interrupted

1103
00:42:41,599 --> 00:42:44,240
by a strong and effective federal

1104
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:47,359
privacy law that brings the u.s more in

1105
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:49,040
line with

1106
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,599
basically all of our counterparts

1107
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:54,240
across across the globe

1108
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:55,599
i'm sure maria

1109
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,599
can personally attest to that um but you

1110
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:01,200
uh mario paz you've been doing a lot of

1111
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:05,119
work recently around uh surveillance in

1112
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:06,560
latin america

1113
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,119
during the kobe 19 pandemic and i wanted

1114
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:11,359
to ask you how you think about

1115
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:12,640
privacy

1116
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,079
surveillance

1117
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,440
and civil rights and liberties

1118
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,079
sure i think that this is very connected

1119
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,760
with a previous answer that i provide

1120
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:23,119
about who

1121
00:43:23,119 --> 00:43:25,200
develop the technology and who provides

1122
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,160
the technology in our region so in many

1123
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,800
cases these surveillance technologies

1124
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,800
that have been deployed again they are

1125
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,280
provided by global

1126
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,599
monopolies that offer their services in

1127
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,560
our region and in many times again

1128
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,640
this this happened

1129
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:45,440
with not enough possibility of control

1130
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,359
of these

1131
00:43:47,359 --> 00:43:50,240
companies in terms of the asymmetry of

1132
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:52,240
knowledge that there is in the region in

1133
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,079
terms of to understand how these

1134
00:43:54,079 --> 00:43:56,319
technologies and the business models are

1135
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,920
deployed

1136
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
a lot of asymmetry in the way in which

1137
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,319
the benefits of that technology are

1138
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:05,280
appropriated finally and and a lot of

1139
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,000
asymmetry in terms of how

1140
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:12,160
strong are our legal frameworks or or or

1141
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:15,040
right protection frameworks to really

1142
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:17,839
enforce an effective protection of

1143
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,319
fundamental rights against the negative

1144
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:22,160
consequences of the deployment of these

1145
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,800
surveillance technologies so there are a

1146
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,520
number of uh of ways in which it it's

1147
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,119
this is very linked

1148
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:32,720
and uh it's particularly again uh

1149
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,520
something that is a

1150
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:37,920
very um harmful for the more

1151
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,200
marginalized communities

1152
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:43,200
the people that it's

1153
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,240
structurally excluded from the society

1154
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:48,560
is the one that is not considered in the

1155
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,480
in the developing of these technologies

1156
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
and they are not considered in the in

1157
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,599
the

1158
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,839
acquisition of these technologies and

1159
00:44:57,839 --> 00:44:59,599
deployment of these technologies many

1160
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:01,520
times that are public private

1161
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,160
partnerships many times supported by

1162
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,800
international uh

1163
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,720
financing bodies

1164
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,800
and and none of these elements are

1165
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,359
really regarded again as different

1166
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,920
elements of who hold the power and how

1167
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,760
to make accountable the ones that hold

1168
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:20,240
the power so and your introduction also

1169
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,119
you you highlighted your own work in in

1170
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,000
in

1171
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:26,880
business accountability uh and i think

1172
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:30,480
that that's it's a very big part also of

1173
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,880
the the conversion between

1174
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:34,960
consumer protection

1175
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,680
anti-trust enforcement or regulation or

1176
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,400
competition regulation and and and data

1177
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:43,359
protection regulation and enforcement

1178
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,520
those are different

1179
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:48,079
points of entry for finally whole

1180
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:50,800
accountable the different companies and

1181
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,960
what we have seen in the deployment of

1182
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,480
these surveillance

1183
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,800
technologies particularly

1184
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,960
that was stressed during the pandemic

1185
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,319
and all the technology that we're

1186
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:01,599
deploying with the skills of the

1187
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,319
pandemic and many of them with purposes

1188
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,200
that

1189
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:08,000
persist beyond the pandemic and it's

1190
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,240
precisely that that we don't have the

1191
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:13,280
mechanism for really hold accountable

1192
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:15,599
and and to have more transparency in in

1193
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:18,000
the way in which this business are

1194
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,760
carried out and the way in which the

1195
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:21,359
particular technologies are being

1196
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:23,040
implemented the way in which the

1197
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:24,640
governments are negotiating them

1198
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,440
acquiring them providing public funding

1199
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:30,560
belonging to all the citizenship for for

1200
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:33,760
acquiring them so i think that that all

1201
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,160
that it's very intertwining and and we

1202
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,960
really will benefit of uh strengthening

1203
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:41,440
these different uh legal frameworks and

1204
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:44,079
and possibilities of enforcement in

1205
00:46:44,079 --> 00:46:47,839
order to ensure that finally uh

1206
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:51,680
the power is all a control

1207
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,240
