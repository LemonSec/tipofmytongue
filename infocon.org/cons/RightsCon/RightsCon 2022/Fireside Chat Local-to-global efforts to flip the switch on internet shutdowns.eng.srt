83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,480
been like since um you started doing

84
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,519
this work

85
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,400
and

86
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,959
what changes have you seen

87
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,879
um to the shutdown landscape

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:33,360
um thanks felicia uh

89
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,599
so i mean the journey has been

90
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,760
difficult right like so just looking at

91
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,280
where we are today just looking at you

92
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,360
know how the world is structured and in

93
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,720
the way that it's functioning right now

94
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,239
with all the wars and you know the

95
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,920
crimes against humanity and the genocide

96
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,360
that we're dealing with

97
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,159
uh so shutdowns have been you know part

98
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:51,920
and parcel of human rights violations

99
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,319
these days so the journey hasn't been uh

100
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:55,920
hasn't been fun or has not been

101
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,239
rewarding because we're seeing more and

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,640
more bad things happen uh but the

103
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
positive things that you know if i would

104
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,159
really map this journey i think the fact

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
that you know institutions like the un

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,000
or you know those of those organizations

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,840
that are you know that protect public

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
discourse like cpj and others have

109
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,159
recognized shutdowns to be a problem and

110
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,360
the fact that we're even having this

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,399
conversation with peggy today is is a is

112
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,720
a testament to to collect this also our

113
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,320
collective work not just mine but

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,160
everybody else that has been working on

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
shutdowns that shutdowns are real you

116
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,120
know

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,880
they're critical for the conversation

118
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,240
that we're having and they're critical

119
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,800
for for you know protecting human rights

120
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,120
um you know and when we really go into

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
the the details of the work i think for

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,759
me um i and you know my former

123
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,440
colleagues at access now know how i used

124
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,960
to be really stressed when we were about

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
to put out the shutdown report every

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
year because i know that if we miss one

127
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,360
shutdown that's intentional that has

128
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
been used to silence people to hide

129
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
egregious human rights violations it's

130
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:54,560
just

131
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,160
it would seem that we're not recognizing

132
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,680
the plight of people

133
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,680
so that was the most difficult part of

134
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
uh you know i think the journey for me

135
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,520
but also being able to to find those

136
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,080
shutdowns that no one has reported about

137
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
um and then we can really point our

138
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:09,840
fingers at the government saying or the

139
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,039
you know the culprit whether it's not

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,800
the government to say that you know you

141
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,639
shut down the internet so i think for me

142
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,479
it's a it's a combination of you know

143
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,919
very exciting things when you're like

144
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,440
yes we're having this conversation this

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,520
is becoming a real issue now they see it

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,120
they understand you know why we were

147
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,560
really screaming about international

148
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,639
dumps but then more shutdowns are

149
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,479
happening so i don't know how

150
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,800
how effective my work or other's work

151
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
have been um we haven't won yet so

152
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,919
yeah back to you alicia

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,479
thank you and um indeed we'll keep

154
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,960
fighting we haven't won yet but um we

155
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,840
still

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,240
uh um equipped to fight

157
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,120
um internet shutdowns all right um peggy

158
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,440

the u.n i want to come to you so the u.n

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,680
has also been part of this fight and

161
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,319
there's a recipient of numerous appeals

162
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,479
and complaints from civil society

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,000
whenever the internet is shut down um

164
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,319
our shutdowns now part of the united

165
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,960
nations agenda and how

166
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,199
is the u.n responding to that growing

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,720
threat to fundamental human rights

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,120
the two of you to access now to the

172
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,840
keeper on coalition um you've asked me

173
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,080
felicia about what the un is doing uh in

174
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,120
this area but i have to say that

175
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,960
it's it's an area that we have wanted to

176
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,280
do more work in for some time and and

177
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,000
part of that impetus was came from brett

178
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,520
solomon who was on the screen right

179
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,639
before uh we came into this this session

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,639
um who said this is one of those areas

181
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:47,759
where we need the un's voice and so our

182
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,840
team at un human rights has really been

183
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,759
looking for opportunities to do more in

184
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,240
this space um what we've seen is that

185
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,919
it's it's a call that's been taken up by

186
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,240
lots of parts of the un so we have the

187
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,080
special rapporteurs on freedom of

188
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,639
expression and and privacy that were

189
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,000
appointed um by the human rights council

190
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,080
and on uh freedom of association who've

191
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,479
all taken up this issue we've got human

192
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,240
rights treaty bodies who have looked at

193
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,960
this um in their work and then our high

194
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,960
commissioner the the

195
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,880
leading voice within the u.n system on

196
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,680
human rights has really uh spoken out on

197
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,680
these issues through her her through her

198
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,840
public statements most recently in

199
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,080
kazakhstan and sri lanka

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,960
we've also seen a step up because of the

201
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,560
engagement of the secretary general

202
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
himself on these issues he's made this

203
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,280
an issue in his roadmap for digital

204
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,000
cooperation and in his report about sort

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,240
of the future of multilateralism in the

206
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,120
u.n which we call our common agenda in

207
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,240
that report he specifically calls for us

208
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,800
to engage across the un system on

209
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
internet shutdowns so he's given my

210
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,919
office a platform to really reach out to

211
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,160
and engage with the rest of the u.n and

212
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,000
say this is not just something we need

213
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,319
to care about is something the whole un

214
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
needs to care about and finally and

215
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,639
something that we're really excited

216
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:09,120
about the human rights council asked the

217
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,280
high commissioner to submit to prepare

218
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
and submit a report on mapping trends

219
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,520
and impact of internet shutdowns and

220
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,440
that report is now done

221
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,759
um and is going to be released later

222
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,960
this month and we're looking forward to

223
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,520
using that report as a basis to really

224
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,359
ratchet up discussion on these issues

225
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,159
um thanks um peggy and to follow up um

226
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
very interesting to hear about the

227
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,360
upcoming reports and so could you

228
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,039
um

229
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,799
give us a sense of what is in the

230
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,160
reports um what informed this initiative

231
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,000
um you already mentioned but maybe if

232
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,120
there are any details you want to

233
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,279
provide and also could you highlight

234
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,279
some of the key findings and

235
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,680
recommendations in this report

236
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,600
great now happy to do that and you'll be

237
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,519
glad to know there are there are lots of

238
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,920
nice citations to the work of the keep

239
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,880
it on coalition um and and obviously

240
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,120
we're all very dependent on on that work

241
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
which has been so groundbreaking in

242
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,240
terms of really bringing attention to

243
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,440
these issues

244
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,800
part of what we tried to do in the

245
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,600
report is to really make it clear that

246
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,519
of course internet shutdowns by their

247
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,240
very nature restrict human rights they

248
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,560
um they undermine our ability to work

249
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,200
our ability to learn to get health care

250
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,120
um but they also of course block

251
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,040
people's ability to participate in the

252
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,880
discussions and decisions that shape

253
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,720
their lives and

254
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
that are essential for them to be able

255
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,640
to protect their own safety and their

256
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,920
own prosperity uh and and we've tried to

257
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,000
place it in that context this isn't just

258
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,440
something that affects a couple of

259
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,200
people here and there it's something

260
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,959
that affects whole societies and has

261
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,360
that impact and on that basis the

262
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
report's really clear about what needs

263
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,560
to happen and that will come as a

264
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,000
surprise to the listeners but we call

265
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,640
for states to just stop doing this you

266
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,480
know refrain from internet shutdowns um

267
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
in particular we say blake blanket

268
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
shutdowns um are are

269
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,360
inherently impose unacceptable

270
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,600
consequences and simply should never be

271
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,959
imposed

272
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:14,800
with regards to other

273
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,360
more limited efforts you know we're very

274
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
we're very clear that when we look at

275
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,640
the record we don't see any occasions

276
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,600
really um really almost never have those

277
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,279
been done in a way that's compliant with

278
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,839
human rights law human rights law sets

279
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,399
down very clear and substantial limits

280
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,160
um and you know they can't be

281
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,360
indiscriminate they can't be

282
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,440
disproportionate it has to be the least

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,680
intrusive measure and that's just simply

284
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,079
not the way states are using uh shutdown

285
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:42,880
so

286
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,279
you know all in all we're saying states

287
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,160
stop don't do this we also though really

288
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
emphasize that companies and

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,440
international organizations development

290
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,600
agencies and civil society you know we

291
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,760
all need to play our part in in taking

292
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
these these things up um

293
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,800
and just two more quick points we

294
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,680
emphasize that states also should not

295
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,839
ban block or criminalize the use of

296
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,240
encryption or circumvention tools or

297
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,000
particular communication channels such

298
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,720
as uh vpns um and in fact should be

299
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
providing access to those tools so this

300
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,120
is also you know and the shutdowns but

301
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,440
also let's make sure that we protect the

302
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,519
channels that that are allowing people

303
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,360
to to continue to have their rights

304
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:25,120
protected in a in a space where

305
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,959
shutdowns are occurring

306
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,079
and then finally i just want to

307
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:29,440
emphasize

308
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,519
you know the shutdowns report has to be

309
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
seen in the context of the evolving

310
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:36,000
digital landscape which itself poses big

311
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,839
challenges for human rights so some

312
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:39,760
states don't have to resort to shutdowns

313
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
as frequently because they're already

314
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,160
engaged in intensive um censorship

315
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,800
systematic content filtering and mass

316
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,800
surveillance and you know employing

317
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,200
troll army armies and cyber attacks and

318
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,200
targeted surveillance to to do their

319
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,000
dirty work so you know we we need to

320
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,320
take a a full-scale approach and look

321
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,240
both at shutdowns and and that these

322
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,200
other um ways in which uh human rights

323
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
are being attacked in the online space

324
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,240
thank you so much and i think that

325
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,120
you've got it all and indeed as the

326
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,440
capital coalition we always say that

327
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,360
fighting internationals

328
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,519
requires a collective effort and it's

329
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,600
great to see that the way chr is

330
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,120
highlighting that in the upcoming

331
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,800
reports and we are looking forward to

332
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:25,600
that

333
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
um okay berhan um i know you have some

334
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,959
comments so i want to check with you

335
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,760
um

336
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,600
peggy has mentioned

337
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,800
a few of the

338
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,519
highlights of the reports

339
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
how feasible are the key points that

340
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,800
freddie mentioned and how will they

341
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,560
impact those that are

342
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
living

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
through internet shutdowns from day to

344
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,399
day and also

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
how do you see us that is civil society

346
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
and the u.n

347
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,200
jointly achieving these um great

348
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,079
recommendations or key um highlights

349
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,519
that peggy just mentioned

350
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,320
um no just first to say congratulations

351
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
to peggy and team because

352
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,279
this is

353
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,959
uh we're very excited that this app

354
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:12,240
actually is going to come out and it's

355
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,200
going to

356
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
affect how we do our work and support

357
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,800
how we do our work i think

358
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:17,839
uh

359
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,079
so when i was previously had access now

360
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,440
peter meisleg had a google doc where

361
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,360
it's called internet shutdowns at the un

362
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,720
where he had like

363
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,639
i don't know how many interventions like

364
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:31,519
page page just where every like every

365
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,040
time internet shutdown is mentioned

366
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,639
within the un system

367
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,079
we that's the way that we used to

368
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:38,399
document how the u.n used to engage i'm

369
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,079
i'm i'm sure that document is still

370
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,160
there but now this is maybe we can just

371
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,760
get rid of that document and just to

372
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
just use this one because this is a

373
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
testament to you know the work that

374
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
we've been doing but also the u.n

375
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
recognizing this is is really critical

376
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,800
but not just for us i think but for the

377
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,079
millions and millions of people that

378
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:55,600
have been affected by this so for me i

379
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,360
think the fact that this is not just

380
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,760
hidden in 30 resolutions

381
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:01,760
is excellent and you know that you

382
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,839
really you're really putting a very

383
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,920
holistic approach to it as well it's not

384
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,680
just you know governments that shut down

385
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,680
the internet those just stop us riding

386
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,600
on the internet they also surveil they

387
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,399
also force digital ids they also censor

388
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,000
so i think that's holistic approach is

389
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,760
really needed and maybe even in the way

390
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:20,160
that our work should also move um for

391
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,839
forward i think that's really excellent

392
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,600
for me now when it comes to you know how

393
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,519
do we instrumentalize this is the key

394
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:27,440
question that i would have um and

395
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,800
especially you know when we're looking

396
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,800
at the u.n how do we instrumentalize

397
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,000
this when we're talking about school

398
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,240
exams and unicef works and unesco's

399
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,000
right how do we make this an agenda to

400
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
them when we're talking about you know

401
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,000
businesses when we're talking about you

402
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
know elevating poverty

403
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,680
because this does of course obviously

404
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,040
contribute to other forms of human

405
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,320
rights violation right like how do we

406
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,639
make sure that undp and unesco and

407
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
unicef and other even institutions are

408
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,680
also documenting this but also

409
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,920
understanding this issue to be part and

410
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,480
parcel of any human rights related work

411
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,440
that they're doing whether it's

412
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,959
development work or human rights so i

413
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,959
think that's going to be really critical

414
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,800
then now when we're looking at ourselves

415
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
as civil society um for me one of the

416
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,160
things that i always struggle with is

417
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,040
like

418
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,199
i you know and and felicia and the team

419
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:11,360
knows this is like how do we make make

420
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,720
this

421
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,480
you know we need to bring this

422
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,880
conversations to where it's happening

423
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,240
because right we need to have this

424
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,760
conversation in ethiopia right now we

425
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,040
need to have this conversation in sri

426
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,399
lanka we need to have this conversation

427
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,880
in tajikistan and india

428
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:26,320
because a lot of these conversations are

429
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,000
happening in geneva are happening in

430
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,199
places where

431
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:30,720
you know this conversation don't really

432
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,320
they don't like you you're not shutting

433
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,000
down the internet anytime soon in geneva

434
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,279
right like so how do we make sure that

435
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,800
this is becoming a subreddit another

436
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,720
country issue and that your offices i

437
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,160
think especially the human rights

438
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,399
offices are documenting these things and

439
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,959
you know they they understand

440
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,720
shutdowns to be a holistic problem from

441
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,399
a human rights point of view i think

442
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,000
that's going to be really important and

443
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,480
critical and them working with the local

444
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,320
civil society organization local human

445
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,560
rights defenders you know the the sub

446
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,320
regional governments that the regional

447
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,680
governments that we have is going to be

448
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,079
really critical so um i think the first

449
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:04,000
you know the first big part is you know

450
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,360
you guys being able to put on such a

451
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,720
holistic

452
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,360
document is one but the next thing is

453
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,040
how do we implement this how do we make

454
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
sure that this is a health issue who's

455
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
taking this up when we're talking about

456
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,880
the fact that you know people integrate

457
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,639
don't have access to medication and they

458
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,000
can't reach out to anyone to say they

459
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,360
don't have medication right now because

460
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,199
the internet has been completely shut

461
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,600
down for over a year um so that's like

462
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,519
the so that's the sort of implementation

463
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,560
is where my head is going

464
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,320
yeah um definitely i agree with you and

465
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,720
actually i had a follow-up question for

466
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,680
peggy um to kind of give us a sense of

467
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,920
how the implementation

468
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,880
process would go or would look like and

469
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:46,800
uh thank you berhan for

470
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,560
starting that but then i will come back

471
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,199
to you again peggy to ask could you let

472
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:51,920
us

473
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,639
know how your office and especially your

474
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,720
office has access to high level

475
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,800
officials from various governments and

476
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,079
companies around the world so who can do

477
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,720
more and what are some of the avenues

478
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,119
available to engage with them on these

479
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,958
recommendations that you've highlighted

480
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
yeah berhana has helped me out as well

481
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,000
because she basically you know preloaded

482
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,760
some of the key things that we need to

483
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,559
do

484
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:19,760
one of the things that the report

485
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,760
emphasizes and i think is a particularly

486
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,599
important aspect of it

487
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
is the fact that there are a lot of

488
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,799
conversations happening about

489
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,160
connectivity

490
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,160
but they somehow don't talk about all

491
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,400
these ways in which connectivity

492
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,120
is you know voluntarily blocked from

493
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,520
people who who actually do have it and

494
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
then it's cut off right so one of the

495
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,160
things we've emphasized in the report is

496
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,200
really engaging in that conversation and

497
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,799
bringing that conversation and the

498
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,200
people engaged in that conversation into

499
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,520
the discussion around internet shutdowns

500
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,160
and you know in particular we look at

501
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,120
um you know how they can do this in

502
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,280
terms of you know the types of aid that

503
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,440
they're giving around programs to

504
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,360
develop um uh digital connection and and

505
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,400
uh connectivity broadly and say that you

506
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,880
know there ought to be some um basis

507
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
within that to make sure that once we're

508
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,440
connected there there is there is a

509
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,600
constraint on on how it can be turned

510
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,919
off as well and so that would also sort

511
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:21,919
of raise the profile and engage other

512
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:23,919
people in the conversation i mean we

513
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,520
look at things like our partner

514
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,679
organization the itu that just issued a

515
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,160
new connectivity report which is super

516
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,640
important because it really emphasizes

517
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,559
the the need for universal and

518
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,880
meaningful connectivity but in the same

519
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,039
time within that report they don't talk

520
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,039
about shutdowns except in

521
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,200
in the specific context of where

522
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,520
disasters have led to disruption such as

523
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,000
what happened in tonga so that's the

524
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,400
type of thing we need to make uh happen

525
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,480
it's got to be a whole of house effort

526
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,760
um in addressing uh shutdowns and making

527
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,520
making sure that that we're engaging

528
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,360
more people in in this in this

529
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,440
discussion as burhan has said

530
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,200
i'd make two other quick points one is

531
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
that

532
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,559
the issues around transparency um it's

533
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,240
actually two connected points

534
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,480
transparency and the second point is is

535
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,080
monitoring and reporting the

536
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,240
transparency side is something that

537
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,919
we've heard from the global network

538
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:18,400
initiative for years that we need

539
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
companies and states to do better on the

540
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:23,360
transparency side so we need states to

541
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,679
you know really feel an obligation to

542
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
report on what they're doing on internet

543
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,880
shutdowns um and and we also think that

544
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,559
companies can do much more in here and

545
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:34,240
this is something of course that ranking

546
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,799
digital rights has has really made clear

547
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,880
in their reporting as well

548
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,039
they show that there's room for a lot of

549
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:41,840
um

550
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,760
improvement from telecommunication

551
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,520
companies who don't really actively

552
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,360
provide information on their practices

553
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,919
relating to shutdowns so we want more

554
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:53,200
transparency um on these issues and that

555
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,679
becomes even more important when as as

556
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
braham said we link it into surveillance

557
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,480
issues and targeted denials of service

558
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,640
that you know may not be are covert in

559
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,919
in different ways

560
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,400
um the the other thing i

561
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,159
mentioned was the reporting monitoring

562
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,240
side now i don't want to put uh access

563
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,640
now or keep it uh keep it on coalition

564
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,880
out of business but we also do think as

565
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,480
you've said that this is something that

566
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,640
the u.n itself really needs to be

567
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,039
collecting the data on shutdowns and and

568
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,120
reporting on it in a way that you know

569
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:26,480
has that imprimatur of of the un um

570
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,640
looking at the impacts of these issues

571
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,640
both in terms of what's happening and

572
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
also in terms of their impact across

573
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:34,240
society so we want to do more of the

574
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
type of work that we've been able to do

575
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,480
on this report

576
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,080
amazing um

577
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,880
well

578
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,159
okay

579
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,600
i

580
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,280
i see from

581
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,600
where we started that is from

582
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,039
when we started monitoring internet

583
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,080
shutdowns another keep it on campaign so

584
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,360
now we've made so much progress

585
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,200
even though internet shutdowns are still

586
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,120
happening i think that we have all

587
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,679
collectively made a lot of progress and

588
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:04,640
so

589
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:07,760
my question or what keeps me at night is

590
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,760
what else can we do

591
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,120
to end internet shutdowns

592
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,400
and i'm throwing this to both of you to

593
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,960
um share some thoughts with us what else

594
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,240
can we do

595
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,559
um to end internet shutdowns or maybe

596
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,600
behind you want to go first

597
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,440
um

598
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,120
surprise i've never thought about that

599
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,440
question of course i have like it's the

600
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,480
it's uh

601
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
because you know i like i honestly i i

602
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,360
feel very weird about sanctions because

603
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,840
sanctions affect actual individuals and

604
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,039
you know people

605
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,080
but

606
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,919
we need to make it expensive to shut

607
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,440
down the internet

608
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,880
for for the individuals that are

609
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,720
shutting down the entire right like so

610
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,280
for governments for businesses

611
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,039
it should not be allowed

612
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:55,600
if you do it it becomes because

613
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
it's the money is what the companies

614
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
care about right like i think so make it

615
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,360
extremely extremely expensive for them

616
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,440
to to shut down the internet

617
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
if orange shuts down the internet and

618
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:06,960
central african republic they can be

619
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,200
prosecuted in france that's because

620
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,440
that's where they're hq in ifudaphone

621
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,159
does that they can be mitigated in in in

622
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:15,200
the uk

623
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,840
uh you know if the argentinian

624
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,120
government i don't want to mention any

625
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,280
other governments here because there's

626
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,880
but if the argentinian government shuts

627
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,080
down the internet put real sanctions on

628
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,760
the individuals not the individuals

629
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,000
identified to have ordered the shutdown

630
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,679
i think that's

631
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,440
we just have to make it expensive

632
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,039
because people dying

633
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
because because of shutdowns is not

634
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,440
convincing government so we have to ask

635
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
you know where does it hurt and that's

636
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,760
where we need to kick

637
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,240
so just jumping in i i agree fully with

638
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,720
what gohan said and would just sort of

639
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,360
take a more u.n approach on it but but

640
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,600
it's it's like looking at we need to

641
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,840
move the window on this right now you

642
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:58,640
know

643
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,559
there really is just not a full

644
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,440
understanding about how dramatic and the

645
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,280
impacts of these shutdowns are and

646
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,480
there's even a little bit of

647
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,400
understanding you know the sympathy

648
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,240
within governments oh yeah you know they

649
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,159
just shut it down around an election

650
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,919
well that's actually the worst time to

651
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,320
shut it down that's when people need the

652
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,720
internet so you know we we need to

653
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,600
educate we need to push we need to pull

654
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,840
our allies together and we need to

655
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:27,200
basically move that window so that um as

656
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,679
as berhan said the the cost be the

657
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,559
economic or societal or shame or

658
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,640
whatever we want to put on it you know

659
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,440
it's not a cost-free thing to to take

660
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,600
these actions um and i do think we have

661
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,120
a lot of tools and i think we're coming

662
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,600
together around these these issues and i

663
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,440
think you know there there is a role to

664
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,000
play uh for governments who understand

665
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,080
these things you know being more vocal

666
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
and what they're saying about shutdowns

667
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,480
i as you've heard i'm calling on my un

668
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
colleagues to see this as an issue that

669
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,559
threatens their goals on on development

670
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,880
on peace and security and obviously you

671
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,640
know we work side by side with civil

672
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,960
society who's who's really you know the

673
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,960
ones who can really help us document and

674
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,120
look at you know what really is the

675
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,880
impact of of these uh measures and and

676
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,039
and i think that is compelling evidence

677
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:18,080
about how we can't afford to in in any

678
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:21,678
way to have this continue to happen

679
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
um

680
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,240
i agree with all the points um you've

681
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,200
we've mentioned and i i think that

682
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,520
we need to pinch them where they feel

683
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,120
let's move and then

684
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:36,320
maybe

685
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,480
they will put an end to internationals

686
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,440
and of course the impact of shutdowns as

687
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,200
you said

688
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
i always say that we cannot quantify um

689
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,600
the impacts that international don't

690
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,039
have on people

691
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:49,840
um

692
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:52,640
they are bad in shorts and governments

693
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,480
must um refrain from um imposing them

694
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:00,080
at their hand you have the opportunity

695
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,880
to

696
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,400
be certain right in front of peggy

697
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:08,960
who is from the un's most powerful

698
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,200
institution on human rights

699
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:13,360
and so i want to give you

700
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
the chance

701
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,880
to

702
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,240
leave

703
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,559
a message for her to take back

704
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:22,080
with regards to

705
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,440
next steps

706
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
and

707
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,039
how we can move forward

708
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,039
regarding this conversation

709
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,120
so what would you want to tell her to

710
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
think back to her office

711
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,400
on the issue of intellectual dance

712
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:38,799
um

713
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:42,080
so obviously i'm i'm ethiopian so i'm

714
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,159
i'm sure you know that

715
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,840
the really difficult time that that

716
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:46,960
we're going through i was talking to a

717
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,559
friend of mine this morning just to

718
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:51,440
check on him on how he's doing um

719
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,240
and

720
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,640
you know the internet connectivity has

721
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,600
been cut for and for

722
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,600
about 18 months now

723
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,039
um and he still doesn't know if his

724
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,520
mother is alive or dead so that's the

725
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,960
conversation that we're having right

726
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,200
like because he can't reach her you know

727
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,440
she needs diabetic medication there's no

728
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,120
medication available there's no way to

729
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,440
get through so honestly for 18 months he

730
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,960
doesn't know if his mother is alive or

731
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:15,840
dead

732
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,080
um and he just wants to know and one of

733
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,440
the ways to know is to be able to reach

734
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,799
out to people right like so i think for

735
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,200
me it's that that's the core of it and

736
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,799
the reason why the internet is shut down

737
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,480
in ethiopia is to

738
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,640
hide egregious human rights violations

739
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,960
crimes against humanity war crimes the

740
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,320
reason why

741
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,320
you know in mario paul the first things

742
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
that were targeted was the network was

743
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,320
because they wanted to hide egregious

744
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,880
human rights violations and tajikistan

745
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,799
the same thing so for me we need to also

746
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
really ask what happens when the

747
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
internet goes off and the people that

748
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,159
disappear with the internet

749
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:49,440
um so

750
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,039
we've you know we've done a lot of the

751
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
work of making sure that this is a topic

752
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,559
that we talk about

753
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,240
but really understanding

754
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,799
also how people disappear and the impact

755
00:26:58,799 --> 00:26:59,919
it has

756
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:01,840
um because it needs to be addressed and

757
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,360
for me like if i would

758
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,120
if i would give anything to you to take

759
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
to your office and your team it's not to

760
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,240
say that they don't know this i think

761
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,159
they do they they're very close to this

762
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,880
issue but it's to really stress

763
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,039
yeah people disappear they never come

764
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:15,919
back

765
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:17,600
when the internet goes off so what do we

766
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,000
do about that

767
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,360
can i jump in to just uh you know

768
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,240
respond to bear huh yeah i i it's

769
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:28,960
that is exactly what people need to hear

770
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,520
right and and and it's our job to figure

771
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,559
out a way

772
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,399
to get that message to the people that

773
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,240
can make a difference on this and and i

774
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,240
take your point from earlier as well

775
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,840
that too many of these conversations

776
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,600
happen in in you know the lovely

777
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,600
conference rooms here in geneva and we

778
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,120
need to make sure that they're happening

779
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,360
in the places where people are directly

780
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,960
affected by these things and that's part

781
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,480
of why i stress

782
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,799
this work across the un because that's

783
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,720
what we can do through that we can

784
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:57,120
engage the you know the un country teams

785
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,279
that exist in these countries and and

786
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,039
you know work with them to figure out

787
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,200
what more they can do on these issues as

788
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,360
well that's exactly the type of work we

789
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,840
need to do and we're committed to do

790
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,799
going forward and yeah absolutely

791
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,960
not your friend and everybody like them

792
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,880
should should be able to have answers to

793
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,120
those questions and that i guess is the

794
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,480
other thing we have to do while we're

795
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,880
working on this is that we also have the

796
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,399
same time we're raising the cost of

797
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,120
shutting it down we also have to do

798
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,559
everything we can to make sure that what

799
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,799
they're trying to do doesn't work right

800
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,559
so the other way we're working on that

801
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:31,679
is that

802
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:33,039
if if they're doing it because they

803
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,559
don't want this the human rights

804
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,720
situation to be known then it's our job

805
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
to make sure it doesn't work that that

806
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,559
we get the word out about what the human

807
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,039
rights situation is so you know it's not

808
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,480
worth shutting the internet down because

809
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,559
it's not working um in terms of that

810
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,480
objective so we're also very committed

811
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,240
to to making sure that they're not

812
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,880
successful um in blocking that

813
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,840
information as well

814
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,880
thank you so much both of you and i

815
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,720
think the message we are taking from

816
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,520
this conversation is that

817
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,760
we are doing a lot of work but we still

818
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,080
have to do more with um in the fight

819
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,640
against internationals and so i would

820
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,720
like to say a very big thank you to all

821
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,159
of you that

822
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,559
joined us in this conversation

823
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,240
and to ensure that you continue to fight

824
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,799
and push back um against internet

825
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,720
shutdowns i really had a great time

826
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,520
chatting with both of you and i guess

827
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:29,440
our audience the same

828
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:31,440
thank you both for the great work and

829
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,200
you're doing and let's continue to

830
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:35,919
collaborate in order to stamp out

831
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,080
internet shutdowns and their impacts on

832
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:41,120
fundamental human rights and thank you

833
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,520
all for your participation and enjoy the

834
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:46,080
rest of the sessions at wrightsville

835
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:49,360
