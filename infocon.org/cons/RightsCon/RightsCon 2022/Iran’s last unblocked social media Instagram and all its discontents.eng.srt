world

20
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,359
and inside iran can follow along with

21
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,600
this discussion which you know we have

22
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
seen in recent weeks

23
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,799
um has been really impacting the iranian

24
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,880
community

25
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,560
as we know

26
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,560
the internet and access to the internet

27
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,920
is a highly

28
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,520
contested and fraught space inside of

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,080
iran and in fact

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,520
met us hold a special role inside iran

31
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,560
in that they host the only social media

32
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,880
platform that is essentially not

33
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,720
connected to the iranian state that is

34
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,000
uncensored and so this is really

35
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,240
important for you know millions of

36
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,600
iranian users who don't use vpns or are

37
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,240
not tech savvy enough to you know

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
turn on their vpns and connect to

39
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
twitter or connect to facebook or

40
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,600
telegram which are you know other

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:53,600
popular social media that the rest of

42
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,119
the world uses that is blocked for iran

43
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,119
one of the major issues that we have

44
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,719
been seen and i personally as a

45
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,240
researcher and advocate have been

46
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,520
noticing over the past few years is

47
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,160
um just amounts and amounts of content

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,200
takedown in the persian language and so

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,239
this is really the crux of the

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,560
conversation we are having today which

51
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,879
is trying to understand

52
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,120
exactly what is happening

53
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,080
to persian language users on instagram

54
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,319
you know on this last kind of space for

55
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,319
freedom of expression and

56
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,959
um access to a unhindered platform

57
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:34,800
so there's a lot of different issues

58
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
that have been going on i mean most

59
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
recently we've been tackling the issues

60
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,200
of protest takedowns

61
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,160
and

62
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,840
this discussion was really meant to

63
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,519
bring together

64
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,680
you know folks who

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
are content creators unfortunately one

66
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,920
of our speakers cena valliola couldn't

67
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,239
make it to the session in the end but he

68
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,480
was a prominent content creator and he

69
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,840
was going to speak from the point of

70
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
view of you know producing entertainment

71
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
or satire content and how

72
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,760
meta policies impact

73
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,760
on that level

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,959
but fortunately enough we have rana

75
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
rahim poor with us today who's a

76
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,720
highly respected persian language and

77
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,480

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,519
for the bbc world service and bbc um

79
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:23,680
persian and she's

80
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,159
has a lot of great perspective in terms

81
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,760
of you know what the persian community

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,920
has um felt in terms of using instagram

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:34,400
the role of instagram to help

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,560
you know independent journalism

85
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,440
um and various other kinds of content

86
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:41,280
that she's been following that have been

87
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,400
impacted by meta's policies

88
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,400
unfortunately we have another speaker

89
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,400
that wasn't able to make it today that

90
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,799

91
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,760

92
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,360
board um thankfully she sent us um a

93
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
small five-minute clip to kind of go

94
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,280

themselves and then we obviously have

98
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,879

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:19,040
um so we have muhammad here who comes

102
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,400

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,880
in doi which is dangerous organizations

104
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
and individuals

110
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,000
discussion and i'll i'll plan dooley's

and thank you muhammad and special

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,720
thanks to writescon for allowing this

117
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,840
conversation to happen which has been

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,560
ongoing between media organizations and

119
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,280
activists and meta and we're also

120
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,759
as an iranian i would i'm

121
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,840
thankful to metta for providing a

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,080
platform for us to

123
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,960
share our news with the viewers and for

124
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,639
from the civil society

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,520
without meta i can't i'm not sure how

126
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,520
many of us would have found out about

127
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,160
what was going on inside the country um

128
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,120
but

129
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,120
it's specifically for that reason why

130
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
meta becomes so crucial in our

131
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,639
day-to-day job as a bbc persian um

132
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,560
journalist we rely a lot on

133
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,160
user-generated content because bbc

134
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
persian like many other persian

135
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,520
foreign-based

136
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,680
stations we cannot operate inside the

137
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,039
country and we rely heavily on citizen

138
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,680
journalism and the content that those

139
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,919
people risking their lives are

140
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,960
publishing on platforms like instagram

141
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,919
facebook and then us journalists we

142
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,199
that's so

143
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,280
sometimes that's our only window into

144
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
what's going on inside the country

145
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,080
that's why it's crucial for us

146
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,520
also um bbc persian has over 17 million

147
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,520
followers on instagram it's the largest

148
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,080
news persian news organization

149
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,280
on uh

150
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,160
instagram and this allows us to

151
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,919
inform people inside the country of

152
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:15,680
what's going on because the satellite

153
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,720
channel is often jammed by the iranian

154
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
authorities so this that's there's this

155
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:23,520
dynamic relationship between media

156
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,039
organizations and meta platforms

157
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,120
and it makes it very crucial

158
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,759
and as massa uh mentioned earlier

159
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,479
several stories hashtags have been

160
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
removed from instagram and facebook

161
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,120
recently which makes it very difficult

162
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,919
and we will get back to it later after

163
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,919
we hear from muhammad

164
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440

172
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,680
through which we draw the iron on

173
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
content on instagram and facebook

174
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,919

00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,759
years of which we're in the united

179
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,960
nations

180
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,280
and i built most of my understanding

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,520
about the dynamics between social media

182
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,440
and freedom of expression through being

183
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,440
one of the millions who joined in the

184
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,199
streets and during the arab spring in

185

meta oversight board can be helpful to

211
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,120
persian communities and others who are

212
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,839
facing uh particularly harsh content

213
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,240
moderation practices from the part of

214
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,360
instagram and meta in general

215
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,799

site board and i'm also a digital rights

219

220
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,080
highlight content moderation problems in

221
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,080
other parts of the world when i say

222
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,640
others i mean not the united states not

223
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
the european union uh i'm leading

224
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,000
antonix

225
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
which is a french ngo and we have done

226
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,160
extensive work in in africa and latin

227
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,320
america and particularly in brazil

228
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,320
well with regards to some of the

229
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,040
decisions of the oversight board that

230
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
might be helpful uh in the cases

231
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
highlighted today i would like to

232
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,560
mention three i'm thinking for instance

233
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,000
uh about and not the the cases per se

234
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
but rather the recommendations that we

235
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,160
made through uh making a decision on a

236
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,040
case because as a reminder

237
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,160
as i think you've been muted i can't

238
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,800
hear you make broader recommendations to

239
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,920
which

240
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,279
made through uh making a decision on a

241
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
case because as a reminder the board

242
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,920
does make binding decisions on cases of

243
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,640
specific cases that are submitted to it

244
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,519
to us either by users or by meta but

245
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,200
we're also allowed to make

246
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,640
recommendations and we do not hesitate

247
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,680
to use the cases individual cases to

248
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,120
make broader recommendations to which

249
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,240
facebook and instagram must respond

250
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,640
publicly and say whether or not it would

251
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,240
implement them so one of the

252
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,480
recommendations we've made was to tell

253
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,680
the company

254
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,839
you must make sure that your community

255
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,959
standards your role are available in all

256
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:36,320
languages

257
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,360
so that all users around the world can

258
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,480
understand what exactly is or is not

259
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,360
allowed on your platforms

260
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,040
this might seem as obvious but

261
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,279
we found out at the meta recite board

262
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,920
while studying a case from india we

263
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,320
found out that community standards were

264
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
not available in punjabi which is a

265
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,079
language spoken by more than 100 million

266
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:03,519
people

267
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,880
yes

268
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,040
the second recommendation that i wanted

269
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,240
to highlight today which speaks to

270
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,720
the internal processes and has shed

271
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,560
light uh

272
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
on the uh some of the dysfunctions

273
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,240
internal dysfunctions with regards to uh

274
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,720
content moderation and content and

275
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,880
the guidelines that content moderators

276
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
specifically receive uh we've received a

277
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,560
case

278
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,360
that was dealing with the um solitary

279
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:35,120
confinement of the leader of the pkk

280
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,519
uh a party that is not

281
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,760
an organization that is not allowed that

282
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,839
is considered as a dangerous

283
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,839
organizations

284
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,800
of

285
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,800
members of the said organization and

286
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,040
particularly their leaders and if i

287
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,120
remember well that kevit to the policy

288
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,639
had been developed

289
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,920
kind of specifically for the leader

290
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,480
of the pkk abdullah well that kevin got

291
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
lost in translation

292
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,279
uh

293
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:19,040
some ways somehow it did not reach the

294
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:19,839
uh

295
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,079
well the content moderators

296
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,320
who were supposed to apply it despite

297
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,000
the fact that this

298
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,920
policy had been existing since 2018 we

299
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,279
received the case in 2020

300
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,720
well uh

301
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,760
this again is a a way in which we have

302
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,519
recommended to the company that it

303
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:42,079
consistently

304
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,440
uh applies its uh guidelines and

305
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,200
policies

306
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,680
well it with content moderators

307
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,160
consistently around the world that

308
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,519
distance should not be an excuse for uh

309
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,760
lesser content moderation

310
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
robust practices and seriousness that's

311
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
the second recommendation that i wanted

312
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,399
to uh

313
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,440
highlight

314
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,480
um

315
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:10,160
and then related to uh uh the the

316
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,519
some of the cases that have been

317
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,920
discussed here we have told publicly

318
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,720
and recommended publicly to the company

319
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,600
that

320
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,880
meta

321
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,120
should publish

322
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:25,680
a breakdown of government requests for

323
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
content takedown

324
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,639
this information until the board made a

325
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,200
decision uh with regards to the

326
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,320
case

327
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,360
sorry

328
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:40,240
case in palestine well

329
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:43,360
the the until that date that information

330
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,160
was

331
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,839
kept i would almost say secretly by uh

332
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,120
the platform

333
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,360
and by meta by facebook and instagram

334
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,120
particularly so

335
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
we have recommended the company to

336
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,240
publish

337
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,880
uh to be transparent about the requests

338
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,839
it

339
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,680
receives organizations from shadow

340
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,240
government units um

341
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,120
to to publish uh the content takedown

342
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
request that they receive such as the

343
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,600
the privacy violation request that they

344
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,160
received from government uh well it's

345
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,920
important to publish those information

346
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,320
especially at the time when democratic

347
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,120
principles when we're trying to build

348
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
as a community as a world

349
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:26,639
we're trying to build democracy

350
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,959
principles that we'll govern that must

351
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,279
govern any endeavor on the cyber space

352
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,160
um

353
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:35,600
well these are

354
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,360
three recommendations that i wanted to

355
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,279
highlight but of course we have made

356
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,760
more recommendations than that i think

357
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,240
by today it's more than 100

358
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,600
recommendations to which

359
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,040
sorry i think

360
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,440
julie's uh

361
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,160
julie's interventions uh ended abruptly

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,839
but i think they got to the crux of a

363
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,519
lot of the things we want to talk about

364
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:07,920
which is i mean the oversight board is a

365
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:11,040
really important mechanism by which we

366
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
hope that a lot of the content takedowns

367
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,160
we've been

368
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,440
dealing with um get recommended as of

369
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,160
yet we have obviously not had a

370
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,120
particular um iran-focused or persian

371
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,920
language focused case but like julie

372
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,320
said there have been cases that have

373
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,199
maybe helped um inform

374
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,759
cases we've had um especially in terms

375
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,920
of the use of doi dangerous

376
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,399
organizations and individuals

377
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,399
and how you can look at the different

378
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,440
nuances in talking about organizations

379
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,320
uh on that list which i think is a

380
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,480
is a thing that we encounter a lot

381
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
because um one organization in iran is

382
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,399
prominently listed on the doi list and

383
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,720
there's ton tons of news and content

384
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,680
generated about that organization um and

385
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,800
so sometimes the nuances of you know if

386
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,839
is this criticism of that organization

387
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:07,600
is this you know satire about that

388
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,759
organization we've often seen it get

389
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,880
gets um lost uh in a lot of the content

390
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,320
we're discussing

391
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,560
um it's unfortunate that

392
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,639
julie actually isn't here to you know

393
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,199
engage in dialogue i know they've also

394
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:22,560
worked beyond

395
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
cases that can help inform the

396
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,320
implementation of doi

397
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:29,279
they've done uh work on cases related to

398
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,839
protests which also has been relevant

399
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:32,720
here

400
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,519
um

401
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,880
so we had a a plan of going tackling

402
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,079
through different topics today um and

403
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,000
the dangerous organizations and

404
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,480
individuals was supposed to be our uh

405
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:46,639
last topic of conversation but i'm just

406
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,959
gonna move it up just so

407
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:52,399
um we can dovetail off of uh the the

408
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,079
interventions that julie made um so i i

409
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
would love to turn to

410
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,839
muhammad who i know

411
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,160
um this is this is kind of your

412
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,240
expertise doi the famous doi list um one

413
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,000
of i think the problems

414
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
and i i've had to have this discussion

415
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,160
with a lot of iranians because you know

416
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
they depend on instagram but they don't

417
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,720
often know transparently

418
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,559
you know what the red lines are like

419
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,959
what are all the organizations on the

420
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,919
doi list and so far i think the only

421
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,760
kind of information there has been has

422
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,919
been a leak by the intercept that listed

423
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,840
a lot of the organizations

424
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,760
and you know i've spoken to content

425
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,000
creators that you satire on politics in

426
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
iran um like one of the the speakers i

427
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,080
was supposed to be on today and they

428
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,840
said you know they've referred to that

429
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
leak in the intercept to make sure that

430
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,679
they're not crossing any lines they're

431
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,919
not you know mentioning any of the banks

432
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:48,080
that are on the doi list um in their

433
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,720
satire so yeah i'd love to get some

434
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
uh comments from you muhammad on the

435
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,000
implementation of doi and if um you know

436
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,640
what julie has said is true in terms of

437
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
a kind of a gap between the policy and

438
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,480
often the implementation as well

439
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
thanks massa uh that's a that's a big

440
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,400
question so there are many details and

441
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,799
let me let me try to just break them

442
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,039
down one by one and let me actually

443
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
start by saying how valuable we think

444
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,320
the oversight board is

445
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:21,200
we extremely value their work their

446
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,720
recommendations

447
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,120
and their insights and and policy and

448
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,360
policy sometimes also

449
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
clear policy advice

450
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,000
julie and her fellow members of those of

451
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,600
the oversight board are doing an

452
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,000
extremely impactful job

453
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,799
and we value their recommendations very

454
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,919
very high

455
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,160
and we share also so when the oversight

456
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
board as julie said they

457
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,919
they issue a decision related to a

458
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,840
specific piece of content

459
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
but also they provide

460
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,360
um policy advice

461
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,160
and

462
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,600
their decisions regarding piece of

463
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,799
content is a binding one we comply with

464
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,039
that decision instantly

465
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,400
um and

466
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:03,360
the provider the provider policy advice

467
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,720
are also things that we publicly share

468
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,880
the progress of compliance with the

469
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:10,880
board and with the users in our in a

470
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,440
quarterly basis so for instance the

471
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,400
board now according to the last quarter

472
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,440
which has 55 recommendations

473
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:22,240
we have complied with 19 of them and 17

474
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,840
and 515 are actually in the pipeline um

475
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,240
so and we shared that information

476
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
publicly so that the public know the

477
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,640
impact that the oversight board

478
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,679
has on meta's policies and julie

479
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:37,760
mentioned specific examples and i can

480
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,840
mention even more but

481
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,000
for the auger line case for instance

482
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,320
this policy related to the respect of

483
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,840
human rights

484
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,640
of designated individuals is now even in

485
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
the community standards because of the

486
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,240
oversight board

487
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,760
recommendation and we took that

488
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,320
recommendation seriously and complied um

489
00:19:56,320 --> 00:19:59,039
directly the oversight board's decisions

490
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:01,039
or recommendations either on policy or

491
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,840
product or transparency get also within

492
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,159
different teams roadmaps so that we

493
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,080
ensure that they are you know the

494
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:11,520
appropriate process for implementation

495
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
that's that that's just to start to to

496
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,559
pick up on on judy's extremely important

497
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,400
points um

498
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
when it comes to the dui policy or the

499
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
dangerous organization's individuals

500
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,720
policy the objective of this policy is

501
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,720
to prevent offline harm to prevent

502
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,360
dangerous actors from utilizing social

503
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,400
media to spread their propaganda or to

504
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,640
incite violence or to recruit and

505
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,280
fundraise or further their goals using

506
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,559
our services

507
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,159
so it's

508
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,320
extremely helpful

509
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,720
to have the policy and the technologies

510
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,919
that help us act as fast as possible in

511
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,600
preventing that type of behavior from

512
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,440
being secured in our platform

513
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,320
and according to the policy we prevent

514
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,200
the praise um remove sorry praise

515
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,760
substantive support and representation

516
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,240
of entities and let me just explain that

517
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,120
in a little bit more of more details

518
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,880
although we share that publicly also in

519
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,120
the community standards praise is

520
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,600
speaking more positively and justifying

521
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,240
the violence or the activity over the

522
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,799
dangerous organization or giving it a

523
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:19,039
sense of achievement which is part of

524
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,200
the whole spectrum of of dangerous

525
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,280
organizations propaganda spreading the

526
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,200
substantive report is

527
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,280
attempting to to raise funds to recruit

528
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,559
and representation is actually having

529
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,240
presence on the platform

530
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,640
however we allow

531
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,960
this course that are related to

532
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,000
news reporting condemnation neutral

533
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,640
discussion and disapproval through

534
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
satire

535
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,280
but muhammad i think um i think a lot of

536
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,440
our listeners they're kind of aware that

537
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,799
the policy

538
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,799
and i think a lot of the communities

539
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:55,039
that we work with they're very much

540
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
against um the revolutionary guards but

541
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:59,440
you know the ongoing problem in this

542
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
particular community is that we are not

543
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,320
seeing that nuance applied like i've

544
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,720
been working with a dissident rapper

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,039
that's in exile and he created

546
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,159
music um that was uh you know

547
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,080
criticizing the revolutionary guards and

548
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,039
his artwork was the revolutionary guards

549
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,520
logo kind of made with graffiti for the

550
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,919
album art and every time this was posted

551
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,440
it would just get automatically removed

552
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,720
even though it was very clear in the

553
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,400
captions album art but um i mean it

554
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,679
seemed like there was some sort of

555
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,400
automated um detection that instagram

556
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,320
was using that there wasn't even room

557
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
for the moderation to have any nuance to

558
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,120
understand okay this is criticism this

559
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,919
is satire this is art that's not in

560
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,320
support of this organization and so this

561
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,919
is the type of these are the type of

562
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:48,640
cases we see every day we see the policy

563
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,960
is against support but in actual

564
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
implementation of you know the hundreds

565
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,720
of cases we see this is not actually

566
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
what's happening

567
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,039
so

568
00:22:57,039 --> 00:22:57,919
one

569
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,600
it's it's important also to highlight

570
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,960
that one we train our reviewers on how

571
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,840
to understand the context in which the a

572
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,640
given content is being shared but it's

573
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
also important that we share that on the

574
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:11,679
community standards it's also important

575
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:14,240
for the users to make

576
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,039
to make it explicit and clear that the

577
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,880
intention of the content is not to play

578
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,280
support or represent a designated entity

579
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,760
um so this especially in news reporting

580
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,520
and it's not only a farsi issue no or

581
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,200
not really specifically related to the

582
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,200
persian market or the patient

583
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,760
users um it's a new one station

584
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,159
extremely critical to strike the right

585
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,480
balance between assessing whether the

586
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,960
piece of content actually aims to

587
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,640
further a dangerous organization's

588
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,919
agenda or it's factually neutrally

589
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,840
reporting

590
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,080
or engaged with the activity of the

591
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,159
dangerous organization

592
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,720
and let me hear explain also how because

593
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,400
you mentioned the banks let me also

594
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,240
explain how banks work and it's a little

595
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,640
bit technical but we have different

596
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880
banks that do different things um and

597
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,400
the core object of the bank and these

598
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,640
are extremely important technology is to

599
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,360
prevent the re-sharing of dangerous

600
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,279
content shared by this is referring to

601
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,440
the media banks that your automated

602
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
systems would be using when you're

603
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,480
talking about banks

604
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,799
exactly exactly and and we have

605
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,640
different banks as i said

606
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,200
one of them is actually directly related

607
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,000
to

608
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,039
core

609
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,000
violence and site mentor that shared by

610
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,640
terrorists and hate organizations and we

611
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,679
prevent the reshare on or of that type

612
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:33,760
of content in all circumstances like

613
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,799
perpetrator generated content of an

614
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:38,480
actual terrorist activity or mass

615
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,880
shooting however we have other banks

616
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,200
that triage content that's

617
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,200
labeled by the automation to human

618
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,159
reviewer to assess whether the caption

619
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,039
is supportive of the organization on its

620
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:52,960
activity or actually neutrally

621
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,360
discussing it

622
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,760
and here

623
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,880
so and here comes the new ones um it's

624
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,279
it's sometimes this is an adversarial

625
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,919
environment and we always try to err on

626
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,480
the side of safety and to ensure that

627
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,039
our platform is safe from terrorist

628
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,679
activity and and hateful organizations

629
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,159
propaganda i don't i don't discount the

630
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,320
fact that this is a very difficult um

631
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,039
issue to tackle but i think the

632
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,760
the amount of mistakes we've seen has

633
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,520
like raised a lot of concerns and i

634
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:28,879
would love rana to jump in

635
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,960
sorry i don't want to move away from the

636
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,360
topic we're talking about but um

637
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
what i struggle with is the actual

638
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,720
process where there's a feeling that

639
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,679
there's no transparency as how

640
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
meta decides what to keep on these

641
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:44,240
platforms and what to remove would you

642
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,480
mind just telling us when

643
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,200
um a user posts a a content what happens

644
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,559
so is it an automated removal or is an

645
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:56,880
individual sits there and looks at them

646
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,200
can you explain that please

647
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,080
sure so what happens is that we have a

648
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,640
mix of technology and human reviewers

649
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,120
also automation and human reviewers and

650
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,039
content come to our knowledge either if

651
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:13,039
reported by a user or if our automation

652
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,840
flags it to a human reviewer

653
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,640
in both situations the content is tested

654
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,880
and assessed against our community

655
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,919
standards

656
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,480
and if it was violating

657
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,760
we remove it

658
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:29,279
and we send notification to our to the

659
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:30,159
user

660
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,000
specifying that the content has been by

661
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,760
removed and to give them also an

662
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,880
opportunity for appeal so the user who

663
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,760
face

664
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,159
content removal can appeal our decision

665
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,120
and then this appeal is reviewed

666
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,240
and if

667
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,080
the violation stands or the assessment

668
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,120
stands it the content will remain down

669
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,520
and if not we will restore it

670
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,080
so this is simply the process we are

671
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,799
trying to improve the transparency and

672
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,440
we know that we didn't do enough we

673
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,760
still need to do more on transparency

674
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,159
and we have many things in place so the

675
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,799
appeals the notifications but also most

676
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,000
recently we created the account status

677
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:10,720
in

678
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,960
in in instagram which you can get to

679
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,880
through the settings button

680
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,279
and it tells you everything

681
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,600
that happened on the on the accounts and

682
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
to what extent did we engage with it did

683
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,200
we remove any content is there any

684
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,679
feature limits and the user can actually

685
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,080
appeal any of these decisions

686
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,120
to us and we can review and correct if

687
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,200
if any mistake was taken okay so there

688
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,600
are two levels one is the automated

689
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,320
system one is human reviewer would the

690
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:41,120
automated system automatically remove

691
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:43,440
content because it has been mass

692
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,960
reported because we have cases uh that

693
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,799
content has been removed

694
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:51,360
rather very quickly after they're posted

695
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,039
um and when you look at it there's

696
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:54,720
nothing wrong with with that is that the

697
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,480
machine making that decision or an

698
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:57,600
individual

699
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,200
it can be it can be actually one of

700
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,760
three things and i understand that here

701
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,760
is as an area that we are also need to

702
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,000
do to do more in terms of transparency

703
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,480
it can be a human judgment error yes

704
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,520
sometimes although we train uh reviewers

705
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,880
we audit on weekly basis many of their

706
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,799
decisions to make sure that there is

707
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,279
that there's accurate and unbiased

708
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,760
approach towards content review

709
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,320
but mistakes happen and two

710
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,720
it can be an automation error and we

711
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,360
also audit automation enforcement to try

712
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,840
to correct that but also sometimes it's

713
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,640
bugs and technical glitches that cause

714
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
um content content removal although

715
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,000
without a specific violation to our

716
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,159
policies and i know sometimes this is

717
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:45,120
hard to believe um with a big tech

718
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,679
company to have tech to have technical

719
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,840
glitches but this is a fact any tech

720
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,240
company would fall into that and may and

721
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,919
i know the frustration there because

722
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,840
sometimes there will be no reason for

723
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
the content to be taken down and i can

724
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,480
give you a few examples if you want

725
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,480
most recently um

726
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,240
bella hadid for instance in in may 15

727
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,399
we had a problem with the way videos um

728
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,520
are spread in in the instagram feeds um

729
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,320
and at the time bella was discussing

730
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,559
several issues related to palestine um

731
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,960
and the issue was technical the content

732
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,000
um

733
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,399
um the document was taken down or less

734
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:25,919
recommended because of the technical

735
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,919
glitch but

736
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
her followers people her fans herself

737
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,840
would potentially perceive that as as um

738
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,080
as us taking the content because of its

739
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,480
substance and that was absolutely not

740
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,440
the case

741
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,520
we only take content down if it

742
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,760
validates the policy but we are an

743
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,279
additional import extremely important

744
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:47,279
point that we are doing now to increase

745
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,520
transparency around these circumstances

746
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:51,919
is that we are testing a notification

747
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:54,159
system currently in the us i'm confident

748
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:56,320
hopeful as well that we can roll that

749
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,279
out widely that tells people when their

750
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,200
account was hit by a technical bug or um

751
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,080
um you know a technological glitch so

752
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
that people know why their content was

753
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,360
taken down and also to give us to get

754
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,600
more transparency on the reasons any

755
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,679
action has been taken on their accounts

756
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,440
so i mean i think this is really

757
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,600
important to talk about because

758
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,279
i think the um perception or the

759
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,679
conspiracy theories that run rampant

760
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:26,559
about

761
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:27,679
why

762
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,960
um meta is getting so much wrong when it

763
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,120
comes to persian content and of course

764
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,200
like you said

765
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:37,360
the same issues have been ongoing in

766
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,760
arabic there's been a massive movement

767
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,000
for transparency and accountability on

768
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,880
how

769
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,080
content about palestine um is being

770
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
moderated by meta and i know we're

771
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,600
waiting for the business for social

772
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,799
responsibilities audits of the processes

773
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,760
meta uses for palestine takedown but um

774
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:58,000
i mean i really want rana to touch on

775
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,080
this as well which is just

776
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:00,880
the

777
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,440
the feeling or perceptions within

778
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:06,159
um the persian community about the

779
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,080
moderations and the conspiracies which

780
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,559
you know are actually founded on actual

781
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:14,000
events so rana please give us some um

782
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,679
yes i'm glad that we

783
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,399
eventually got here because i understand

784
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,320
the argument about terrorist

785
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,720
organizations or dangerous organizations

786
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:24,720
and individuals have an incitement of

787
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,720
violence that's a very difficult topic

788
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,039
and i understand all the challenges

789
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,240
facing that

790
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,640
but one of the reasons that the persian

791
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,159
community

792
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:34,880
is

793
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,880
getting more and more suspicious slash

794
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:40,480
frustrated is because mistakes keep

795
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,360
being repeated so a mistake can happen

796
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,840
once a mistake can happen twice but when

797
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,120
you see that

798
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,440
every other week every other month we

799
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,559
have content that is criticizing the

800
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:54,799
iranian government removed from meta

801
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,760
platforms then that really fuels

802
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,919
conspiracy theories

803
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,039
about what is happening behind the scene

804
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,519
to give you an example january

805
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:09,039
7th 2022 was the anniversary of the

806
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:12,880
downing of a passenger airplane ps752

807
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
by the iranian revolutionary gods

808
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,760
that the family the association of the

809
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,159
family members were trying to start a

810
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:22,000
campaign about

811
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,880
their call for justice about that

812
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,200
incident and they had a hashtag i will

813
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,120
light a candle too

814
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,720
and to everybody's shock and horror

815
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,679
on the day we found out that hashtag was

816
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:37,919
blocked by instagram

817
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
um then obviously there was an outcry

818
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,399
and metal responded and they said it was

819
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:44,960
a mistake but frankly until today i

820
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,200
can't understand how a mistake like that

821
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,720
can happen

822
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,399
and more importantly i want to know

823
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,559
whether these kind of mistakes are being

824
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:55,679
investigated internally because if

825
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:58,159
mistake after mistake is happening in

826
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:01,519
favor of the islamic republic

827
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,360
i think that the persian community and

828
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,240
the civil society would like to know why

829
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,919
and is meta

830
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,840
seriously looking into these incidents

831
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,360
because these are

832
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,519
serious issues for persian speakers who

833
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:15,760
are using your platform

834
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,960
yeah so i i totally understand

835
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,799
that when a piece of content is taken

836
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,480
down especially even if repeated times

837
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,320
and sometimes without a clear

838
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,399
justification that would

839
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,799
lead people um towards making their own

840
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,200
conclusions i don't understand that but

841
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,519
what i want to stress and i'll answer

842
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,600
specifically to the to the cases that

843
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,760
you you raised rana is that there is

844
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,360
only good intentions in the teams and

845
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,760
the people working behind the scenes to

846
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,080
set the policies and to enforce them and

847
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,200
we take every push error every

848
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,880
inaccuracy and enforcement very

849
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,679
seriously and we try to correct them to

850
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,440
learn from them and to try to improve

851
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:59,760
whether this was a policy gap or an

852
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,080
enforcement error and then try to cover

853
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:05,039
that and not to repeat it again and let

854
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:07,200
me be specific and target quickly the

855
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,359
point you mentioned regarding hashtag i

856
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,239
would like to candle so the hashtag

857
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,960
does not violate our policies

858
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,839
and

859
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:17,839
it was the substance of the content

860
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,280
sharing with it shared with it was

861
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:21,679
actually also not violating the policies

862
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,599
however it was

863
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,159
blocked temporarily because there was

864
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,480
many content shared not necessarily

865
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,159
linked to the main message of the

866
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:32,159
hashtag that violated our policies

867
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,079
specifically the dangerous organizations

868
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,639
and individuals policy and that record

869
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,239
triggered in the system

870
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,960
you know we block hashtags when they are

871
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,918
when they have a certain percentage of

872
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,320
violating content and let me be clear

873
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,159
blocking a hashtag does not mean taking

874
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,918
the content down we don't remove the

875
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:51,440
content when you block the hashtag it

876
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,918
just makes the hashtag unsocial

877
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:54,879
so

878
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,599
we we the systems did that automatically

879
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,720
because of

880
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:02,240
the violations um of the ui policy um

881
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,240
associated with the hashtag but then

882
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,320
when we learned about this action and we

883
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,359
assessed

884
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,800
that type of content we found that the

885
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,000
violating content is not actually

886
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,640
connected to the message or the actual

887
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,400
purpose of the hashtag

888
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,960
so we took down the violating content we

889
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,760
restored the access to the hashtag and

890
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,359
none of the content that was shared that

891
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,040
had the hashtag was taken down if it

892
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,720
wasn't violating

893
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,280
so this is to to to be absolutely clear

894
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,280
about that but it's important to know

895
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
that we value

896
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,680
that the iranian community is using

897
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,880
instagram

898
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,680
and

899
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,400
we have seen even in the last month

900
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,280
hundreds of thousands of engagements

901
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,200
around the protests in reels stories

902
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:50,240
um posts instagram from all over the

903
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,079
country and

904
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,560
that you know is a message that we have

905
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,880
that mandate there and we want to make

906
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,160
sure that the

907
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:01,200
iranian users have that access to

908
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,839
instagram and to use it at a civic space

909
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,240
as well

910
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:08,160
um thank you so much so you mean that

911
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,920
the hashtag was being abused by other

912
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,240
people and that's why your it was

913
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,440
flagged

914
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:16,240
so the hash many people who potentially

915
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,480
would have you know counter narratives

916
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,880
to the main one related to the hashtag

917
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,880
was sharing content and that content was

918
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,520
potentially violating for that ui policy

919
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:26,960
and that triggered the automatic the

920
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,960
automatic you know

921
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,440
so like the islamic republic of iran

922
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:33,520
which is well known for having you know

923
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,839
propaganda campaigns and you know troll

924
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:38,240
armies if they potentially wanted to

925
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,400
populate that hashtag with problematic

926
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,920
content they could have abused this rule

927
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,000
to take down this hashtag

928
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,040
no

929
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,440
what i'm saying is that there was

930
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,800
you know people who were sharing

931
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,720
content counter narrative to the main

932
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,720
message of the hashtag and we have

933
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:59,599
systems in place to to face coordinated

934
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,839
and authentic behavior and to take down

935
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,160
networks when we have evidence of them

936
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,520
but in this circumstances we um

937
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,599
we restored immediately the hashtag once

938
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:11,440
we knew that the violating content was

939
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,280
not actually linked to the main message

940
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,560
of the hashtag

941
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,800
so there was no reason and we acted fast

942
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,960
on that once we learned about that about

943
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,880
about that that's because they had the

944
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,280
media behind them

945
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,520
where i worry is that similar cases

946
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,440
happen and they don't have that media

947
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,599
power behind them and and that's why

948
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,079
rana one of like meetings like the one

949
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:34,480
we are having now and many engagements

950
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:36,079
with the members of the community civil

951
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,240
society and academia is extremely

952
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,000
important for us to get this feedback

953
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,400
because we learn about it when we talk

954
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,400
more about it and when we talk to you to

955
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,960
talk to activists and experts and and

956
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,960
this is an example of them and we are

957
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:50,960
keen to have more about that we have

958
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,640
done that and it's important also to

959
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:54,640
flag something that our policies are

960
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,119
done based on an extremely consultative

961
00:37:57,119 --> 00:37:59,440
and iterative process and we engage with

962
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,280
experts and civil society from all over

963
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
the world before we decide that a piece

964
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,359
of content should be taken down based on

965
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,160
a policy we engage with

966
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:09,760
you know everyone because we know that

967
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:11,760
we we don't own the truth we don't know

968
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,200
everything and so we built an extremely

969
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,200
consultative process that engaged

970
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,119
stakeholders inside the company from

971
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:20,720
different perspectives and outside the

972
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:23,440
company from different um you know

973
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
backgrounds to make sure that the

974
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,480
diverse opinions are fed into the policy

975
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:29,920
development process

976
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,320
so i mean before we leave this topic and

977
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,359
i saw someone from the audience um uh

978
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:36,800
asked the same question which i just

979
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,160
asked which is the potential for

980
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,640
manipulation which i think we've um

981
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,040
addressed but before we leave this topic

982
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:45,520
i i think it would i would be remiss not

983
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,720
to mention

984
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,680
the bbc persian report done by rana's

985
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,680
colleague parham

986
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,200
um

987
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:54,960
about

988
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,440
the center in essen

989
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:00,880
so this bbc report i mean i don't think

990
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:04,240
there was any smoking gun but the there

991
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,400
has been a lot of concern over

992
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,240
um you know the potential for the

993
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:12,000
islamic republic of iran to be able to

994
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,960
you know bribe or infiltrate these

995
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,920
content moderators that are hosted in

996
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,880
this contracted center in sn germany and

997
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,839
i know

998
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:26,079
in reaction uh meta has said and i

999
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:27,040
rana

1000
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,800
how to phrase this better but i think

1001
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,320
the response was that there was going to

1002
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
be a investigation into that center in

1003
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,520
essen i would you know rana um before

1004
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,440
muhammad goes i would love for your two

1005
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,960
cents on this topic and then to get

1006
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,839
muhammad's reaction yes i'm glad uh we

1007
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,440
we're here now so

1008
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,280
the automation we talked about and now

1009
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,760
we're talking about um human reviewers

1010
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,720
and as we know uh many of these human uh

1011
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,359
reviewers on are on very low salaries

1012
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:56,240
and uh we know that iran allegedly has

1013
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,480
offered uh something between five to ten

1014
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,200
thousand dollars uh to have those people

1015
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,839
who are in charge of reviewing uh

1016
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,800
persian content uh to shut down certain

1017
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,800
accounts like massive nazareth iran one

1018
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,640
of iran's most famous

1019
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,560
political activists

1020
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,440
um so i would like to know um whether

1021
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:17,680
there is a vetting process

1022
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,319
and what exactly happens in essen and

1023
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:22,160
how can you make sure that these people

1024
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,640
are not groomed by the islamic republic

1025
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,720
in order to serve

1026
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,119
their agenda

1027
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:31,119
of course i'm equally happy that you

1028
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,599
raised this issue masa and rana

1029
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,200
and i think it's a good opportunity for

1030
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,920
us being here to talk about it

1031
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,599
and we take these

1032
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,839
investigations and claims extremely

1033
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,599
seriously

1034
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:45,839
and i can assure to you

1035
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,000
that there is absolutely no connection

1036
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,920
or affiliation between toulouse

1037
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,000
international our outsourcing essence in

1038
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,359
germany

1039
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,720
and the iranian regime um we have apps

1040
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,640
find absolutely no officially mohammed

1041
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:00,560
but how do you know that the staff there

1042
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,760
are not manipulated so there is a system

1043
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:06,000
in place and let me actually elaborate

1044
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,760
that so one

1045
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,680
the representative or the reviewer

1046
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,760
cannot know which type of content or

1047
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,680
which content they will review because

1048
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,240
jobs is assigned to them

1049
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,520
you know randomly and we have clear

1050
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,160
policies written in clear language with

1051
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,240
the objective that if two people would

1052
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,680
make a decision around a piece of

1053
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,160
content would make the same decision

1054
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,720
so we don't leave room for subjectivity

1055
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,119
or bias for our viewers

1056
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
and we conduct weekly audits

1057
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:37,760
random audits of

1058
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,040
samples from the content that the

1059
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,960
reviewers do

1060
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,400
review and we assess the accuracy and we

1061
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,800
correct and train them further if there

1062
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:49,200
is any um inaccuracy or something

1063
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,800
substantial that we need to to to

1064
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,359
understand and we provide trainings when

1065
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,280
they are onboarded including trainers on

1066
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,440
bias and everything but we also provide

1067
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,599
follow-up trainings to make sure that

1068
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,520
they are aware of policy updates and

1069
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,880
policy new ones

1070
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,119
and there is also some issues that were

1071
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:08,400
raised in the in the in the article that

1072
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,240
suggested few stuff which i would like

1073
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,800
to highlight like for instance that a

1074
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,680
representative can go to the locker

1075
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:18,240
report a piece of content from his phone

1076
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:20,240
or their phone and come back to the room

1077
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,319
and then action the content this is just

1078
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,880
not possible because it assumes that the

1079
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:26,560
reviewer knows which which content will

1080
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,079
come to their queue and that doesn't

1081
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:31,280
happen it goes randomly and also

1082
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,119
some of that claims that uh we only

1083
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,520
review 10 percent or we order 10 percent

1084
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,520
and hence the reviewers have full

1085
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,920
liberty to take bias decisions in the

1086
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,680
remaining 90

1087
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:45,200
that's also not true because we the the

1088
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,599
the actual auditing happens on a random

1089
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,599
sample statistically random sample that

1090
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,319
they can't predict the rep will not know

1091
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,720
which content are we going to audit so

1092
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
we take these acquisitions and and

1093
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,240
claims extremely seriously and we

1094
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,119
have conducted specifically for um for

1095
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,920
that for that um for that claim

1096
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,480
another accuracy assessment and we an

1097
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:11,839
audit and we found that to lose

1098
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:14,880
rate is actually very good and it's

1099
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:15,760
actually

1100
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,400
similar to the rest oversight uh so

1101
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,480
there is review outsourced

1102
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:22,240
offices around the world

1103
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,319
and we find absolutely no evidence of

1104
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,240
that bias so it is worrying because

1105
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,000
that's not the feeling of the persian

1106
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,960
users of of meta because we

1107
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:32,800
there's not that feeling that there is

1108
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,000
accuracy in uh content moderation

1109
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,599
especially in the last couple of weeks

1110
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,599
there were protests in south of iran in

1111
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,280
abu dhabi even

1112
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,440
at news channel like iran international

1113
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,839
their content was being removed

1114
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,720
so that that is why these conspiracy

1115
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,720
theories are rampant as masa says

1116
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,200
because you say you are auditing the

1117
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,599
content but our experience from this

1118
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,520
side of the spectrum is quite different

1119
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,359
from what you say

1120
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:02,000
so it's important to to also recognize

1121
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,760
the scale runner

1122
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,800
in which we we operate if we are we are

1123
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,800
operating on a scale of almost three

1124
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,920
billion users if we get it 99

1125
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,400
right and only one percent wrong that's

1126
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:17,440
a huge chunk and i wouldn't justify even

1127
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,160
the 191 percent would not be justifiable

1128
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,560
under any circumstances so we want to do

1129
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:24,880
more on improving accuracy and

1130
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,280
transparency when action is taken this

1131
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,200
is something that's top of our mind top

1132
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,520
of our agenda and many teams are working

1133
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,560
on that

1134
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,359
but it's also important to to to also

1135
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:38,560
say to our audience from iran and the

1136
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:41,040
wider communities that there is

1137
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:42,560
absolutely

1138
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,280
no bad intention only good intentions

1139
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:47,359
are within the company for all our

1140
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,920
communities and also let's know that

1141
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,319
instagram is actually being used so

1142
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:55,280
widely in political and social discourse

1143
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,760
um and it is a working to a lot to a

1144
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:01,280
very very high extent um so we need to

1145
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,599
we need to get that absolutely solid and

1146
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:05,119
then there's not a doubt

1147
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,839
so what mohammed when did these

1148
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,720
human reviewers make these mistakes uh

1149
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,640
is there a process to go back and find

1150
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,680
which individual has done has done it

1151
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:16,560
um

1152
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:17,280
i

1153
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,200
i'm not sure i can get back to you on

1154
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,440
that i can i can learn more about that

1155
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,400
but we but it's important to know that

1156
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,960
if we find that error or if we find

1157
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,440
systemic inaccuracy everyone will be

1158
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,440
subject to an additional training and

1159
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,160
review so it's not we we won't target

1160
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,520
but it's more than just training

1161
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:38,480
muhammad this is this is now serving

1162
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:42,000
the islamic republic's political message

1163
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,760
and agenda so if

1164
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,599
an individual is

1165
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,400
working to serve the islamic republic of

1166
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,880
iran then the users would like to know

1167
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:53,040
because this is not just about what is

1168
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,440
published this is now about the privacy

1169
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,760
of users if these people have access to

1170
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,400
private information and direct messages

1171
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,720
that can be very worrying for uh persian

1172
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,040
speakers right so it's important to know

1173
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,760
that the the reviewers only can see the

1174
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,920
content and they can only judge based on

1175
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:11,599
the face value okay that's one thing

1176
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:15,040
they can't access personal information

1177
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,520
of of of the users and it's also again

1178
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,280
the mediterranean

1179
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:21,119
everyone needs to know that

1180
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:22,480
the accuracy level in toulouse

1181
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,359
international is really high and we have

1182
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:28,720
audited that and also that the random

1183
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,800
order that happens every week sorry

1184
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:32,480
muhammad just to interrupt you i'm

1185
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,400
wondering if there's any mechanism or

1186
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,480
any plans by meta to be able to make

1187
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:38,800
those audits public because you know

1188
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,800
from the very little data collection

1189
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,240
we've done to try to outreach with

1190
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,800
persian users i mean for just one week

1191
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,880
we tried to get to document the

1192
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,960
takedowns and we had i think in the span

1193
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:50,720
of like two or three days we just we had

1194
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,400
200 and that was just the networks

1195
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,880
article 19 was able to reach out to

1196
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,800
and i think there's a disconnect between

1197
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:58,960
iranians actually finding the processes

1198
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,760
to make their reports they don't always

1199
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
know how to do it technically within so

1200
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:06,240
i don't always think that you have the

1201
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,920
mechanism to have direct access into the

1202
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:11,280
mistakes that are happening in the

1203
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,560
persian community because i think

1204
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,720
between rana and i and others in the

1205
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,880
community there's like thousands of

1206
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:18,960
cases that just don't get reported and

1207
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,040
probably don't get into your data so i

1208
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,480
think it would be really important to

1209
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,359
just have a little bit of more robust um

1210
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,280
investigations into exactly what's

1211
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,599
happening because you know it we might

1212
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:31,240
be wrong what we're seeing might be

1213
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,160
0.001 percent but it does seem to be

1214
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:37,839
having a massive impact um and moving

1215
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,960
towards that kind of um yeah

1216
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,760
ability to have uh that transparency or

1217
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,280
investigation would be really great and

1218
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:46,800
i know you can't give me that promise

1219
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,720
right now so i'll

1220
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,280
i'll change that i'll change the

1221
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,960
the topic really quickly because i know

1222
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:56,000
we're gonna hit the end mark of our uh

1223
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,200
discussion

1224
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:01,359
um uh actually can i just um

1225
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,520
someone has a question actually from

1226
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:07,280
inside iran from a non-profit um

1227
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,559
saying that

1228
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,880
they work in civic education in iran and

1229
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,359
their content is being taken down

1230
00:48:13,359 --> 00:48:16,240
due to violations of community standards

1231
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:18,160
how can we solve this issue on an

1232
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:20,880
organizational level not on a post by

1233
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,960
post basis what is the procedure and i

1234
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:24,240
think that kind of speaks to the fact

1235
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,079
that no one really knows or maybe

1236
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:27,760
doesn't necessarily have access to the

1237
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,280
policies to know what they're doing

1238
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,839
wrong um

1239
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:34,480
but the policies are public we have

1240
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,520
since 2018 our policies are public the

1241
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,440
community standards is available and

1242
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:41,520
it's available in the farsi language so

1243
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:44,160
i encourage everyone to actually visit

1244
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,079
our transparency center which is rich of

1245
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,839
many information including what you were

1246
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,280
talking about

1247
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,280
we we share information about our

1248
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,359
enforcement uh we shared information

1249
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,920
about our the proactive as well as user

1250
00:48:55,920 --> 00:48:57,920
reporting enforcement and also

1251
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,000
government take down requests speaking

1252
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,079
of the the point julie uh highlighted

1253
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,319
earlier so there's a lot of information

1254
00:49:04,319 --> 00:49:06,720
shared publicly that the user can access

1255
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:08,640
and understand more about yeah

1256
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,800
um so we have 10 minutes left so i'm

1257
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,040
going to open up this one topic that's

1258
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:14,720
quite big so i'm going to open up the

1259
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,720
topic of protest um which i know

1260
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,640
muhammad you probably have a lot to say

1261
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,680
about because i i know you um you know

1262
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:22,720
you've

1263
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:24,240
uh you've

1264
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,559
you follow protests and obviously rana

1265
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:28,079
as a journalist

1266
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:31,359
um i think for you it's incredibly

1267
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:33,599
important how you know citizen

1268
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,160
journalists or ordinary iranians on the

1269
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,000
ground in iran

1270
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,920
document things like protests and the

1271
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,920
human rights violations that occur or

1272
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,400
just the newsworthy worthy things that

1273
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:47,760
occur and they're posted um

1274
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,200
on instagram especially instagram um so

1275
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:52,720
i mean

1276
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,280
bbc has been in touch and interviewed

1277
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:56,240
them

1278
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,240
i've been following the work and have

1279
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,559
been following the role of one of these

1280
00:50:00,559 --> 00:50:02,960
protest collectives 1500 test sphere

1281
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,880
that has been operating all across iran

1282
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:07,119
to get a lot of this documentation and

1283
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:08,720
so

1284
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:11,280
um i mean i think in recent days they

1285
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,040
haven't been having a lot of takedowns

1286
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:14,960
because they're they have learned to

1287
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,920
self-censor which i'm not sure is a good

1288
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:18,720
thing

1289
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:20,000
um but

1290
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,680
and this was a thing that you know we

1291
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,839
saw happening with news organizations

1292
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,240
countless iranian users which was

1293
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:31,200
protest footage that contained just um

1294
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,800
any or mag by rayci or magbear passage

1295
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:37,040
any of these other you know fill-ins for

1296
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:39,040
death to the dictator specialized at

1297
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:42,160
your own what's getting taken down um

1298
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,400
first of all i would love rana to speak

1299
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,960
about you know the the need to have this

1300
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,720
documentation despite the fact that you

1301
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,280
know i i don't think any of us

1302
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:54,079
like like to wish death upon anyone but

1303
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,079
this is just the nature and fact of

1304
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:59,200
protests um yeah rana just tell me a

1305
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,880
little bit about documenting and

1306
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,200
following protests using social media

1307
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:05,520
muhammad as an egyptian who remembers

1308
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:07,920
the the revolution in egypt you you're

1309
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,839
aware of the nature of these protests

1310
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:11,119
and i understand that a lot of the

1311
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:14,240
policies that are written by meta uh is

1312
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,839
for for the american society and

1313
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,240
american politics but the nature of a

1314
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:20,559
lot that is happening in a theocracy

1315
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,880
like iran is it's very different and my

1316
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:24,800
worry is that a lot of the content is

1317
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,359
being treated as if they are happening

1318
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,400
in a democracy um and as a result the

1319
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,240
flow of information outside the country

1320
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,200
which we heavily rely on uh is now

1321
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,839
censored because uh as i said earlier

1322
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,760
that's our sometimes that's our only

1323
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:41,440
window inside the country and if that

1324
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,040
those contents are being removed it

1325
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,640
means that the

1326
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,920
information flow is disrupted so um i

1327
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,760
wonder whether there's a solution or

1328
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:52,480
whether it always have to be a case by

1329
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,440
case and civil society going to meta and

1330
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,000
explaining the situation or whether

1331
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,760
there could be a blanket

1332
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,079
rule for each country based on their

1333
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,200
political situation

1334
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,559
thank you so much rana this is an

1335
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,480
extremely important issue

1336
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,160
and let me start

1337
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,760
with the point that

1338
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,000
our community standards and our policy

1339
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:16,960
is designed for our entire community of

1340
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:19,440
users and ninety percent of them almost

1341
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,119
ninety percent percent of them is

1342
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,079
outside north america so we developed

1343
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:25,440
these policies

1344
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:28,400
with this fact in mind and our team that

1345
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,040
i belong to is actually extremely

1346
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,200
international very diverse and located

1347
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,760
around 13 offices around the world so we

1348
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,280
don't design these policies only for the

1349
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:42,240
users in north america at all and we

1350
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,040
don't only consult with activists and

1351
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,960
and think tanks and

1352
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:49,280
civil society there we consult with a

1353
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:51,920
diverse background of civil society and

1354
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:54,160
activists and human rights organizations

1355
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
from all over the world um so that's

1356
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,880
important to flag um and having said

1357
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,280
that we are still keen all the time to

1358
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:03,359
continue to engage in conversations

1359
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:07,040
around our policies and to ensure that

1360
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:09,280
this is a global policy and that the

1361
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,160
global policies of as tomorrow as

1362
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:14,480
to as large extent as possible is also

1363
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,359
meeting the new ones um right that

1364
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:19,760
expected in different contexts um so

1365
00:53:19,760 --> 00:53:21,520
this is this is something that we that

1366
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,960
we care to to to to achieve um and if

1367
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,440
you want me to specifically

1368
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,040
but yeah let's specifically address

1369
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,720
because we have we're so short on time

1370
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,880
so death to common a um it's been well

1371
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,040
documented that this exception was given

1372
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,680
before um we saw the exception given um

1373
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,559
in july 2021 it was documented uh in a

1374
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:43,920
vice article and there is a precedent

1375
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,760
for exceptions in fact you know there

1376
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:47,200
were a number of exceptions given for

1377
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,520
the ukraine war and i know muhammad you

1378
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,440
say you respect the oversight board a

1379
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,920
lot but the oversight board even had a

1380
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:56,480
reaction to the fact that meta has asked

1381
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,319
the oversight board not to deliberate on

1382
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:01,119
any cases related to ukraine and russia

1383
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,559
um and i think in their statement they

1384
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,240
said they were disappointed that meta is

1385
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,200
not allowing um then to deliberate on

1386
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:08,960
those cases which i assume would also

1387
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,119
include some of the the exceptions and

1388
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:12,960
it's it's such a shame that you know

1389
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,720
julie and the oversight board can't he

1390
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,640
come here and talk about you know

1391
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:19,680
creating i guess consistent

1392
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:22,319
contextual policies like you know we

1393
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,880
look at how protests emerge in iran and

1394
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,400
we don't think protests are ever going

1395
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,880
to stop in iran anytime soon but you

1396
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:31,520
know magbomine as long as he's alive is

1397
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:33,599
probably going to be part and parcel of

1398
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,440
protests and therefore part of protest

1399
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:38,319
footage and protest content um so how do

1400
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,480
we come to terms with the fact that we

1401
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,920
should not be um censoring protests and

1402
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:45,920
it's you know and often like rana knows

1403
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:47,440
this as well you have citizen

1404
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,359
journalists posting this documentation

1405
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:51,920
for purposes of news and meta is

1406
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,920
removing it

1407
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:56,319
so these are these are many issues

1408
00:54:56,319 --> 00:54:58,079
and i think i would take from them too

1409
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,880
specifically like to directly address

1410
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,520
your concern about this death to

1411
00:55:03,520 --> 00:55:05,760
hashtags or content and then use

1412
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:08,559
reporting and when it comes to death to

1413
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:11,599
um our violence and incitement policy um

1414
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,599
is you know designed to prevent offline

1415
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,839
harm at events to prevent the incitement

1416
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:17,920
of violence on our platform and also

1417
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:21,520
that includes preventing calls for death

1418
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,720
to anyone including journalists

1419
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,960
activists and heads of states um and and

1420
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,839
you know to your point earlier rana

1421
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:34,000
we we feel like when we think as a

1422
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:35,520
private company that it's not

1423
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:38,480
appropriate that we make value judgments

1424
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,599
around

1425
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:41,359
what's a democracy and what's not and

1426
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:42,799
and and when

1427
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,760
is it allowed for somebody to say this

1428
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,680
to an individual because we don't know

1429
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,640
100 the intention behind everyone who is

1430
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:53,359
sharing that type of content so having

1431
00:55:53,359 --> 00:55:56,160
said that um we disallow that type of

1432
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,200
content and however we still

1433
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,319
allow

1434
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:03,119
discussions around it or news reporting

1435
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:06,160
so entities that cover um the events in

1436
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,240
iran are you know that's this definitely

1437
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
content that's that's allowed um even if

1438
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,240
it covers you know the protest and the

1439
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,400
creeds and everything that's being said

1440
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,960
this is something that we we allow on

1441
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:20,319
our platform either used by um um you

1442
00:56:20,319 --> 00:56:22,799
know an authentic news entity or

1443
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,200
independent journalists and and and

1444
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,200
citizen journalists uh these are things

1445
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,559
that that we definitely allow but it's

1446
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,400
important to flag that

1447
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,000
there's a lot of

1448
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,720
content and discourse that's sharing our

1449
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:36,559
platform discussing the protests and

1450
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,160
people's demands

1451
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,480
already on meta on instagram and we're

1452
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,160
very proud that instagram is giving

1453
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:44,799
people that opportunity

1454
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,040
so are we so finally as you mentioned

1455
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,559
news the

1456
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:50,640
news stations as i said even content

1457
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,079
from iran international was being

1458
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:55,680
removed and um our other um panelists

1459
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:58,160
who uh failed to join us today

1460
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,839
his content has also been removed and

1461
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:02,079
what i find bizarre it's not always

1462
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,559
protest it's not always death too but as

1463
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:07,680
someone who who's um by far iran's most

1464
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:09,920
famous political sataris his content is

1465
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,079
constantly being reported and removed

1466
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:14,240
which i find weird because he's a

1467
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,200
verified user he he has worked for

1468
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,880
prestigious news channels and tv

1469
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,480
organizations so he knows a lot of

1470
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:22,480
editorial guidelines and he abides by

1471
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,359
them and he's probably iran's jimmy

1472
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:27,680
fallon or trevor noah and i wonder

1473
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:31,520
whether meta ever removes their content

1474
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,760
does something similar happen to them

1475
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:35,839
when their content is constantly and his

1476
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:37,760
content is political satire i know that

1477
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:40,480
method says satire is very complicated

1478
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,280
but

1479
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:43,680
he when someone is uh it's followed by

1480
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,119
over seven million people and is

1481
00:57:45,119 --> 00:57:48,799
verified why are his uh uh content being

1482
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,079
removed

1483
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,319
so on on the specifically the case of

1484
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,599
cena because we have been in

1485
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:55,520
conversation with him and we reviewed

1486
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,760
his account and we found

1487
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:00,640
no removal of content for the last year

1488
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,359
at the very least um so we are now in

1489
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:05,200
conversation to understand whether there

1490
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:07,359
was some technical issues at this end

1491
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:09,200
while uploading content

1492
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:11,440
and i'm pleased to see

1493
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:15,040
cena sharing a lot of his content videos

1494
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
discussing in his

1495
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:20,480
satirical approach the situation in iran

1496
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,799
but our records show that

1497
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:25,280
like for policy violations or even error

1498
00:58:25,280 --> 00:58:27,440
with that the last one was yesterday

1499
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:31,640
i'm sure he will send you but uh

1500
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:35,440
yesterday removed yes

1501
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,640
what we can do

1502
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,520
yeah absolutely

1503
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:41,839
mass are your music i think you're muted

1504
00:58:41,839 --> 00:58:42,720
sorry

1505
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:45,200
as we come to conclude this session um

1506
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,040
clearly i don't think we've solved all

1507
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,599
our problems but we've really tried to i

1508
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,839
think hopefully uh

1509
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:53,599
shed some light on policies or

1510
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:56,240
confusions there are um i still think

1511
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,799
there's a lot to be desired from meta to

1512
00:58:58,799 --> 00:59:01,839
still do more to be more transparent to

1513
00:59:01,839 --> 00:59:04,880
put more resources into persian

1514
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,960
muhammad might disagree with me but i

1515
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,400
think if you

1516
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,200
have

1517
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:12,400
insight into the voices of the community

1518
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,160
and i mean we had someone else in the

1519
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,079
audience comment that they were saying

1520
00:59:16,079 --> 00:59:18,640
that every community thinks that meta is

1521
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,319
stacked against them which might just

1522
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:22,079
say that this is a problem of scale and

1523
00:59:22,079 --> 00:59:24,160
that might very well be it but i think

1524
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:25,599
the point we're trying to say is that

1525
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:28,079
this is so important and i know muhammad

1526
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,079
you and your colleagues at meta work

1527
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:33,359
very hard um i'm often in touch with

1528
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:35,440
them so i don't discount the fact that

1529
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:38,400
you guys care um i think it's just we're

1530
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,799
looking for systematic approaches to

1531
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:43,119
solving these problems and ensuring that

1532
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:44,000
you know

1533
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,319
meta continues to be a platform that is

1534
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,640
serving um the iranian people in this

1535
00:59:48,640 --> 00:59:51,520
very uh contested space if you have any

1536
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:54,480
final remarks please uh make them very

1537
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,880
short in a few seconds before we are cut

1538
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:57,599
off

1539
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,440
yeah i'm also going to be

1540
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:01,119
very grateful to you mohammed and your

1541
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,640
time and the fact that you have listened

1542
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,640
to our concerns and i i would add to

1543
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,079
mata's comment that we need more

1544
01:00:06,079 --> 01:00:07,520
transparency

1545
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:09,119
specifically about the investigation in

1546
01:00:09,119 --> 01:00:11,200
telus international and the individuals

1547
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,440
who are allegedly working with the

1548
01:00:13,440 --> 01:00:15,599
iranian government because if you're

1549
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,000
transparent about that investigation

1550
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,720
then the trust from persian speakers

1551
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:22,319
might come back because at the moment

1552
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:23,920
there are serious questions about what's

1553
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,680
going on there thank you

1554
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,040
thank you anna and i i would like to

1555
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,119
reiterate quickly that instagram is a

1556
01:00:29,119 --> 01:00:31,040
place where people are using for their

1557
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,520
voice and to explain and to shed light

1558
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,280
on events on the grounds

1559
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,240
we really care about getting this right

1560
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,480
and we will continue to invest

1561
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:42,720
resources and technologies to improve

1562
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:44,880
that and we understand when things build

1563
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,200
up sometimes they paint a picture that's

1564
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,960
not necessarily accurate i want to

1565
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,960
assure everyone joining us in this

1566
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:53,680
discussion that this is not the case and

1567
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,599
that we hope to improve that and to

1568
01:00:55,599 --> 01:00:57,599
solve all problems needed thank you yeah

1569
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,000
and i hope that there can actually be a

1570
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,720
iran case at the oversight board and um

1571
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,480
yeah thanks to julie for joining and

1572
