1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,680
we need to be working collectively now

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:07,919
uh and that means co-development and

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:10,880
co-design not just consultation uh

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,599
because these issues are upon us but

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,839
looking at what happened in hong kong

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
and thailand there are so many parallels

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,359
that we are learning from each other and

8
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:20,640
trying to develop

9
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,800
things and strategies that actually are

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,320
developed by one another and then we

11
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,080
kind of evolved together and i think

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,680
this kind of support and this kind of

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:29,920
organizational cooperation is like very

14
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,920
important when you think of the law of

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,760
the sea where we have

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,399
limits within 10 miles 12 miles 200

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,680
miles

18
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:40,719
from a given land area and the political

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,879
jurisdiction controls that part of the

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:45,360
ocean and then after that you're in

21
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,239
international waters the question is

22
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,440
how do we

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,840
should we emulate that when we finally

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,800
get into uh outer space when we get to

25
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
the moon when we get to mars when we get

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,399
to the asteroids

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,160
what are the rules

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
believe that you are not alone

29
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,199
uh

30
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,438
democratic countries are with you people

31
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,520
around the world are with you

32
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,520
what really counts is action that makes

33
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,799
a change

34
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,280
action that deals with the problem

35
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,200
none of that is easy but

36
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,479
we're determined to do it and we're

37
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,720
determined to do it together we often

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,640
forget um as writers and as readers

39
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,600
that

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,640
writing

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,920
and literature is our technologies

42
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,720
my name is kai mata i'm indonesian and

43
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,759
i'm also flaming gay

44
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:36,079
no laws will change that no conversion

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,920
therapy will change that and neither

46
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,960
will the hate nor threats just just

47
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,520
listening to you i can

48
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,759
you know i'm taking notes down because

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,680
you know and smiling i mean it's not

50
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,240
it's not funny but i'm smiling because

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,560
of the similarities it's it's all over

52
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,880
the place it's the same thing

53
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,280
ricegum is an important place because

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,079
this is our lollapalooza coachella this

55
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
is our festival this is the place where

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
we can gather together to share skills

57
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,600
knowledge and grow stronger the beauty

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,440
about being a whistleblower is now i

59
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,120
have i'm like a beacon for other

60
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,040
whistleblowers and get to befriend them

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,040
and talk to them about their experience

62
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
this is the world between past and the

63
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,760
future

64
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,319
the past is full of military equipment

65
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,280
clams the tanks and outrageous lies and

66
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
the future is about technology therefore

67
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,879
the new military strategy must include

68
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,280
new digital solutions because the issues

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,360
that rightscon addresses

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
deserve leader level attention because

71
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,200
as i say these are some of the most

72
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,800
important issues that we could be

73
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,959
talking about today we might cut that

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,480
little cliff and send it off to other

75
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
world leaders for

76
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,760
next year's event
