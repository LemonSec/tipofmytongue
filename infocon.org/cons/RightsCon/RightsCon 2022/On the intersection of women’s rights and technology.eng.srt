hi melissa hi brett good to be here

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,280
so let's just actually yes so let's just

28
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,119
start with you um talking a little bit

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,759
about your work

30
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,040
uh so

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,280
my work in activism or my work in cyber

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,080
security mm-hmm a bit of both yeah

33
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,119
probably

34
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,439
i would say yeah

35
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,240
pretty much yes so uh i work in cyber

36
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,000
security and it's a male-dominated

37
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
industry

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
and working in saudi arabia where most

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,920
of the internet is censored heavily by

40
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,640
the government i learned how to bypass

41
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
and you know that was called hacking

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,560
that was in 99

43
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,960
and i think that opened the

44
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,799
world for me to learn that

45
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
even blocked places even censored

46
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,960
spaces with whether virtually or like

47
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,079
physically there are ways to bypass them

48
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,040
i think my career was my training

49
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,680
grounds for being an activist so i

50
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,119
joined the arab spring movement in 2011

51
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,758
by starting the woman to drive movement

52
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:12,000
actually on facebook youtube and twitter

53
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,840
and now i'm completely off all these

54
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,360
social media

55
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
uh because things completely changed in

56
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,760
years later

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,959
yeah that's so

58
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,120
so fascinating actually i was i wanted

59
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,560
to ask you

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,239
about that how

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,959
you know many of the platforms were your

62
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
your allies

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
uh and now

64
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,680
i don't know how you would describe them

65
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:35,440
maybe not your enemies but you know

66
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,280
there's a significant

67
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,280
cost that you've experienced personally

68
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,360
and i think maybe also for the movement

69
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,959
that would be very interesting to hear

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
like how how that changed for you how

71
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,720
your relationship with social media

72
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
changed and perhaps also like what you

73
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,360
see forecasting to the future in terms

74
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
of social media for activism

75
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
good question so you know the arab the

76
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,400
arab youth we use social media to ignite

77
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
revolution and topple dictators

78
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,480
and at that time

79
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,040
they didn't use algorithm to

80
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,080
rate your post so people would join the

81
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,400
social media platform because they

82
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
believed in those courses they wanted to

83
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
follow it they wanted to support it and

84
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,239
it was very organic reach like i

85
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:21,840
remember when i opened my twitter

86
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,840
account after i was released from jail

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,040
for driving while female yeah i had 10

88
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
000 followers

89
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,519
of that night in just one night and when

90
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,680
i posted the video for me driving in the

91
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,400
city of alhuber i had around 700 000

92
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
views in just one day i didn't pay ads

93
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
i didn't ask influencers to push my

94
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,959
videos it was pretty much organic

95
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
because we didn't have

96
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
algorithm at that time right that

97
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,239
chooses what you see on your feet

98
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
fast forward

99
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,959
twitter

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,720
they had a mule

101
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,239
by this

102
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,360
an intern

103
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,959
assad intern

104
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,159
that they became a mule to saudi arabia

105
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,920
who leaked our numbers my number was

106
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
leaked actually because i linked my

107
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,159
twitter account to my australian number

108
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:11,840
and i have a call from the national

109
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,920
security on my australian number and i'm

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,079
like how did they get my number

111
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,320
and then we found out that mule leaked

112
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,279
around 6 000 numbers

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,120
of twitter users most of them are

114
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
anonymous

115
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
been tweeting and criticizing the

116
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,800
government and the conservative

117
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,199
religious establishment in saudi arabia

118
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:32,880
some of them are still in jail until

119
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,240
today so

120
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,560
people who run these

121
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,320
twitter accounts

122
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,479
they found they found out who they are

123
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,639
through their phone numbers yeah because

124
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,600
twitter didn't have a due diligence of

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,000
having not having a flat network with an

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,560
intern have access to all their twitter

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,520
users

128
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,320
and

129
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:54,960
when the fbi went to twitter

130
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,040
they went and they told they told them

131
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,680
the mule that hey if we are after you he

132
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,960
would in the

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,400
he was in the next flight to saudi

134
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,039
arabia and twitter should be really sued

135
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,440
for what happened um i'll mention one

136
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,560
name abdulrahman

137
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,360
used to run a social a twitter account

138
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
and he's in jail today he's sentenced

139
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
for 20 years in jail and 20 years back

140
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,800
and because of his twitter account so

141
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,039
yes i closed my all my social media

142
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,600
accounts because now it's been used the

143
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,680
same tools we used for our liberation

144
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,000
and find our voice it's been used to

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,400
oppress us yeah i mean i think many of

146
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
us have have documented that shift um in

147
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
the way that these tools have worked so

148
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,720
actively i mean we even was called you

149
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,520
know the the twitter arab spring um that

150
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,280
it you know people and wrongly or

151
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,039
rightly there was definitely a sense of

152
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:52,800
liberation really interesting that you

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,560
talk about staff

154
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:56,800
within within some of the tech companies

155
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,639
as well this idea that there was you

156
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,240
know the saudi arabian government had

157
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,800
planted a staff member to be able to

158
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,199
gain access to all of this information

159
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,880
including your phone number and your own

160
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,720
identity and people are in prison as a

161
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:09,759
result

162
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,600
i'm also interested in the kind of

163
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,360
gender elements around this you know

164
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,000
you're obviously such a

165
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:16,960
legend

166
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,440
i want to say in terms of no i mean you

167
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,800
know what you've what you and your

168
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,639
community have done um

169
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,199
um in terms of bringing women's rights

170
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,680
to the fore both within saudi but also

171
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
in the region and and internationally um

172
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,639
how do you think that

173
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,560
the kind of both in the positive sense

174
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,080
but now also perhaps in that negative

175
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,039
sense how social media and technology is

176
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,600
impacting women and particularly

177
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
feminists who are advocating for

178
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,479
political and social change

179
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,560

i'll convey that

188
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,479
please your inspiration

189
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,719
um

190
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,479
social media used effectively to spread

191
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,800
a lot of misinformation

192
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,199
and in saudi arabia it doesn't matter

193
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,000
how well educated you are it doesn't

194
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,240
matter uh um how well traveled and uh

195
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,680
how well you think you are well informed

196
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
social media being used

197
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,720
to

198
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,319
um

199
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,039
propagate or to

200
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,720
the government is using it for the

201
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,039
propaganda in unprecedented way i don't

202
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,280
think governments today dictatorships

203
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,919
and authoritative regime found a tool

204
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
better than social media

205
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,560
to spread their propaganda

206
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,680
and and hybrid target people and show

207
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,919
you a reality completely different than

208
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:01,280
the other person reality

209
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,960
and also use it for surveillance

210
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,039
collecting all this amount of data about

211
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,080
us

212
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,400
um so social media also been used for

213
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
harassment a lot of activists being

214
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
i received death threats rape threats so

215
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,080
much harassment

216
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:16,879
uh

217
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,639
not only the rumors

218
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,720
it's used effectively for character

219
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,160
assassination

220
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
and and terrorizing people when they

221
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,479
speak up when they go online and speak

222
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,560
up and then even the people around you

223
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,639
who you grow up with and they know your

224
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,399
family your close friends they start

225
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,399
questioning you when they

226
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,760
go and read

227
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,159
all this amount of lies

228
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,919
um you know the

229
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,000
the nazis the united states propaganda

230
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,440
is like a lie

231
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,480
told million time becomes reality

232
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,480
becomes the truth and that's what social

233
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,959
media does and unfortunately because of

234
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,399
the engagement

235
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
algorithm that pushes what causes fear

236
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,760
and anger so all these the these are the

237
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
posts and now are the ones are rewarded

238
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
so i don't it really affected human

239
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,040
rights and it really affected the

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,959
getting the truth out and also the

241
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,360
avalanche of information that we get

242
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,880
overwhelms people

243
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,560
so that you don't you don't even have

244
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
time anymore

245
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,880
uh to respond validate yeah to validate

246
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
it yeah and it is interesting melissa

247
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,040
the way in which

248
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,720
you know we've talked a lot this week

249
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,800
about this information about the way in

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,399
which content is propagated within via

251
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
the algorithm on technology platforms

252
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,480
um

253
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,240
and you know this is an instance

254
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,000
obviously that's happening in saudi but

255
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,160
we're seeing replicated all over the

256
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,279
world and and so how unfortunate is it

257
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,320
that

258
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,080
activists response like manals is like

259
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,320
i'm out of here you know i'm out of here

260
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
instead of

261
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,839
you know i i can't

262
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,600
emotionally

263
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,839
or otherwise respond to the content

264
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,600
that's the false content that's coming

265
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,440
through tech companies essentially have

266
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,600
been co-opted by so many authoritarian

267
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
states and it looks like they're winning

268
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,760
yeah the other side is winning um and

269
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,800
that there

270
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
has been a failure in terms of

271
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,320
accountability in a lot of these tech

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,920
companies and the odd thing is as well

273
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,680
and i sort of want to look at you behind

274
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
down here and there and um because

275
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,240
you're in a big screen behind us but um

276
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,200
there you are uh but just to say that

277
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,839
you know in many countries also like the

278
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,079
tech platform's actually the buffer

279
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,480
between the citizen and the state and so

280
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,079
you're in this sort of conflicting

281
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
position where like you know in myanmar

282
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,760
use activists in ethiopia sudan i mean

283
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,680
you name a country activists are

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,839
desperate to be able to get to a neutral

285
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,600
platform to be able to convey to the

286
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,160
rest of the world what's going on and

287
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,680
but if it's if it's if it's unsafe if

288
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,600
it's politically unsafe i mean we know

289
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,880
that there are instances you save

290
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
individuals who are still detained as a

291
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,560
result of that leakage you also

292
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,320
mentioned the issue of surveillance i

293
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,640
think it's not just about you know sort

294
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
of content and false information it's

295
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,160
also about tracking right um and you'd

296
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,000
be good to you know we and the other

297
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,519
thing that we know is that the saudi

298
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,680
government is not just tracking citizens

299
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,560
inside saudi but actually across borders

300
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,000
as well so it'd be good for you to talk

301
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,160
a little bit about that about the sort

302
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,240
of surveillance regime that you've seen

303
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,200
within saudi and its activities um

304
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
across

305
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,399
um into different jurisdictions and how

306
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
successful um

307
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,160
have the saudis been with their

308
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,360
surveillance

309
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,440
outside their borders that's an

310
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,920
interesting one

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
one of the activists or the women to

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,920
drive movement activists who was jailed

313
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
i was lucky because i live in australia

314
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,480
um i escaped jail

315
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,640
when she left jail she sent me a message

316
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,120
on what's up and she said oh my god i

317
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,800
couldn't believe she was out of jail and

318
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,639
i was just checking with her if she's

319
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,680
okay

320
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,440
and i said hey don't use what's whatsapp

321
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
can you talk to me on signal or telegram

322
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,399
or wicker or any of the activists that

323
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,160
we use and i'm a cyber security expert

324
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:04,399
like this is i teach activists how to

325
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,079
stay secure online

326
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:08,440
and i just said no no and this was

327
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,200
2017 2018 maybe

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,160
and

329
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,880
she said no no they can see everything

330
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,240
as if they are

331
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,720
shoulder surfing as they are next to you

332
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,480
looking at your screen and i'm like how

333
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,639
there is encryption what do you mean

334
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,120
uh if it's encrypted they can intercept

335
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,360
encrypted messages she said no no they

336
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,360
use tools that we didn't know what but

337
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,920
they they showed me messages

338
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,560
that we use encrypted channels

339
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,000
to sin

340
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,240
and i couldn't believe it

341
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,760
and then when citizen lab came out with

342
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,320
nso group the pegasus yeah and it's

343
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,560
funny because i have all the you know

344
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,399
the two-factor authentication on my

345
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,360
phone where it has to send me a message

346
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,279
and i was paying attention that my

347
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,800
accounts been sending me a message from

348
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,560
a number in turkey

349
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,200
so my two-way authentic they hacked even

350
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,200
my two-way authenticator

351
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,920
and i had to i always changed my phone

352
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,000
because uh i know that i've been

353
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,839
targeted by pegasus

354
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,240
and i keep changing like i i

355
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
i keep changing my phone because

356
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
speakers is in cyber security you always

357
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,720
teach people don't click on links from

358
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
unknown sources right with pegasus it

359
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,320
doesn't work

360
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,839
they have the zero

361
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,839
they the zero click

362
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,800
exploit i've never had this in my life

363
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,399
and i've been working in cyber security

364
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,959
since 2002. i'm a computer scientist too

365
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
like i said it five years computer

366
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,000
science

367
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,440
so

368
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
when the activists were telling me

369
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,680
i was still thinking this is like sci-fi

370
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,600
this is not true

371
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,320
uh guys i work in cyber security you're

372
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,680
undermining my experience in this

373
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:53,680
but apparently we are actually dealing

374
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,680
with unprecedented uh enemy which is the

375
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,639
the private hacking tools that being

376
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,959
built by some of the top

377
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,199
the israelis are known to be some of the

378
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,959
top when it comes to cyber security

379
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,000
because they

380
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
they exist in a

381
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,199
an area of geopolitical unrest so that

382
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,440
their survival mechanism is to be to

383
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,199
learn the offensive

384
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,639
but when they started selling that

385
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,959
because saudi arabia didn't have the

386
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
capacity to create such tools but now

387
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
they have the money to go and that's

388
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,160
right these two and this is actually and

389
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,519
maybe unless you have a follow-up

390
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,120
question as well but i just want to

391
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,720
touch on this point about the

392
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
surveillance trade i think it's

393
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,320
essential that

394
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:39,440
the rights con community understands

395
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,000
the commerce that's attached to this the

396
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,639
money that's behind this and it's why we

397
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,959
as an organization together with many

398
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,720
others like amnesty international and

399
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,240
human rights watch

400
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:53,120
have called for a moratorium on the sale

401
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
of

402
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,560
spyware the trade in spyware because

403
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,839
there's a number of things that can

404
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,839
happen if we can put export licenses in

405
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,240
place sanctions in place

406
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,320
regulatory environments companies

407
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,839
essentially

408
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,519
companies are selling

409
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,279
and governments are buying

410
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,040
and it's you know this this call for a

411
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
moratorium it also came through the high

412
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,600
commissioner um in her statement um

413
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,839
which was released this week absolutely

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,360
essential that we

415
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,199
both shine a light on this trade and

416
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,120
that we also put an end to it i think a

417
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,199
lot of people forget um

418
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,279
perhaps not this particular community

419
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,000
but

420
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,360
you know most or a lot the majority uh

421
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
of the sales of surveillance is still

422
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,759
coming um from the united states and

423
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:37,279
europe

424
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,040
china really wants to get in on the

425
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,959
market as well

426
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,720
and it's focusing a lot on the global

427
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,519
south by undercutting in terms of price

428
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,920
what it can offer in in terms of

429
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,639
surveillance hardware and software

430
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:51,759
but still

431
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:53,440
some of the biggest producers of

432
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,199
surveillance software is coming out of

433
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,040
the democracy are coming out it was good

434
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,000
to see the us government did put um the

435
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,800
nso group which produces pegasus on its

436
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,079
entity list

437
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,240
um blacklisted it on its entity list

438
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
which was excellent and i think we've

439
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,880
seen the costa rican government also now

440
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,639
call for a moratorium it's the first

441
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,160
government that's called for it so i

442
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
think we're at a tipping point we need

443
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,759
this rightscon

444
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:21,360
community to really talk to

445
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,800
our governments and the companies that

446
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,160
are listening that this

447
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,639
this is actually a trade in weapons and

448
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,199
i think we need to understand it as such

449
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,720
um i'm also interested in uh

450
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,079
the kind of

451
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,560
the role of like the cloud centers and

452
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,560
the location of data centers within

453
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,639
saudi you know there's been a recent

454
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,680
move by a number of organizations to

455
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,480
get a resolution at the agm at google to

456
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,279
say

457
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,720
that there really needs to be proper

458
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,800
human rights due diligence

459
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,759
on the location of data centers

460
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
and this suggestion that there will be a

461
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,440
data center

462
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
located in in saudi arabia can you

463
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,959
reflect upon that for a second

464
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,679
um it's interesting because

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,000
i want my country to be prosperous and i

466
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,919
want them to have the advancement of

467
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:12,000
technology and enjoy that

468
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,359
of course i want this to my country

469
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,799
my problem is not with have building a

470
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:22,160
data center in saudi arabia

471
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,000
my problem is

472
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
with

473
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,079
saudi arabia can buy it from google can

474
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:30,320
buy it from china can buy it from any

475
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
anyone else so it doesn't really matter

476
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,799
who they buy there there is always even

477
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,919
when you

478
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:37,360
uh let's say

479
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,320
anything group there's a big backlash

480
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,160
against them there are other hundred

481
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,039
initial group under the table quietly

482
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,799
selling their technology

483
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
i think

484
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,280
we do need a universal declaration of

485
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,720
digital rights

486
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,559
that annexed to the universal

487
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:56,640
declaration of human rights and all the

488
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,200
uin members sign that

489
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,640
so whatever technology that saudi arabia

490
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,840
or whatever the

491
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:07,120
authoritarian regimes end up using

492
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
when there are abuses

493
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,559
at least there the people who've been

494
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,480
this technology being used against them

495
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,480
they're aware there's a way for them to

496
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,200
to to tell because unfortunately the u.s

497
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,880
you talk about any small group they

498
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,880
bought the initial group they use an iso

499
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,880
group against its own citizens yeah so

500
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,360
even like it's it's it's a very

501
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
difficult situation where we live today

502
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,720
uh democracies abusing their citizens

503
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,280
trust uh dictatorships to

504
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,919
most companies the northern star is

505
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,640
profit as long as our northern star is

506
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
our profit profit will always be over

507
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,919
people it doesn't matter human rights uh

508
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,280
violations

509
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,520
that happens because of the technology

510
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,039
that we create

511
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,120
as long as our north has not and i think

512
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,960
those shareholders

513
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,360
if they're brave enough shareholders

514
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,480
should really say that our success is

515
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,160
not only the profit that we make in the

516
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,640
next quarter but actually is

517
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,480
as you mentioned human rights due

518
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,840
diligence uh social corporate

519
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,799
responsibility uh

520
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,919
environmental all this should be part of

521
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,720
what major success we can live in a

522
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,760
world where the the profit

523
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,919
drives all our decisions and i think

524
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,760
that that

525
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
is what hurting human rights that was

526
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,400
hurting the planet that's what's hurting

527
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
those companies themselves because when

528
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,960
are we going to learn it's what

529
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
we're not going to live in in this world

530
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,400
for long if we still continue doing

531
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,720
business as usual the way we do

532
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,320
actually um we're going to get into a q

533
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:45,200
a

534
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,840
section soon but um i'm wondering before

535
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:50,080
we do that when i'll if i can take a

536
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
step back and ask you where things stand

537
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
in saudi arabia

538
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,480
you said earlier that you want your

539
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,440
country to be prosperous

540
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,280
do people there

541
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,039
are they happy

542
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,120
do you get a sense of

543
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,960
to what extent they have access to free

544
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,600
information to what extent do you feel

545
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:12,240
like there's enough dissent and people

546
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,080
are unsatisfied and all of this of

547
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,159
course is so hard to gauge because of

548
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,600
the social media uh problem but

549
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,240
tell us a little bit about that

550
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
unfortunately

551
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,120
social media being used effectively to

552
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:30,240
change the discourse in saudi arabia and

553
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,559
to push the agenda of the

554
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,440
the government uh there is um the

555
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,600
brainwashing i've been seeing now for

556
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,520
highly educated people who i thought

557
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,520
they have critical thinking

558
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
is something i've never experienced in

559
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,559
my life

560
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,000
which is very interesting there's so

561
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
much distraction happening by opening

562
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,760
cinemas and

563
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:51,039
allowing

564
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:52,640
music festivals for the first time in

565
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:54,880
saudi arabia and dakar whatever

566
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,440
and it's really just that bling that

567
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,760
distracts people from the bigger issue

568
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,919
which is human rights civil rights

569
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,320
political rights that they don't have

570
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,000
there are hundreds of thousands in jails

571
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,039
today

572
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,039
no one talks about them there is a

573
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,919
shutdown of any descent

574
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,320
whether online or

575
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,120
in real life there is this intimidation

576
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,039
that happens it's very very clearly

577
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:21,600
happened uh through so you don't find

578
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,840
really voices the voices being shut down

579
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,480
in saudi arabia

580
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,280
it's a sad reality i do want my country

581
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,120
to be prosperous i don't want to be to

582
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,120
have sanctions against the country but

583
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,679
at the same time

584
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,760
people

585
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:38,720
uh

586
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,360
there's a way to go for people to

587
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,679
demand their civil rights and political

588
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,600
rights and be part of their decision

589
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,039
making instead of just still being

590
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,039
treated like children

591
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,280
in saudi arabia that decisions been

592
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,400
taken

593
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
in our absence

594
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,760
and we have to follow and it's a highly

595
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
educated country like 99 percent of the

596
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:03,120
internet penetration 99 the internet

597
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,840
penetration in saudi arabia

598
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:07,200
around 99

599
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,440
is the literacy uh

600
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,960
people are highly educated they go to

601
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,440
colleges mostly they study in the us

602
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,200
but they go back to saudi arabia and

603
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,120
when you live in that eco chamber saudi

604
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,400
arabia use

605
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,440
us picks if anyone heard of aspects

606
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,600
auspix is a behavioral communication

607
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,520
company all the people who lived

608
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:28,000
cambridge analytica were hired by

609
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,600
auspice auspix is being uh is owned by

610
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,480
the emiratis actually uh through a proxy

611
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,919
egyptian proxy that works for the

612
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,600
emirati government

613
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,559
and they use behavioral communication

614
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:43,120
to change how people think about their

615
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
governments so people when i talk to

616
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,799
them back home they're happy

617
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
they think i'm the ungrateful one

618
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,960
uh because i live abroad and i'm like

619
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,000
wow yeah so it's funny middle eastern

620
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,480
cambridge analytica which is auspex by

621
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,960
the way yeah i mean i just what you're

622
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,039
saying it strikes such a cord because i

623
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,760
think there's a tendency to think of

624
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,120
authoritarianism and equate it with a

625
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
country that is

626
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,360
very poor like north korea or something

627
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
and what we're really seeing is that a

628
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,360
lot of countries can be prosperous and

629
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:16,000
authoritarian can be highly educated and

630
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,760
authoritarian and high-tech and

631
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,240
high-tech like china we were discussing

632
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,280
before this idea that like you know the

633
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,039
saudis trying to move away from oil

634
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:26,559
trying to move into high tech and

635
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,960
therefore tech had traditionally be

636
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,360
thought of as like tech openness freedom

637
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,600
of expression free flow of data etc but

638
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,440
this idea about being high-tech and

639
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,280
suppressive at the same time which i

640
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,280
think the chinese have kind of you know

641
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,679
at the forefront of it's a it's a shift

642
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:43,760
in the way we're in the midst of a shift

643
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,919
in the way that we have to understand

644
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,000
um you know and as you're coming back to

645
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
your first point which is like

646
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
tech is actually the pathway to

647
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:52,880
suppression

648
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,400
um yeah

649
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
yeah but

650
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
yeah can i say one thing you've got to

651
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,919
take place and then i want to ask you

652
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,520
about encryption there's a question or

653
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,559
two yeah from the audience but please

654
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,440
take makes a christian soft it's a soft

655
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:08,320
oppression it's tick makes

656
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:10,880
the illusion of freedom

657
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:11,840
uh

658
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,000
so real and that what scares me about

659
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
technology yeah

660
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
um there's a couple of questions from

661
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,480
the audience one relates to encryption

662
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,400
could you give us a sense of like what

663
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
your message to leaders the tech

664
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,120
companies and within governments

665
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,880
is with respect to the importance of

666
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,320
encryption you kind of touched on it

667
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,520
before

668
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,039
but it would be good to expand because

669
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,039
you know this is the the encryption wars

670
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:36,640
that we're still in

671
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,120
um it doesn't seem to go away so like

672
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
great to hear what your key message is

673
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,440
my key message is

674
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,919
china been harvesting a lot of data in

675
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,600
the last few years they've been

676
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,760
investing a lot in quantum computing

677
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,400
quantum computing will actually decrypt

678
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,799
the existing encryption so good luck

679
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,039
with encryption

680
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,760
yeah we have talked in some of the

681
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,880
sessions here throughout the week about

682
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,799
the relationship between quantum and

683
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,080
encryption

684
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,799
and

685
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,720
it's close it's very close quantum

686
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,880
computing we thought it's going to be 50

687
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,720
years until we have quantum computing

688
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,159
that unlock the

689
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:16,799
existing encryption that's not true and

690
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,440
it's happening very soon yeah and one of

691
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,840
the things about quantum i think is

692
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,000
obviously we want quantum encryption but

693
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:25,919
we don't want quantum com

694
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,159
computing power to be able to decrypt

695
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,640
past things that are well

696
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,480
that's and so

697
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,600
how do we

698
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,760
um how do we prepare for that you know

699
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,559
if encryption if quantum is

700
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
you know five or ten years away or

701
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,200
whatever the actual you know the years

702
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,080
and there's been some recent

703
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,080
announcements actually indicating you

704
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,440
know indicating that we um will

705
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,720
um be facing you know the application of

706
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,559
quantum computing

707
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,360
you know presently um how do we prepare

708
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,159
for that like how do we get ready for

709
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,400
um how do we re-encrypt or how do we

710
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,679
delete

711
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,200
you will hear something shocking for me

712
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,559
that you want to hear from computer

713
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,840
scientists okay or a

714
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,440
technology i think that our things had

715
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
to be have to be done in the

716
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
old-fashioned way where it doesn't have

717
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,440
to be online

718
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:20,400
it has to be offline and i think once

719
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,840
you go online that's it game over anyone

720
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,720
with the time and money will have access

721
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:29,279
to your data right i think that's the

722
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,760
next phase i mean just like

723
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,520
i mean that's what i do as a journalist

724
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,360
if i really want to be secure i meet

725
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,600
somebody in person or i write a letter

726
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,919
an old-fashioned letter

727
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,320
um uh manal

728
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,640
i want to get to this question um it's

729
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,720
probably a good note to end on the

730
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,559
question is what can feminists from

731
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
outside of saudi arabia help or how can

732
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,679
they help improve women's rights in the

733
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,640
country so how how can the women of the

734
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,559
world unite and work on this issue

735
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,360
uh

736
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,720
i think

737
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:05,200
my dream is we don't have feminists

738
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,279
we don't point out women that's my dream

739
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,360
but that's maybe my my grandchildren

740
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,880
will live this dream

741
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,840
how we can help is just to be self-aware

742
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,679
that's the first thing i think all of us

743
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,840
we need to be self-aware men and women

744
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,840
and we need to learn to know our fears

745
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,760
being self-aware and knowing our fears

746
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,159
is very important because sometimes our

747
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,240
fears are the ones that stops and the

748
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
way of speaking up of when we see

749
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,919
injustice or when we want to demand

750
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:38,399
our rights we want to create

751
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,360
a long-standing status quo and i live in

752
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,039
australia and

753
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,279
and i see the women even here struggle

754
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:46,720
when they reach

755
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,480
positions of power

756
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
and i'm like wow this is interesting you

757
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,760
have all the rules and policies that

758
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:53,279
supports women in power but you don't

759
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,039
find women in power because the culture

760
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:56,480
didn't change

761
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,799
and and women can't speak up or don't

762
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,159
want to speak up because they're so

763
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
scared of being pointed like singled out

764
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,880
as troublemakers

765
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,799
i think feminists not

766
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,320
calling it feminist just being a woman

767
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,240
or being a human it's just being

768
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,559
self-aware learning how to speak up and

769
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,480
learning that that struggle for women's

770
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:17,120
rights anywhere in the world contributes

771
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
to women rights around the world i think

772
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,720
that is very important to know the

773
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:22,720
collective

774
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,279
yeah i was actually going to say like

775
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:26,880
i would also like to flip the question

776
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:29,440
as well which is like

777
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,200
whether you you know like the term

778
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,960
feminists or not or see the knee but

779
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,720
like there's this idea about like what

780
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,520
can

781
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,960
the women

782
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,600
uh the feminists of saudi arabia also

783
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:41,840
teach feminists around the world as well

784
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,760
i think it's hopefully a kind of

785
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,360
collective multi-directional

786
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:48,399
conversation because you know i mean i

787
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,240
in preparation for this discussion i had

788
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,240
a look at you know your some of the

789
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,640
videos that you posted in 2011 i watched

790
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,960
your ted talk and i could see a lot of

791
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,159
women in the audience just like

792
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:03,039
you know just in or of what you and your

793
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
community had managed to what the

794
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,760
feminists had managed to do what the

795
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,279
women drivers have managed to do not

796
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,600
just to the issue of driving but also

797
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,440
how does that impact

798
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,000
the society as a whole and i think that

799
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,760
you know roe v wade and developments

800
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:16,960
that are happening it's a constant

801
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,880
battle whether it be on you know

802
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,120
reproductive rights or lgbt rights etc

803
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,320
like we gotta have we have to

804
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:24,559
continuously learn from each other and

805
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:25,520
you know you've been in a very

806
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,960
constrained environment you're now in

807
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:30,159
australia um there's so much that we can

808
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,679
learn from you and i think we've already

809
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:32,960
learned from you and

810
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,640
i don't know i i would like to we will

811
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,200
definitely continue this conversation uh

812
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,600
at future rights cons because

813
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,360
it's so important to the future of our

814
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,880
society and the enjoyment of human

815
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,200
rights on and offline

816
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,279
mana al-sharif thank you so much for
