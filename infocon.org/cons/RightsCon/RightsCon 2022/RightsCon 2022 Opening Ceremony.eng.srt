some of the many thousands of

11
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,199
participants of rights con including

12
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,320
politicians policy makers

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,119
activists and even creatives

14
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:10,960
for the first person in the studio

15
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,200
though we have somebody from axis now

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,000
nikki gladstone director of rightscon

17
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,479
basically without nikki there would be

18
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,360
no rights khan so welcome and i'm sure

19
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,119
you have a lot to tell us about what's

20
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,520
new for this year's summit yeah thank

21
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,439
you so much and i think you know maybe

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,960
thanks to me but also a giant team from

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,439
accessnow and the studio and our

24
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,720
production teams who've really come

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,720
together to make rightscon happen as

26
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,159
well as the you know many session

27
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,600
organizers and participants who've

28
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,000
shaped the program we're really excited

29
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,240
this year to be bringing the studio uh

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,079
we've we've been doing rightscon online

31
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:48,560
for the last three years and it's been

32
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
exceptional to create this online home

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,720
for rightscon but having the studio to

34
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:55,280
act as a home base i think will be a

35
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,439
really welcoming

36
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,759
experience for participants and

37
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
hopefully a place where people can come

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,360
and understand what's happening

39
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,719
throughout the week of writes con

40
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,719
there's a lot of excellent programming

41
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,959
there's a film festival there are you

42
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:10,959
know creative exhibits so it's not just

43
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
about the the meat of the program the

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,480
sessions it's also about um you know

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,560
unwinding and meeting people and

46
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,879
connecting yeah because we've just gone

47
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,959
through the last two years of this

48
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,879
pandemic and

49
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,959
it's it's been hard and for some people

50
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,720
in parts of the world they're in

51
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,560
entering a post-pandemic world but for

52
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,720
many others they're still under lockdown

53
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,800
or they still can't really go out they

54
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,280
certainly can't travel to a summit so

55
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,120
you have this hybrid in this fantastic

56
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,080
studio that's my home but everybody's

57
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,280
home over the the next week i mean uh it

58
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,319
took you a year right to plan all this

59
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,680
yeah you know i think that's a really

60
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,599
great point and i think you know while

61
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,160
everyone is experiencing some return to

62
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,519
in person there's a lot of different

63
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,360
realities around the world and what

64
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,120
we're doing with the studio is bringing

65
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,280
a little bit of in person to rightscon

66
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
participants no matter where they are i

67
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,040
mean we've been working on this program

68
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,200
since last year session organizers

69
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,440
submit their proposals up until january

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,040
and then they work with us over the

71
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,800
course of many months to make sure that

72
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,720
those sessions are going to achieve

73
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
outcomes not just have conversations but

74
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,959
really make sure that they're able to

75
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,560
move forward the dial on the work that

76
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,200
they're doing and so it's been months of

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
work to get this program together and

78
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,599
it's going to be excellent and

79
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,440
i'm really excited to see what comes out

80
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,360
of this week this week is going to be

81
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,200
exceptional in and of itself but there's

82
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,440
also so much work that's going to carry

83
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
out into the weeks after rightscon in

84
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,760
the months after rightscon so i i really

85
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,920
think this is going to be an agenda

86
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,239
setting program and it's going to have a

87
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,120

to defend and extend digital rights

114
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,720

leaders you know thank you for

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,759
prioritizing this conversation because i

122
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,280
consider it to be one of the most

123
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,280
important that we could be having as

124
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
political leaders policy makers and

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,120
advocates right now

126
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,960
you know we're facing what i would call

127
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,919
a challenging digital environment and i

128
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,520
don't need to tell those who have joined

129
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,039
us virtually today

130
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,560
of the abuses of the internet

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,800
suppression of online freedoms

132
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
and the evolving challenge of in

133
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,520
particular disinformation uh the threats

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,880
to human rights and democratic

135
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,680
institutions globally in the real world

136
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
consequences of these challenges you

137
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,199
know you could argue are more apparent

138
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
now than they've ever been

139
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,080
as i speak there is a war in europe

140
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,320
where disinformation and propaganda

141
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,280
online is playing a key role

142
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,639
now here in new zealand we recognize

143
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,039
the critical importance of protecting

144
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,400
and promoting human rights and

145
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
fundamental freedoms and the modern

146
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,120
threats to both and that's why i'm

147
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,880
really honoured amongst all of those

148
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,240
that you could have called to speak

149
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,479
today to be the first head of government

150
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,039
to address rightscon because the issues

151
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
that rightscon addresses

152
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,199
deserve leader level attention because

153
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,960
as i say these are some of the most

154
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,560
important issues that we could be

155
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,280
talking about today so i'm pleased bret

156
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,360
to start the conversation thank you so

157
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,240
much um we might cut that little clip

158
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,840
and send it off to other world leaders

159
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,280
for

160
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,759
next year's event um because i agree i

161
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,160
think these issues have moved you know

162
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
to the ceo level to the board level to

163
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,400
the prime minister and president level

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,479
and that's the appropriate thing um i

165
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,240
actually wanted to kick off you know

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,840
you're the prime minister of new zealand

167
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,840
smack bang in the middle of the asia

168
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,160
pacific region um it might be a good

169
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,639
place to start particularly the given

170
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,039
the increasing global

171
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
focus on your region

172
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
could you reflect for a moment on on on

173
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,080
the path forward for for the events but

174
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,520
of digital rights in

175
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,280
from the asia pacific region and i also

176
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,520
say that because we have hundreds of

177
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,479
people from all all across asia pacific

178
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
who are here today and will participate

179
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,360
over the coming five days

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,319
you know i think if you're thinking

181
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,039
about our region it's a snapshot of the

182
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,639
diversity

183
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,479
the opportunity and the challenge or

184
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,560
within this large and diverse asia

185
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
pacific region we've got a spectrum of

186
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:16,080
cultures

187
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,080
spectrum of political systems in our

188
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,800
region and very different approaches to

189
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,599
the issues of digital rights

190
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,199
so as a region

191
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:26,960
on the plus i went on for digital

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
innovation

193
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
and advances research and development

194
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,560
tech entrepreneurship

195
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
uh such openness and innovation though

196
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,759
does not always translate to

197
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,919
robust protections of digital rights

198
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,599
right so you can see that play out in

199
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,360
some parts of our region if i was to

200
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,520
give an example myanmar that's a stark

201
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,039
example with the

202
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,280
erosion of rights online and offline

203
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
including freedom of expression media

204
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,840
freedoms and democratic rights are

205
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
playing are playing out every day

206
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,639
from a new zealand perspective digital

207
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:01,440
rights so should be grounded and

208
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,400
free

209
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,680
open secure and increasingly you'll hear

210
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,800
uh into an interoperable internet

211
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
and in this context we really welcome

212
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
and have signed up to the declaration

213
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,039
for the future of the internet which was

214
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,919
launched in late um april

215
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,080
but i think what's funny talk to us is

216
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,360
that all of these challenges that we

217
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,360
face as a reason region to think about a

218
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,240
multi-stakeholder approach to internet

219
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,240
governance which is embedded in the

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,520
declaration

221
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,120
and you'll see in the way that we

222
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,080
approach

223
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,399
many of these challenges that that

224
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,799
multi-stakeholder approach

225
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,958
is fundamental to the way we operate

226
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
open dialogue debate accountability

227
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
transparency and multi-stakeholderism it

228
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,200
makes a difference and that is how we'll

229
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,760
drive effective and enduring change

230
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,200
so to those who are championing that

231
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,120
with asia within asia pacific and

232
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,560
elsewhere

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,399
we support you

234
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,760
again i think i'm going to take that

235
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,440
clip and send it to many of the leaders

236
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,160
in the region who don't see

237
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,360
multi-stakeholderism as the appropriate

238
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,200
approach that are thinking very much

239
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,040
about you know clamping down thanks for

240
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,519
raising the country myanmar many of our

241
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
colleagues uh are online many of our

242
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,040
colleagues have left the country because

243
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,040
of that online repression not just the

244
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,560
question of not being multi-stakeholder

245
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,200
but actually being persecuted for being

246
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,880
you know members of civil society or

247
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,880
members of community who's calling for

248
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,880
democracy and so on not just in me and

249
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,959
my across all of the democracies as well

250
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
even you know in my own country of

251
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:31,839
australia we've seen you know a lot of

252
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,080
new laws that have been passed that have

253
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:35,920
implications for all of us and i think

254
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,800
that one of the one of the um you know

255
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,120
reasons why governments are pushing so

256
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,600
hard is and or as an excuse is to deal

257
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,200
with this issue of like violent

258
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,760
extremist content and terrorist content

259
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,720
and you know it's definitely a plague

260
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,800
it's plagued your own country

261
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,720
led to the christ church paul we've seen

262
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,440
it most recently you know terrorist

263
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,200
violent extremist and terrorist content

264
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,399
in the u.s

265
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,640
so maybe you can give us a sense of like

266
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
when you think about that idea of how

267
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,839
governments and companies and civil

268
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,240
society can work together on this issue

269
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,240
of preventing the spread of terrorist

270
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
and violent extremist content

271
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,360
what are the lessons that you've learned

272
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,200
from the christchurch call

273
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,920
i think it's it's very pertinent right

274
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,920
now and we really need to make sure that

275
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,320
we don't have these knee-jerk reactions

276
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,079
that we don't have laws and policies

277
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,680
that are covering up for really

278
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,560
repression of you know other voices um

279
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:30,240
i'd love to hear what you have to what

280
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,279
you've learned and what you have to

281
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
share with us

282
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,399
when i think back to the uh immediate

283
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
aftermath of march 15

284
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,200
uh 2019 in new zealand

285
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,320
you know

286
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,880
sadly so many countries have experienced

287
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,160
uh

288
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,720
something similar to what we experienced

289
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,760
perpetrated against our muslim community

290
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,640
but what happened here was was different

291
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,600
and because it was broadcast it was so

292
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
clearly designed to be broadcast online

293
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,320
and and that was that was a global first

294
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,880
so i remember a lot of pressure coming

295
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:09,440
on for new zealand to uh respond to the

296
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,560
online element of that terrorist act

297
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,160
and politicians necessarily uh as as

298
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,920
others do reach for whatever's in their

299
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,920
toolbox and what's in a politician's

300
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
toolbox is regulation and legislative

301
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,320
change

302
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,000
but what became

303
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,560
clear to me was that if that was our

304
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,880
only response it would unlikely be a

305
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,760
successful one in the long term because

306
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,680
regulation can often be a blunt

307
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,760
instrument it's not the only answer

308
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,360
particularly

309
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,120
in areas where

310
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,320
the environment changes so rapidly

311
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,040
and so that was one of the reasons

312
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,440
we took stock of what we experienced and

313
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,560
asked ourselves how we create enduring

314
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,680
change

315
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,920
and how can we do it together so i

316
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,000
remember reaching out to prison emmanuel

317
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,839
macron and we founded the christchurch

318
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,000
call in 2019

319
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,360
and at its heart was that idea of

320
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,560
multi-stakeholderism working together on

321
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,120
the solution so governments we have that

322
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,839
responsibility to keep our citizens safe

323
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,200
to protect their human rights and

324
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,480
freedoms

325
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,800
but making sure that we use regulation

326
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,560
where it is where it is needed and where

327
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,920
it is effective

328
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:22,079
companies they have the data the tools

329
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:22,839
and the

330
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,560
resources uh

331
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,279
i would argue it's in their interest and

332
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,720
always has been

333
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,920
to make sure that they're keeping their

334
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:31,360
customers safe and that they're

335
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,800
contributing constructively to these

336
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,120
issues because everyone agrees

337
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,040
we don't want an environment where

338
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,800
violent extremism and terrorism is

339
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,440
perpetuated online and civil society

340
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,839
through the course advisory network has

341
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,639
provided expertise knowledge advice

342
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,880
caution and wisdom

343
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,320
and the reason they're bred i just want

344
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,120
to dwell on civil society it's very easy

345
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,000
in a liberal democracy like new zealand

346
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,760
and to think about these challenges from

347
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,760
a particular lens

348
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,160
we have it's incumbent on us to make

349
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,600
sure is that we reach into these issues

350
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,560
we're thinking about it from the

351
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,279
perspective of some nations and citizens

352
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,839
who may not have their uh their rights

353
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:12,639
protected as a starting point and so

354
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
it's critical civil society brings that

355
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
lens and that caution to make sure that

356
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
what we do is fit for purpose beyond our

357
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,680
own uh beyond our own borders

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,399
yeah and and for many people

359
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,240
you know who are on the call but also

360
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,160
you know internet users around the world

361
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
it's actually often the state itself

362
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,639
that's the perpetrator of the violence

363
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:35,519
and

364
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,839
and i think many organizations are

365
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,360
coping with

366
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,920
um you know a state that is designing

367
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,639
legislation and designing regulation

368
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,959
forcing the hands of of their own

369
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,000
companies and also foreign companies um

370
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,279
to

371
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,240
do you know to to criminalize speech and

372
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,600
to invade privacy and to put populations

373
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,839
at risk and so you know as it's really

374
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,920
good that you point out the the kind of

375
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,920
dichotomy there and again in the region

376
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,440
but also globally

377
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,959
yeah and this is why within the

378
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,279
christchurch call we embedded those

379
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,800
principles

380
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,519
and so although it was a reaction to a

381
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,720
horrific terrorist attack we at the same

382
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,720
time acknowledge that in our response we

383
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,800
needed everything that we did to be

384
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,680
embedded around free open and secure

385
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,800
internet

386
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,760
so we have now at my last uh

387
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,800
count

388
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,199
we have uh 55 government supporters and

389
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:36,240
in the onboarding process we apply this

390
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,639
this lens uh as well

391
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,480
yeah no that's great and i think the

392
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:41,920
other piece of course that you mentioned

393
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
is that the role of the company and and

394
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,839
you know we

395
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,079
as access now but also so many

396
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,160
organizations around the world have been

397
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,920
pushing the companies to understand

398
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,120
like how

399
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,440
content and information is weaponized

400
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,279
and how important it is

401
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
to have language

402
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,639
and to understand the language in which

403
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,120
hate is expressed uh you know we've

404
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,040
dealt with this in ethiopia in myanmar

405
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,920
and india like you know across the globe

406
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,079
and to allocate the proper resources not

407
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,079
to just have the algorithm but to have

408
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,839
proper human resources which has you

409
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,240
know labor implications as well but you

410
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,199
know

411
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,279
have proper human resources that are

412
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
allocated to this issue because we know

413
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,519
it's not going away and also the

414
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,760
technologies are changing and i actually

415
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,839
wanted to ask you in the context you

416
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
know about the the metaverse and you

417
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,720
know

418
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,880
in a lot of conversation about like you

419
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,040
know what is this next generation of of

420
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,800
technology what is this next generation

421
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,680
of decentralized internet you know

422
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
um

423
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
web 3 et cetera there's a lot of

424
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,279
buzzwords but like how are you thinking

425
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,800
as a government when you think about

426
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,240
these new technologies in terms of

427
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,160
regulation or in terms of innovation or

428
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,920
in terms of sending guard rails

429
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,600
and that's a great way to express it

430
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,240
whether it's called you know web 3.0 or

431
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,839
metaverse or

432
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:03,920
something else entirely

433
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,399
the changes uh we sing or the new ways

434
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,480
of interacting online is upon us and

435
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,279
it's moving very very quickly yeah and

436
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:12,560
this offers

437
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,160
opportunities

438
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,680
that you know perhaps many would have

439
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,680
only previously imagined but as with all

440
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:22,480
new technologies it will also

441
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,279
present new manifestations of risk and

442
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,519
so we need to think about both the set

443
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
of challenges to protection of rights

444
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,120
which we need to better understand but

445
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,240
we also

446
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,480
need to anticipate the issues

447
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,399
uh that we might encounter instead of

448
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
reacting further down the track and that

449
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,199
work should be underway now uh rather

450
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:43,759
than after because it risks realised

451
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,680
harm and

452
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,680
we've also learned through experience as

453
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,880
you and i were discussing that

454
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,920
retrofitting solutions is so hard and

455
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,600
much of what we've experienced around

456
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,199
the christchurch call are attempts to

457
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,920
retrofit solutions

458
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
and so this is a time for

459
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,480
stakeholders and as i've already

460
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:05,439
expressed in my view a multi-stakeholder

461
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,520
approach on the topic it's a time to

462
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,039
hear from technologists who are creating

463
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:10,640
and living already in this world the

464
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,400
policymakers navigating this issues

465
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,400
lawyers academics and activists we need

466
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,240
to be working collectively now

467
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,839
and that means co-development and

468
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:22,880
co-design not just consultation uh

469
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
because these issues are upon us

470
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,199
the one thing i would also add is that

471
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,760
from from government's perspectives

472
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,360
whilst policy makers are very much in

473
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,280
the space i think government

474
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,360
uh governments for by and large will

475
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,120
still be grappling with retrofitting the

476
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:38,559
environment we're in now and it does

477
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
mean that there's perhaps not as much

478
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,440
thinking going into uh the what next as

479
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,600
it needs to be i think i think we in

480
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,440
civil society are finding that like

481
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,880
we're dealing with the long tail like

482
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,960
you know we're working on the ai act in

483
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,600
the european union context yeah um you

484
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,960
know but at the same time we're also

485
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,039
meant to be like on

486
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,200
you know quantum computing which is five

487
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,799
or ten years away it seems to be five or

488
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,400
ten years away for the last you know 30

489
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,120
years but but this idea about how do we

490
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,360
actually preempt you know how do we

491
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,960
avoid the next need for the christ

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,039
church call because in the metaverse we

493
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:13,039
actually or whatever you know is yet to

494
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:14,880
come we have the proper frameworks in

495
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,760
place um so

496
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,240
i have one other question if that's okay

497
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,160
um which is related to the algorithmic

498
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
recommender systems i know that new

499
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,679
zealand's been looking into this how are

500
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,360
you engaging with the private sector on

501
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,919
this and any again any lessons or any

502
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:34,799
wisdom from this topic you'll see that

503
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:36,559
right from

504
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,799
the beginning of the christchurch call

505
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,120
to action we saw

506
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,120
algorithms as key to the work that we

507
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,240
needed to do it was part of the

508
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
christchurch call and there were a

509
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,520
couple of areas that we really did

510
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,559
prioritise straight off the bat um the

511
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,880
role of the gipps ct the crisis response

512
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,240
protocol all which have made a

513
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,760
difference but we're now really tuning

514
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,000
our minds to the issue

515
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,440
of algorithms

516
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,360
now this is a harder space

517
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:03,600
but interestingly

518
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,160
whilst some might argue

519
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,799
that this comes at it from

520
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
perhaps a lens uh

521
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,440
around free a challenge to free speech i

522
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,600
would argue that in an environment where

523
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,640
almost everything is curated it's really

524
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,840
important that

525
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,320
users have visibility of that curation

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,640
and they make informed choices about

527
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,400
their environment so i come at this from

528
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,840
a user's rights

529
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,520
approach as well

530
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,799
and so

531
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,120
in the spirit of a free open and secure

532
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,039
internet there is a need for improved

533
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,679
transparency and at the same time a much

534
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,440
clearer understanding of the outcomes of

535
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,360
algorithmic processes

536
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,679
so this is where we see online service

537
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,600
providers they have a responsibility

538
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,160
they develop and create these processes

539
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,280
uh and where we see outcomes that lead

540
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,280
to identifiable harms they have a

541
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,960
responsibility

542
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,480
to change course and develop solutions

543
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,880
so this is the next frontier really for

544
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:04,840
for all of us um we're coming in with a

545
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,120
constructive spirit

546
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,559
we've always said we respect the

547
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,720
protections around proprietary tools

548
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,720
that's been built into the call

549
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,240
but let's make our starting point

550
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,760
transparency

551
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,760
and research that enables us to see

552
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,520
these impacts and then that will help us

553
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
develop collectively the solutions that

554
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:22,799
are needed

555
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,320
yeah i mean thanks for raising that and

556
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,919
i do think that you know we've often

557
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,080
said that the algorithm is the black box

558
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,840
um the issue you know coming back to

559
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,679
this issue of like you know content and

560
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,080
propagation of of you know violent

561
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,240
content like how it gets picked up by

562
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,039
the algorithm how we as users don't

563
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,440
necessarily know um

564
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,360
why that happens that that sort of

565
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,200
content ends up in our feed and then

566
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
gets retweeted and reposted and so on

567
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,360
and sometimes the providers can't tell

568
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,840
us why either and this becomes extremely

569
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,440
problematic from a policy maker's

570
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,679
perspective we can see sometimes that we

571
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,760
have a problem but we can't necessarily

572
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,760
tell you how we got there how do you

573
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,320
define a solution in that environment so

574
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,240
let's let's begin with transparency and

575
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,679
just get around the table to work on

576
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,919
those solutions together yeah and i

577
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,320
would say ally to transparency is

578
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:12,080
ensuring that the human rights framework

579
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,440
is embedded

580
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,280
into the algorithm because we can have

581
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,440
transparency of poor process and poorer

582
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,720
outcomes and

583
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
algorithms we want actually the human

584
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,559
rights framework embedded um which is

585
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,440
probably a good ending point um for um

586
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,880
for this conversation even though i'd

587
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,760
love to talk with you for for the whole

588
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,679
full hour of the opening ceremony we've

589
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,760
got lots of great content coming forward

590
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,400
and we've got over 500 sessions uh

591
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,080
throughout the week hopefully you'll

592
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:39,919
have some time to d you know i know some

593
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:42,240
of your team will be um at wright's con

594
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,159
but um any final parting words that

595
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:46,080
you'd like to convey to the to the

596
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,440
delegates that are

597
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,600
here for the opening of rightscon in its

598
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,120
11th edition

599
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,360
oh thank you brett to close my words

600
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:55,120
would be simple and it's just simply to

601
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,840
say thank you namahinuikiyokotokatoa

602
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,360
new zealand for the critically important

603
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:04,320
work that you're doing it is critical

604
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,480
and this particular juncture that we're

605
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,559
at now more than ever it's so important

606
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,320
that we work together

607
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,480
and i see all of you as being a playing

608
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
a critical role

609
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,080
uh we all have to be at the table we

610
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,320
won't find the solutions otherwise

611
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,039
thank you so much

612
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,200
such an interesting conversation and we

613
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,360
have brett solomon executive director of

614
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,600
access now joining us in the studio

615
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,159
brett of all the leaders out there i

616
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,799
wonder why did rightscon reach out to

617
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,720
her well i think you can see from what

618
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,200
she said the importance of civil society

619
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,880
the way in which

620
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,960
governments need to listen as well as

621
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
speak

622
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,960
and act

623
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:45,760
that

624
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,120
decision makers need to think

625
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,960
intentionally

626
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,799
you know she talked about human rights

627
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:53,200
which is so essential to the development

628
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,600
and of technologies around the world and

629
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,440
their application i think she's the

630
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,039
perfect choice but as i said like we're

631
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,720
looking forward to more uh heads of

632
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:04,000
state uh we've got 64 governments in uh

633
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,679
attending rights con this year so

634
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,440
there's a lot of heads of state to to

635
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
attend and to participate and to listen

636
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,600
to this community which is so vital

637
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,400
so interesting and of course i know that

638
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,520
uh

639
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,919
wright's khan really wants to impress on

640
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,919
everyone that diversity of events that's

641
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,000
going to be happening over the next week

642
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,320
and what better way to do that by

643
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,480
starting out with some music right scott

644
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,520
is so excited to present to you amel

645
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:33,360
matluthi she is a tunisian musician

646
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,320
and

647
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,480
many of you may remember her from over a

648
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,120
decade ago uh when um

649
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,440
she one of her songs became an anthem

650
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,360
for the tunisia revolution

651
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,960
and uh again so excited her latest album

652
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,200
came out in the last two years and we

653
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:52,720
present to you amel matluthi

654
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
hi everybody welcome to rightscon the

655
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,400
world leading summit on human rights in

656
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,720
the digital age i'm very happy to be

657
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,520
here to share some of my music and my

658
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,679
words with this community

659
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,480
i chose two very significant songs from

660
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,559
my repertoire to songs that represent

661
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,760
a lot of

662
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,880
hope and freedom

663
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,720
to me um

664
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,159
in a world

665
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:23,760
um like the world we're in today a world

666
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,480
where human life is less worth than

667
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:28,240
profit

668
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,360
human life is less worse than political

669
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,480
greed

670
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,520
in a world where oceans are full of oil

671
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,880
and plastic

672
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,080
in a world where our forests are burning

673
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,919
our planet is heating

674
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:42,799
and

675
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,720
our children

676
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,279
men and women drown at sea trying to

677
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,080
reach an impossible coast

678
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,039
to dream for a better future

679
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,480
i think

680
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,159
in this world

681
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,440
the best we have is art and music

682
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,039
to light our path and fill it with

683
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,120
hopes and dreams and freedom and truth

684
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,960
so that maybe we could build a better

685
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,720
and

686
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,840
more beautiful tomorrow

i i wanted to ask you i think this is

729
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,799
really the first time that

730
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,679
the world has woken up to the power of

731
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:57,760
technology um and uh its impact on

732
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,240
combat and conflict from ai to

733
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,960
disinformation and to cyber attacks can

734
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:05,039
you give us a sense of how important

735
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,279
tech is to your efforts to both respond

736
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,760
to the attack and also hopefully also to

737
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,240
achieve peace

738
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:14,480
um

739
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,919
thank you so

740
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
as we continue to repeat

741
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,120
modern war needs or requires modern

742
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,240
solutions

743
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,840
from the first day of war

744
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:29,600
realized that we needed to come up with

745
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,320
a completely new strategy to counter

746
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,720
russian military aggression

747
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,279
it is also very important to understand

748
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:39,200
that this is the war between past and

749
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,240
the future the past is full of military

750
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,880
equipment clamsy tanks and outrageous

751
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:48,399
lies and the future is about technology

752
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:51,039
therefore the new military strategy must

753
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,279
include new digital solutions

754
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
and i would say that our ministry

755
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,200
ministry of digital transformation of

756
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,600
ukraine did a lot of homework prior to

757
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,720
the war and by homework i mean since the

758
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,480
establishment of the ministry in

759
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:06,640
september 2019

760
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,640
we started to develop a digital

761
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,360
infrastructure that would help to build

762
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,640
a digital state so only in the two and a

763
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:18,480
half years we've covered 97 of ukraine

764
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,039
with high speed fixed internet we

765
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,480
started a tech educational reform and

766
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,960
almost 2 million of ukrainians went

767
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,760
through a basic digital literacy program

768
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:32,559
we started the reform of cyber sector

769
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,960
which has contributed a lot to our cyber

770
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,039
security and of course we were

771
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:40,159
developing digital public services so

772
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,679
in 2020 we've launched dia mobile

773
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,080
application which is now used by 17

774
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,240
million of ukrainian people and we have

775
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,679
also developed a special web portal dia

776
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,640
so our citizens can get access to

777
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:56,960
electronic documents digital signature

778
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,320
tools and over 80 governmental services

779
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,120
online and this all together because

780
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
became really a solid basis for

781
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,880
ukrainian resistance on cyber frontline

782
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,679
and when the war started on the 24th of

783
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:14,960
february we had to adjust our work

784
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:17,679
really very quickly and those previous

785
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:20,559
achievements with building di ecosystem

786
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:23,039
with building digital infrastructure

787
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
really helped us a lot because after

788
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,000
taking some time and by some time i mean

789
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:30,000
a couple of days right

790
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,279
to find some safe places we continue to

791
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:35,760
develop new services in the application

792
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,000
for example we have developed very

793
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,559
quickly the service which is an

794
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,559
assistance to the army which is an

795
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:44,720
opportunity to transfer funds to the

796
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:47,600
army or an e-support program which is a

797
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,320
financial assistance for people from

798
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:54,159
regions where an existence for example

799
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,200
yeah yeah

800
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
can i interject a little bit because

801
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,880
you've talked so much about the the

802
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,559
information gathering but there's always

803
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,159
of course a double-edged sword with this

804
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,640
kind of technology uh collecting data

805
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,519
about the citizens for example uh worked

806
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,440
very well in peace time but then in

807
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
wartime there's always the danger for

808
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,840
example that an opponent an opponent the

809
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:14,880
russians

810
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,240
would get in

811
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,240
information and data on the citizens so

812
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:20,720
how have you dealt with that and if i

813
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,640
may also add uh one thing we're

814
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:25,760
particularly curious about is

815
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:27,279
we've been reading that the ukrainian

816
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,919
government has used the services of an

817
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:33,279
american company a clear view ai

818
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,399
one of the primary reasons has been

819
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,559
to id

820
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:41,200
dead killed russian soldiers in order

821
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,399
for your government

822
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:45,279
uh for people to inform the next of kin

823
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,679
now i can well imagine that for

824
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,840
humanitarian reasons that is that is a

825
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,039
good thing

826
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,519
but of course whenever we use technology

827
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:55,440
it's very complicated

828
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,600
one question for example is what if you

829
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,480
id the wrong person and so you just

830
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,720
mentioned that there's

831
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,480
you had to make a lot of decisions on a

832
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,720
lot of things in a short amount of time

833
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,720
and i wonder what kind of ethical

834
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,519
questions were you considering with both

835
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,039
clearview ai use and also as you said um

836
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,760
the data of protecting the data of

837
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,559
ukrainian citizens

838
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,640
yes thank you very very important

839
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,279
questions so uh first of all we are

840
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:27,840
using the most creative and high-tech

841
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,720
solutions and among them using ai in the

842
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,360
process of the identification of russian

843
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,760
soldiers as you have mentioned

844
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,559
and it is important for us as it serves

845
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:41,519
two different goals the first one is to

846
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,919
inform relatives in russia on the real

847
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,240
situation in ukraine by spreading the

848
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,360
truth

849
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:50,559
and also by creating a database of work

850
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:53,360
criminals which will be used later on by

851
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,320
international court when time comes

852
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,679
and uh

853
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,720
we also have united the forces of

854
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,440
different international companies and we

855
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,559
have done lots of media campaigns uh

856
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:09,119
which cost millions and millions to try

857
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:12,639
to inform and to show the photos to show

858
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,440
the right messages to russian people

859
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,599
hoping that you know they will see it

860
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,359
they will see the truth and they will go

861
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,719
to protest and they will will um

862
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,960
they will go to the streets and they

863
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,960
will have their voice and they will try

864
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,560
to stop this work

865
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,760
and

866
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,960
definitely uh this this instrument is

867
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:35,679
very important for us uh right now and

868
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:39,199
as for the cyber security issues

869
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:42,000
so um it is also very important to

870
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,440
mention that

871
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:45,560
uh russia has been attacking

872
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:48,560
governmental web sources very actively

873
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,399
since 2014 and before we never have

874
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,480
responded to the attacks we only

875
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,320
defended ourselves

876
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,960
but literally a week before the start of

877
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,680
the war on the 15th of february we

878
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,839
experienced the largest cyber attack in

879
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,079
the history of ukraine millions of

880
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,560
dollars were spent on it we managed to

881
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,480
deal with it and eliminates the

882
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,160
consequences for government and

883
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:14,480
information resources thank you so much

884
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,119
for that and i think uh it's essential

885
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,880
that we do understand the importance of

886
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,520
connectivity um to conflict you know

887
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,359
access now runs to keep it on coalition

888
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:25,520
we spend a lot of time tracking internet

889
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:29,040
shutdowns and also cyber attacks as well

890
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,079
your minister requested that um that the

891
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:34,400
russian internet be you know broken

892
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,720
broken off from the the international

893
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,880
internet and you know this idea about

894
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,359
how do not just ukrainians but also how

895
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:43,520
do russians

896
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,200
oppose the war and how do they connect

897
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:46,720
with you know to show that there's

898
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,599
actually disagreement with putin

899
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,440
how important do you think connectivity

900
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:54,000
is for ukraine but also for the citizens

901
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,160
of russia

902
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,920
i know it's a difficult question and i i

903
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,359
don't mean to put you on the spot but i

904
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,200
think one of the things that's really

905
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,240
clear here is that often human rights

906
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,000
are the first victim

907
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,760
of warfare you know whether it be the

908
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:11,520
right to privacy the right to freedom of

909
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,359
expression the right to

910
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,320
association and so you know as we enter

911
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:19,200
into this whole new field this whole new

912
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,760
realm where technology technology is an

913
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:23,280
essential part of conflict and an

914
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,200
essential part of war

915
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
how do you feel that how do you how do

916
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,880
we protect rights in this context

917
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,800
well you see i think that uh you cannot

918
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:39,200
put these two questions together in one

919
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:42,320
uh the thing is that we have a

920
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,160
word time now here

921
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,480
so there is an aggressor who is

922
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,560
literally killing our

923
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:49,920
people

924
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,680
raping our women and i know this

925
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,079
conference is not about this but since

926
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:56,079
you're asking about the importance of

927
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,480
human rights and connectivity icon i

928
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,160
can't uh

929
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:01,920
just not mention it

930
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,280
so uh

931
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,520
we have an aggressor and i think that

932
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,880
the policy in the word time and in the

933
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:11,599
peaceful time

934
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,760
should have a difference because when

935
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,920
you have an aggressor you have to defend

936
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,960
yourself with all possible measures of

937
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,400
course it is very important to um you

938
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,480
know um

939
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:28,000
to do everything under the uh the the

940
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,599
convention uh statute of course but

941
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:34,320
nevertheless the first thing is to

942
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,400
defend our people

943
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,960
with all possible ways yeah i appreciate

944
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,280
that i think you know many of us i mean

945
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
there are many conflicts happening

946
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,880
around the world obviously ukraine is

947
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,960
very much on the agenda i think people

948
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,800
who are experiencing both hot and cold

949
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:50,400
conflicts are seeing the role of

950
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,240
technology and seeing the the kind of

951
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,320
trade-offs that have to happen um of

952
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:57,040
course we appreciate the the situation

953
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,280
in ukraine you know about it much better

954
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,079
than we do um i i

955
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:04,720
i want to also acknowledge as i say many

956
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:06,160
of the other conflicts that are taking

957
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,520
place around the world because i think

958
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,119
that and we're going to hear from a few

959
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,920

993
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:41,040
um as an afghan journalist and an afghan

994
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:43,920
woman i am living my worst nightmares

995
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,440
knowing that millions of women in

996
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,680
afghanistan are deprived of their basic

997
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:49,839
human rights solely on the basis of

998
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,599
their sex

999
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,480
since the taliban take over and take

1000
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:56,880
over afghanistan on august 15 they have

1001
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,680
waged war on the woman of afghanistan

1002
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,240
they are systematically trying to erase

1003
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,880
women from society effectively imprison

1004
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,720
them in their own houses

1005
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,880
the taliban have banned women from

1006
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,920
almost all job from secondary education

1007
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,480
traveling and sometimes even walking to

1008
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,720
the market without the male chaperone

1009
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:18,720
last month the taliban issued a degree

1010
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,720
requiring women

1011
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,880
including female anchors on the tv to

1012
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,119
cover their face when in public or on

1013
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,359
television screen if women fail to

1014
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:29,599
comply their male guardians will be

1015
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:32,079
punished afghanistan was already the

1016
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:34,319
worst country to be a woman but the

1017
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:36,480
taliban's policies are making survival

1018
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,440
impossible women and girls are already

1019
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,599
bearing the brunt of economic crisis and

1020
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:43,839
hunger in the country and now their dead

1021
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,839
bodies are being found all across the

1022
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:48,000
country tempo side is in the rise in

1023
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,160
afghanistan women who dare to protest

1024
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,880
the taliban have been beaten abducted in

1025
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:55,280
prison and some of them are being found

1026
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,480
dead

1027
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,560
afghanistan is now a woman's right

1028
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:00,880
crisis and the women of afghanistan need

1029
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,040
your support and solidarity in their

1030
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,280
struggle for their basic human rights

1031
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,079
please don't be bystanders to the

1032
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,839
subjugation and operation of women in

1033
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:12,160
afghanistan women of afghanistan are

1034
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,800
human and they deserve their rights to

1035
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:18,240
education war freedom to be respected to

1036
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,319
be protected

1037
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:21,760
to stand for women's rights in

1038
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,319
afghanistan we can all start by calling

1039
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:26,240
on our governments to sanction the

1040
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
taliban and the countries that are

1041
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,839
supporting the building of a gender

1042
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:32,240
apartheid regime in afghanistan make

1043
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,640
your voice heard and make this man make

1044
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
sure the world knows that you don't

1045
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,640
understand cooperation and subjugation

1046
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,520
of women anywhere in the world

1047
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:44,079
so that is my take on really what's

1048
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:46,240
happening in afghanistan and i'm happy

1049
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,160
and we have any questions nellie's a

1050
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,800
friend to answer yeah zara i'm i am

1051
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,720
wondering how you're able to continue

1052
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,880
doing your work are you using technology

1053
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,800
what kind of technology are you using to

1054
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,119
get information in afghanistan and to

1055
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,119
communicate to those there and how are

1056
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:03,040
you disseminating and spreading the

1057
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:06,000
stories that you're working on

1058
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,920
thank you so the way i am working is

1059
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:10,240
that mainly through telecommunication

1060
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:13,440
and internet i get access so i have a

1061
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:15,200
network of women journalists and other

1062
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,480
journalists in afghanistan that i

1063
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,280
connect with them and also we try to use

1064
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,760
mainly social media to reach people to

1065
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,680
know what's happening in the country and

1066
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:26,000
find ways to connect with them so so far

1067
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,520
we have access to internet and

1068
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,119
telecommunication

1069
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:32,160
but we are not hundred percent sure how

1070
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:34,720
this these platforms are secure or how

1071
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,200
the taliban can access them so we are

1072
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,520
also worried for other

1073
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,359
female journalists and other and male

1074
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,560
journalists in the country who are

1075
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,960
currently working especially with the

1076
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,839
security and the taliban trapping

1077
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:50,240
their system their phones this is a this

1078
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,319
is our concern

1079
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:54,880
um i'm also curious do you know if women

1080
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
who are not able to access education

1081
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,200
very quickly here how are they doing it

1082
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,440
are some of them going online perhaps

1083
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
and and taking courses that are

1084
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,720
available overseas it is interesting

1085
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,760
because i think

1086
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,920
one of the considerations both here in

1087
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,680
afghanistan but also

1088
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:11,520
globally where we're seeing many of

1089
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:13,359
these conflicts is the diaspora is the

1090
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,079
fact that you know many um journalists

1091
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,240
are having to and civil society having

1092
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,200
to to flee and you know the situation is

1093
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,000
the same uh obviously in afghanistan the

1094
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:25,200
other thing that i think reflects as

1095
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,560
well across both countries that we've

1096
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,240
just heard from is the issue of gender

1097
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,720
and i'm really pleased that access now

1098
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,440
and rightscon is um putting this firmly

1099
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,520
on the agenda human rights abuses online

1100
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:38,400
and offline are gendered often and so it

1101
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,440
would be great to hear some of the sort

1102
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:40,720
of workarounds in terms of that

1103
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:43,119
education issue for sure

1104
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:45,520
yes we do actually have a lots of uh

1105
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,520
afghan diaspora and also afghan

1106
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,760
educators teachers and activists inside

1107
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,079
the country setting up from the very

1108
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:54,400
early days setting up their own ways

1109
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:57,119
like mainly online education for girls

1110
00:43:57,119 --> 00:43:59,839
however the main problem is there is a

1111
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:02,240
little access so the the afghans who

1112
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,640
have access to technology and internet

1113
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,680
are um very very limited yeah right

1114
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:09,760
and they don't have so the main problem

1115
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:12,160
is not all people who they don't have

1116
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:14,400
access to technology internet to be able

1117
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,720
to continue their education online um

1118
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,960
zara nader thank you so much for joining

1119
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:21,440
us we really appreciate it

1120
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:24,319
thank you for having me

1121
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,240
and now we pivot to the philippines um

1122
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,079
we are speaking feels like a story of

1123
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,760
whoa all over the place and i think one

1124
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,280
of the just as we we do move to a very

1125
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,880
important story in the philippines i

1126
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:39,040
think it's important to note

1127
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:40,640
as well just the power and the

1128
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,200
resilience of civil society like whilst

1129
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,119
all of these conflicts are happening you

1130
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,880
know that way in which the community is

1131
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,400
rising i've been thinking about civil

1132
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,720
society on the rise as a kind of theme

1133
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,640
for writicon for this year because it is

1134
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:55,200
so impressive the way that um you know

1135
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,400
people like sarah and um our previous

1136
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,680
singer have you know really inspired us

1137
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,440
uh and their communities to be able to

1138
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,599
move forward in the context of so many

1139
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:07,680
different issues that they're facing

1140
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,440
because it's so easy to think of the

1141
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,359
glass half empty and worry about

1142
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:14,160
authoritarianism and so on and so forth

1143
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,640
so no it's a really really good point

1144
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,400
and so we turn to a very a serious um

1145
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:23,040
situation here with a myleene caballona

1146
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,280
she is the leader of an organization

1147
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,319
called the bpo industry employees

1148
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,880
network that's a mouthful bien and the

1149
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:32,960
organization is basically a union

1150
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:34,960
representing those in what's called the

1151
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,440
business process outsourcing sector so

1152
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,720
bpo essentially call centers and you're

1153
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:42,400
probably wondering what that has to do

1154
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,800
with the human rights summit but it gets

1155
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,359
pretty uh tough and scary uh pretty

1156
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:50,160
quickly uh mileen and her colleagues um

1157
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:52,160
are are the victims of a disinformation

1158
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:54,960
and misinformation campaign online uh

1159
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,920
online trolls supporters of uh

1160
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:59,599
of the president over the last few years

1161
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,599
rodrigo duterte

1162
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,560
attacked them uh saying that they are

1163
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,720
terrorists saying they are communists

1164
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:09,359
and these are very serious accusations

1165
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,520
uh civil society activists in the

1166
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:14,560
philippines have been killed dozens of

1167
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,800
them over the years and

1168
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,960
as a result sometimes for example i

1169
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,599
understand myleene has to

1170
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,160
go into hiding or not be very clear

1171
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,119
where she's operating from so myleene

1172
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:29,920

yeah that was a little introduction but

1176
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,680
can you debrief us a little bit more

1177
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,079
about your situation

1178
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,400
uh yeah i actually have a short briefer

1179
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:44,240
if you'd like so you'd have an idea as

1180
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,839
to what's going on in the country

1181
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,760
absolutely

1182
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,319
yes so um yeah i'm from the bpo industry

1183
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:52,640
employees network we're call center

1184
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,040
employees we have come together to claim

1185
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,680
our rights and uphold our welfare we

1186
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,240
have formed the biggest organization in

1187
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,240
our sector the bpo industry employs

1188
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,160
network or bien

1189
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,920
we have asserted that the boom in the

1190
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,000
sector should mean the protection of our

1191
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,240
rights and welfare through the years we

1192
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:12,560
have waged many campaigns and advocacies

1193
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,599
for this

1194
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:15,359
now through painstaking work we have

1195
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:17,920
formed the first enterprise-based union

1196
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,000
in the industry the unified employees of

1197
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,160
alarica we have also conducted

1198
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,160
widespread consultation to come up with

1199
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,160
the bpa over chris welfare act and have

1200
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,400
it filed in the philippine congress we

1201
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,240
have also worked with the

1202
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:32,400
uh biens affiliation with the uni global

1203
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:34,400
union to strengthen solidarity to our

1204
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,040
struggle but we have faced many

1205
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,800
challenges under the authoritarian

1206
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:41,920
presidency of rodrigo 230 of course we

1207
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:44,079
have been repeatedly labeled by the

1208
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:46,800
government as communist terrorist fronts

1209
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,480
simply because we are

1210
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,000
very very

1211
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,480
vocal and often critical

1212
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,359
in our country such accusations

1213
00:47:55,359 --> 00:47:56,960
go hand in hand with human rights

1214
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,280
violations one of our organizers

1215
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,240
actually was arrested and jailed on the

1216
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:05,440
basis of trump of charges this was 2019

1217
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:07,119
and thanks to our campaign and to

1218
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:09,520
overwhelming support and solidarity miss

1219
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:12,640
ann kruger our organizer is now free on

1220
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,160
uh on bail

1221
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,920
now one of the ways that the philippine

1222
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,319
government spreads this labeling or red

1223
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:21,359
tagging is through social media mostly

1224
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,960
facebook and twitter

1225
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,680
numerous facebook accounts and pages

1226
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:27,520
have been spreading these dangers and

1227
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,599
deadly lies to the public together with

1228
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:31,599
other messages that poison public

1229
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:32,720
discourse

1230
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,720
and eliminate democratic discourse in

1231
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,280
favor of the government and we see such

1232
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:39,280
threats and repression continuing under

1233
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,440
the new presidency of ferdinand marcus

1234
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,920
jr the son of the former dictator and

1235
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,720
the turkish ally and of course we vow to

1236
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:48,640
continue fighting for our rights and

1237
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:50,240
welfare and thus contributing to

1238
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,559
democracy and of course we look forward

1239
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,040
to and are very thankful to your

1240
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,440
continued solidarity

1241
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,200
thank you and thanks so much for your

1242
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,920
comments and and also you know for your

1243
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,800
hard work in very serious circumstances

1244
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,839
obviously you're looking for allies um

1245
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:10,240
those who can support you across civil

1246
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:12,400
society but also within the tech sector

1247
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:15,040
and i'm wondering whether facebook and

1248
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:17,599
amazon and verizon and others are

1249
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,880
actually

1250
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,839
helping um to articulate the concerns

1251
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:23,440
helping to provide you with some

1252
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,599
protections what's the relationship that

1253
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:27,280
you're having with with the private tech

1254
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:28,720
sector

1255
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,960
actually that's a very good question

1256
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:31,760
this

1257
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:35,440
big companies um are hiring uh people in

1258
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,400
the philippines through third parties

1259
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,440
and we try to as much as possible reach

1260
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:43,760
out engage with these third parties

1261
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:46,319
through social dialogues but to no avail

1262
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:49,119
of course um we are a labor association

1263
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:50,960
but we're not a union so we don't have

1264
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:53,280
any bargaining power and our industry is

1265
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:55,920
highly none you know none unionized and

1266
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:58,240
we proved i think most companies prefer

1267
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,920
it like that

1268
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:01,760
so we basically don't have any

1269
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:03,599
protection from that yeah it's really

1270
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:05,280
interesting because you know many of us

1271
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:06,720
who have been involved in the issues

1272
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,040
around content moderation you know from

1273
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,800
afghanistan to ukraine we're talking

1274
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,480
about you know

1275
00:50:12,480 --> 00:50:14,240
content that incites violence leads to

1276
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,319
genocide etc and we've been saying we

1277
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:18,160
don't want the algorithm to determine

1278
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,839
the legality or otherwise a speech we

1279
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:22,160
want people to do so this is the flip

1280
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,400
side of that i think we really need to

1281
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,119
be conscious of the labor conditions and

1282
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:28,559
of the human rights of those who are in

1283
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,319
the content moderation

1284
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:33,440
world um and so yeah i think and again

1285
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,599
it's a gendered issue as well so

1286
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,119
absolutely and hopefully through

1287
00:50:37,119 --> 00:50:39,280
writescon you can actually find somebody

1288
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,520
at facebook or others to connect many of

1289
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:44,000
the companies there's 560 odd companies

1290
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:46,880
that are present uh at writes con um

1291
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,200
we're more than happy to help facilitate

1292
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,880
a conversation with some of those big

1293
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:52,640
companies and with the governments as

1294
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,599
well so um yeah please stay tuned it's

1295
00:50:55,599 --> 00:50:58,800
desperately appreciated

um you know brett that was the last

1302
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,680
interview of the opening ceremony i know

1303
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,599
that we've kind of ricocheted around the

1304
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:16,640
world

1305
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,000
zoomed in to afghanistan ukraine

1306
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:23,040
new zealand the philippines um where's

1307
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,800
next well i think you know this there

1308
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:27,119
are so many sessions throughout the week

1309
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:28,880
that um are

1310
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,680
focused on particular countries many of

1311
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:34,160
the issues across regions uh across

1312
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:36,240
sector groups etc this is one of the

1313
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,480
beauties of rights con

1314
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,720
i think we should also mention

1315
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,720
myanmar many of the human rights

1316
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:44,800
defenders from myanmar have contacted us

1317
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:46,960
asked if we could raise um

1318
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:48,800
their plight in the opening ceremony

1319
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:51,359
which i think is absolutely essential

1320
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:52,880
and the last two weeks have been

1321
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,240
horrendous

1322
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,119
for the burmese the people of myanmar

1323
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:59,680
who have engaged and who have had to

1324
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,800
engage

1325
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,280
with internet shutdowns again you know

1326
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:05,440
human rights abuses have taken place

1327
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,440
under the shroud of darkness which is

1328
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:09,119
extremely concerning and something that

1329
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:11,760
we've seen around the world and one last

1330
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:13,359

00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:31,920
in full knowledge that he would face a

1339
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:34,720
military tribunal back then in 2011 he's

1340
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,599
been pretty much in detention uh in

1341
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,559
prison since since then and i'd like to

1342
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,240
just like this past decade yeah the last

1343
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:43,440
decade so we should think about what

1344
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,839
we've all done for the last decade

1345
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,359
i'd like to play a cliff just for one

1346
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,079
minute which looks at allez's keynote

1347
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,319
speech from silicon valley back in 2011

1348
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,730
alex the floor is yours

1349
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,280
[Applause]

1350
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,079
hi

1351
00:52:58,079 --> 00:52:59,040
um

1352
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,680
let me just um take 30 seconds off topic

1353
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:03,200
and talk about

1354
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:05,359
extraordinary justice which is what i'm

1355
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:08,240
going to be facing military prosecutors

1356
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,079
there's obviously no due process

1357
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,240
civilians shouldn't be facing that i

1358
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,760
urge you

1359
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,839
to find ways to stand in solidarity with

1360
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:18,480
anyone who is facing extraordinary

1361
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,359
justice you've um you've had your share

1362
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:24,319
of it with the guantanamo detainees here

1363
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:26,160
in this country

1364
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:28,160
so if you care about human rights you

1365
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,440
know what it's like and you know why

1366
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,599
it's important there are 12

1367
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:34,000
around 12 000 civilians in egypt who are

1368
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,160
currently in military prison

1369
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,599
um

1370
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:38,559
most

1371
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:40,079
some of them for participating in the

1372
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:43,200
revolution that the military

1373
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,119
pretends to have protected and sided

1374
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:48,720
with some for very minor

1375
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,280
offenses mostly they're being randomly

1376
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,760
detained around major events in which it

1377
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,280
is the military who has committed the

1378
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:58,160
crimes and not the civilians

1379
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,559
so i urge you to find ways to stand in

1380
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:02,400
solidarity with anyone who is facing

1381
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:06,079
extraordinary justice thank you

1382
00:54:09,359 --> 00:54:11,599
yeah and you can see what a beautiful

1383
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,839
powerful and important

1384
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:16,640
actor blogger software developer that he

1385
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,599
is

1386
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,200
but two things have changed since then

1387
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,599
um one in the last year he's become a

1388
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:23,760
british citizen through his mother

1389
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,640
and secondly uh ale is also

1390
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:28,319
on a hunger strike i think he's on day

1391
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:29,760
66

1392
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,920
which is extraordinary

1393
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:34,079
we've met with the his family has met

1394
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:35,680
with the uk foreign office to try and

1395
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,520
gain consular access which the egyptian

1396
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:40,319
government is currently denying

1397
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,319
and we have also met with the foreign

1398
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,240
office myself actually last two weeks

1399
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:45,760
ago in london

they have been working to try to get

1401
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:50,000
access and for him to be released and we

1402
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,160
call upon the uk foreign office to

1403
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:54,079
continue in its efforts at its highest

1404
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,680
levels levels not just to have him

1405
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:57,119
released but also at this point i would

1406
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,599
say to save his life so

1407
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:01,200

melissa before we wrap up i just wanted

1444
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,400
to remind

1445
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,000
everyone that we have a participant guy

1446
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,280
available

1447
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,440
which is a good resource that we've put

1448
00:58:29,440 --> 00:58:31,200
together to help everyone make the best

1449
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,200
out of the ridescon experience

1450
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,880
participants can find information on how

1451
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,400
they can set up their profile on the

1452
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,839
platform how

1453
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:39,599
they can set their time zones so they

1454
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,040
can see the sessions are happening in

1455
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:42,640
their own local time

1456
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:44,400
how they can build their personal

1457
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,520
personalized agenda

1458
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:49,359
there's also a really good information

1459
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:50,720
about like the types of sessions that

1460
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,799
we'll have this year for example we have

1461
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,760
panels fireside chats in conversation

1462
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,160
interviews that will have unlimited

1463
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,079
attendance

1464
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,240
whereas we have also workshops and

1465
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,880
community labs um in social hour formats

1466
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,640
which do have limited attendance so

1467
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,760
they're smaller exactly yeah um so these

1468
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:12,160
limited sessions they will close once

1469
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:14,720
they reach the participation cap but you

1470
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,640
know if participants aren't able to make

1471
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,160
it into a session of their choice into

1472
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,160
the first choice there's always going to

1473
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,680
be programming available that they can

1474
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:23,760
tune into for example lightning talks

1475
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,119
and tech demos which are available on

1476
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:27,440
the platform at all times

1477
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:29,680
yeah and one last thing to note is the

1478
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,359
help section that we have on the

1479
00:59:31,359 --> 00:59:32,640
platform

1480
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:34,240
there's very useful information there

1481
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,440
how to get in touch with us if

1482
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,520
participants have any questions uh

1483
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:39,359
whether they're general questions or any

1484
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:42,000
safety and security concerns um so we

1485
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:44,000
have dedicated teams that are there and

1486
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:46,640
