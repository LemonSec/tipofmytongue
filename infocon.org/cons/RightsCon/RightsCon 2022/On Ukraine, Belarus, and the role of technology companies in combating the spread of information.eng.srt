in what is widely considered europe's

17
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,559
last dictatorship he was arrested she

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:45,840
took his place unfortunately she had to

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,879
flee the country and go into exile while

20
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,120
hundreds of thousands of protesters in

21
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,360
belarus took to the streets in support

22
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,199
of her and against dictator luka shenka

23
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,520
her government in exile is demanding

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,280
fair and free elections in the country

25
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,920
of belarus and the release of political

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
prisoners including her husband

27
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,080
welcome madame zykonoskaya

28
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,439
hello everyone thank you for invitation

29
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,240
now rightscon is a summit that happens

30
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,960
at the intersection of human rights and

31
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,960
technology so i want to begin by asking

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,400
about how the people of belarus used

33
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,680
technology during your election campaign

34
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,920
and during the protests this is a

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,479
country with a lot of young coders and

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,759
engineers there's a startup scene and i

37
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:39,600
think a lot of people at wright's con

38
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,920
are super interested in how

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,000
the people of belarus leveraged

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,640
technology

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
so i i have to say that

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,439
technology plays huge role not only

43
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,000
during a played huge role not only

44
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
during our uprising but till now when we

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,320
continue our fight i think that in 2020

46
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,960
technology helped us to

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,199
mobilize and spread information you know

48
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,720
technology helped us to create a

49
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
platform for discussions and unleashed

50
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,640
creative campaigns and ideas you know

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,640
just just a few examples

52
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,400
in 2020 we collected thousands of

53
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
signatures for presidential candidates

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,239
and when our election was rigged we uh

55
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:30,959
organized alternative voting through the

56
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,080
platform hollas like clerk voice its

57
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,480
founder revealed

58
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,720
that i received three million votes and

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,200
lukashenka lost the election and we know

60
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
it thanks to

61
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,480
uh belarusians on the streets who

62
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,080
protested for

63
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,120
months but also thanks to technology

64
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,040
and through like

65
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,760
such platforms as telegram youtube and

66
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,400
other social media channels our people

67
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,599

68
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:02,800
movement against lukashenka uh people uh

70
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,200
neighborhoods volunteers collected

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,640
data on their detainees and other

72
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,599
other things also crowd funding

73
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
platforms became

74
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,400
the new state persons organized all the

75
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,200
support for hospitals during kovid and

76
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,799
for people when repressions began and it

77
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,720
shows how creative and united we are

78
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,680
also uh it's not about our uprising but

79
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,159
about the war against ukraine

80
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:39,040
when uh russia launched this war our

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,040
people uh sent

82
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,920
thousands of photos and videos every day

83
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,280
uh informing about

84
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,360
the movement of russian troops and

85
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:52,159
missiles launches and this information

86
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,040
like helped ukrainians prepare for uh

87
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,640
possible attacks or bombings and uh

88
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,879
worried russians you know who to some

89
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,319
extent didn't feel safe in our country

90
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:05,840
uh that lukashenka offered as a

91
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,400
launching pad for the war and it showed

92
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,200
once again that uh belarusians are

93
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,360
against the dictator they are against

94
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,480
the war

95
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,399
and also one of the our recent projects

96
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,120
uh it's digital belarus

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,320
that

98
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,800
will offer it's on the in

99
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,639
at the state of a project at the moment

100
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,720
but this service will

101
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,880
offer different online services for

102
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
biller sands and

103

uh will also work on electronic ids for

104
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,440
our people uh because now kashanka's

105
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,120
regime like

106
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,240
say that those who fled the country uh

107
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,000
like belarus doesn't need these people

108
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,160
anymore but we want to show that we are

109
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,199
united and uh just to through this

110
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,840
platform digital belarus to show how

111
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,919
many of us uh who are opposing the

112
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,639
regime for opposing the war

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,440
how is your government and how are you

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,280
sending messages to the people of

115
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,000
belarus inside the country

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
are the technology tools the

117
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,840
circumvention tools effective

118
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,560
so

119
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
of course

120
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,720
we are using

121
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,639
all the possible

122
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,000
all the possible

123
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,600

125
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,440
belarus uh

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
again we are using uh

127
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
youtube telegram channels uh

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,560
instagram everything that uh

129
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,039
regime can't block they can't block the

130
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
whole internet and we have to use every

131
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
opportunity to

132
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
give information to

133
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,919
people

134
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,680
but of course regime also uses

135
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,120
technologies in the same extent and

136
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,840
they have much more resources to put um

137
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,360
to put the

138
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,680
information on like advertisements on

139
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360

people can can

141

see it so it's extremely important now

142
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,639
for technology companies to

143
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,600

144
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,720
uh regime's uh propaganda you know to

145

several days and continued turning it

173
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,520
off during mass rallies on sundays uh in

174
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,000
the following months and persons were

175
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,199
disoriented and couldn't coordinate rail

176
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,840
as well there was also a lot of fear

177
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,919
among citizens because they didn't know

178
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:36,000
what was happening and of course

179
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,720
watching at style links i wish we also

180
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
had uh them you know back then and i

181
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,360
would say that

182
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,840
i would say today that we will need uh

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,560
to find a solution for future protests

184
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,840
and

185
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,319
media blackout and also i'm confident

186
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,440
that um tech companies and platforms

187
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,240
could help us spread information and

188
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,639
advanced democracy and bearers you know

189
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,120
our media and journalists have problems

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,080
with promoting content in birds and

191
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,120
language

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,800
sadly for

193
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,360
google you know it's easier to stop

194
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,400
supporting

195
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,919
less widely used languages than to build

196
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:17,759
a personal office

197
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,400
but paying attention to our language is

198
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,879
an important step you know to help

199
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,120
preserve our identity

200
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
also russian propaganda can reach our

201
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,400
people easier than uh the content from

202
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,279
belarus and independent media so a

203
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,279
separate like belarus segment is crucial

204
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,320
in

205
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:41,440
our fight uh also when we are

206
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,000
communicating with big tech companies we

207
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,200
are advocating for banning uh prolo

208
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,600
kashanka propaganda and the state

209
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,000
television channels from youtube because

210
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,720
they spread misinformation about the way

211
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
in ukraine and while russia propaganda

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,760
channels are banned

213
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,640
uh the regimes the regime keeps

214
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,519
promoting it

215
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,160
go ahead please please i'd like to hear

216
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,120
more

217
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,320
uh it's also crucial to counter internet

218
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,080
censorship and

219
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,800
like suppressing surveillance technology

220
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
which the regime uses to

221
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,080
control access to information we need

222
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,519
censorship circumvention tools and like

223
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,920
relevant software for use and this is

224
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,399
where big tech companies can be very

225
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,720
like useful and supportive to us yeah

226
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,560
and you mentioned earlier that belarus

227
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
can't entirely shut down all of the

228
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,120
internet off but we are seeing more and

229
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,959
more authoritarian states around the

230
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:45,200
world do exactly that um and so

231
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,320
are you concerned that long term

232
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
even as you try to

233
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,360
um send information to the people of

234
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,560
belarus that they will as you uh refer

235
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,399
to the amount of misinformation and

236
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,720
propaganda is far more

237
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,279
than what you're trying to push in terms

238
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,880
of information that eventually the

239
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
people of belarus

240
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,959
will very much like what's happened in

241
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:11,600
russia very much actually china is a

242
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,680
great example right china blocked

243
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,920
facebook and twitter more than a decade

244
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,680
ago and

245
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,920
you know the people there

246
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,399
it's they they believe the propaganda

247
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,720
many of them the majority of them and

248
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,200
the majority of russians seem to support

249
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,200
the war in ukraine because they they

250
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
don't know better are you worried about

251
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,600
the people in belarus the people who

252
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,519
support you now

253
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,880
eventually succumbing to propaganda over

254
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,640
the next few years over the next decade

255
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,760
uh you know i think that

256
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,440
i'm speaking on behalf of belarus that

257
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:51,200
person people know uh today how to get

258
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,200
alternative information of course the

259
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,120
older generation of people who don't

260
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,519
have access to internet or don't know

261
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,000
how don't want to study how to use it

262
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,079
they believe um

263
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,880
in state tv you know state propaganda

264
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,000
but more and more people are uh involved

265
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,720
into getting uh real information they

266
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,640
are looking for this information and of

267
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,600
course um it's very important to

268
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
uh

269
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,360
teach uh them how to

270
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,480
uh

271
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,800
circumvent all their uh

272
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,560
like

273
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,160
blockings you know that that regime can

274
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,839
control uh

275
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,839
media for example we

276
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:33,360
uh

277
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,160
people and builders know how to use vpn

278
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,959
and

279
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:39,600
other censorship circumvention tools so

280
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,720
uh what is important is to

281
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:45,920
help bloggers and journalists with the

282
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,640
equipment with the verification tools

283
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,120
you know for them to feel secure in this

284
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,760
internet space so i don't believe that

285
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,600
birds and people uh will start

286
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,959
you know to follow propaganda's channels

287
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,000
but it's very important it's crucial to

288
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,040
support alternative media for us to be

289
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,800
more vocal because we don't have you

290
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,000
know as as

291
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,720
democratic forces we don't have so

292
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,040
much

293
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,079
so much you know

294
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
how to say

295
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,079
so much uh

296
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,240
tools okay you know to

297
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,079
uh to

298
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,440
deliver information as propaganda has so

299
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,120
so much no experts but we believe that

300
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,800
modern technologists

301
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,279
will understand that it's a day task as

302
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,160
well to stop propaganda from spreading

303
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,720
their information but support uh those

304
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,519
forces those powers those people who

305
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
want to show the truth about the

306
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
situation in our country in ukraine and

307
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,000
you know all over the world

308
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,320
now you mentioned uh that you wish that

309
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,880
starlink had been there um have you been

310
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,440
in touch with elon musk about that and

311
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,320
also you talk about circumvention tools

312
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,000
and needing that help

313
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,079
how are you going about it uh do you

314
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,760
need to raise money um are you perhaps

315
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,399
talking to international ngos that work

316
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:20,240
in tech to do this in order to send

317
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,040
messages to belarus and keep that line

318
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,240
of communication open

319
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,760
now i suppose that after 2020 our local

320
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,720
i.t companies saw local ngos they tried

321
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,079
to reach elon musk but maybe at that

322
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,760
time uh

323
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,160
the russian problem wasn't um too

324
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,519
important for

325
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,680
uh this company

326
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,959
but

327
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
now seeing what's going on in ukraine

328
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
and that stalin provided them with

329
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,560
equipment we also

330
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
want to

331
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,560
get the same maybe access to

332
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,440
uh this equipment to this equipment

333
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:00,800
because

334
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,279
democratic values are common for all the

335
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:05,600
countries so

336
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
but as for technologists you know we

337
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,600
think that

338
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,920
in these difficult times for ukraine for

339
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,720
belarus uh it would be

340
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,519
very nice you know for

341
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,880
uh

342
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,320
for google

343
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,120
and

344
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,959
other different companies you know to

345
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,000
provide uh people who are fighting with

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,199
dictatorship for free so for us not

347
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
don't have necessity to

348
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,760
fundraise money to buy some equipment or

349
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,399
technologies uh because we have to

350
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,839
understand that we are fighting for the

351
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,800
same values for the values you have

352
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,839
in democracies but this is our common

353
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,279
force to

354
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,199
um

355
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,160
to get

356
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
more democratic countries into into this

357
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,160
family of democracies for free you know

358
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,120
we

359
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,120
really it's it's not necessary to get

360
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,839
money uh

361
00:14:56,839 --> 00:15:00,480
from people who are fighting for changes

362
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,800
um madame tsukuniskaya uh we have a lot

363
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
of questions coming in so i want to get

364
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,680
to them so uh i want to end our segment

365
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,600
with a question that's not related to

366
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,880
technology um you're the leader in exile

367
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,839
of belarus and i'm curious how you make

368
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:16,880
sure

369
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,680
over time that you don't become

370
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,399
a dissident in exile

371
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,480
you are a leader in exile right now how

372
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,720
do you make sure that you are not a

373
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
dissident in exile and what i mean by

374
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:31,360
that is that um

375
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,839
you know you have a small team

376
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,000
it's not a full government and we have

377
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,000
seen in the past other governments and

378
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,639
exiles over the decades sometimes fade

379
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,680
into

380
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,519
irrelevance

381
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,079
so i'm curious how your team talks about

382
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,638
the future

383
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,000
so our main task is to

384
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,440
stay in contact with the belarusians who

385
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,759
are in belarus who are fighting for the

386
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,920
future of our country and to stay in

387
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
contact with the uh

388
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,079
people with democratic forces who are in

389
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,720
exile and thanks again to technologists

390
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
to zoom conferences you know to

391
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,839
instagram we uh managing to

392
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
you know keep uh constant contact with

393
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
people in belarus so

394
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,720
and i see that

395
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,560
belarusians are

396
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
desperately fighting yes underground

397
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,639
like yes you don't see huge massive

398
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,519
rallies on the streets of uh uh our

399
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,160
builders and cities but this spirit of

400
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,360
freedom

401
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:35,680
is is alive in belarus sense and we

402
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,079
as people need energy

403
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,279
and every time when we see that

404
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,240
technology companies when our

405
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,720
politician forces

406
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,440
different ngos are helping us

407
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,959
on our way

408
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,639
we are

409
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,759
like

410
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,079
energizing ourselves we understand that

411
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,800
we are not abandoned that uh

412
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,600
we are not agreed with this regime we

413
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,680
are not agreed that our political

414
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,319
prisoners will spend years in jail for

415
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,400
just

416
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,439
being

417
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:12,240
being three people dead to to oppose the

418
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,280
regime

419
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,799
so

420
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:16,720
it's very important contact is very

421
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,160
important and thanks again to

422
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,839
technologists we are managing to keep

423
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,760
this contact with people

424
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,000
well that leads into our first question

425
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,799
from rob um are you more optimistic

426
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:29,039
about returning to belarus after seeing

427
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,480
how the war in ukraine has unfolded

428
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,160
uh look we understand that um

429
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,720
the fate of ukraine and fate of belarus

430
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,120
are interconnected and without free

431
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,280
ukraine there will be no free belarus

432
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,280
but without free belarus there will be

433
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,799
no uh

434
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:50,000
secure ukrainians secure western

435
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,799
countries uh so we understand that

436
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:56,960
belarus uh persian regime is a part of

437
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,039
regional problem and this problem has to

438
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,799
be solved in complex so i seen um

439
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:05,840
international support to ukraine seeing

440
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,600
how ukrainians uh are brave and courage

441
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,000
and seeing how belarusians are ready to

442
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,559
help ukrainians you know that a lot of

443
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,280
girls and men are fighting alongside

444
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,000
ukrainians i really believe that uh

445
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,200
ukraine will win this war and it will

446
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,600
give us persons one more window

447
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,760
opportunity to

448
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,760
get fruit of the regime and we are not

449
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,240
just sitting and waiting the outcome of

450
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,720
the war we are preparing for this period

451
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,280
before uh this trigger you know for this

452
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
wind opportunity we are helping

453
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
ukrainians on the one side but also

454
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,360
continue to fight the regime like

455
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:46,320
exhausting um

456
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,880
regime structures uh

457
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,799
economically politically and

458
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
strengthening uh civil society media

459
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
human rights defending centers so this

460
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,480
is our strategy now and uh

461
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
yes i i i don't just have hope i'm sure

462
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,200
that this regime will collapse uh with

463
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,440
the

464
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,799
because of belarus and people will

465
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:11,679
for

466
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:14,080
changing situation in belarus and for

467
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,880
support and solidarity we see from

468
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,520
our international partners

469
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,919
now is there space for civil societies

470
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,720
of belarus and russia to collaborate to

471
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,799
fight for the common goal of freedom for

472
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,440
their two countries and against the war

473
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,080
and repression of putin and lukashenka

474
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,760
that question comes from natalya

475
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,200
so for during the last two years

476
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,160
kashanka's regime deliberately ruined

477
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,720
all the ngos and belarus all the

478
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,320
alternative media you know to suppress

479
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,520
um

480
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
to suppress civil society but person

481
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,120
people manage to restore the activity in

482
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,919
exile yes is we are not in the country

483
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:58,640
and

484
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,200
most of uh most of leadership of

485
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,280
different companies are not in the

486
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,440
country but

487
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,880
our presence uh in belarus uh presence

488
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,760
of injuries you know is inevitable and

489
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,760
um

490
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,799
uh

491
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,039
we we we managed to

492
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,120
like as i said to communicate with

493
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:22,480
people so our our civil society is

494
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,679
blossoming i have to say uh yes not in

495
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,919
belarus yes it's extremely difficult

496
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,159
because uh regime doesn't know the

497
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,120
borders they ruined not only jewos now

498
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,360
they're ruining also

499
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,600
trade unions like

500
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,400
they want to shut shut up

501
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,600
everybody in in our country but they

502
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,840
will not succeed because you can

503
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,320
suppress people physically but you can't

504
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,200
stop revolution in people's minds it's

505
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,400
it's uh

506
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
people

507
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,080
like it was like people's awakening in

508
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,960
2020 and people will not go and sleep

509
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,159
again for for next uh for next to 10 20

510
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,600
years

511
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,600
the next question comes from anna and

512
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,679
she's wondering how people in belarus

513
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:09,679
fight for freedom of thought on the

514
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
internet we discussed this a little

515
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,520
earlier about

516
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,440
my question and concerns about how

517
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
people maintain freedom of thought over

518
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,159
the years and don't succumb to

519
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,840
propaganda can you talk a little bit

520
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,159
more about that

521
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,000
uh would you paraphrase the question you

522
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,320
know from eternity and better please

523
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,600
uh yeah um the question is how people

524
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,600
can um

525
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,520
how they participate on the internet

526
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,520
what kind of messages are they sending

527
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,159
out to maintain the channel of

528
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:43,360
communication and to continue the fight

529
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,159
against the dictatorship of lukashenko

530
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,000
so i guess um

531
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,960
you know what are people talking about

532
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,440
that that they can on telegram or when

533
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,280
they're when they're using the vpns what

534
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,799
are they talking about

535
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,000
in belarus to try to move things forward

536
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,320
to try to improve the situation to try

537
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:05,600
to fight against the dictatorship

538
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,360
so you know our

539
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,679
task is brothers and people to create

540
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,280
multiple points of pressure on the

541
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,760
regime so people talk about different

542
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
things you know

543
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,080
some people

544
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,240
communicate about sanction regime you

545
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,919
know people from belarus sent

546
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,000
information to

547
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,480
special telegram channels about how for

548
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,880
example regimes deconvention sanctions

549
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,080
and our task is to close the loopholes

550
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
some people

551
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,960
launch educational programs to

552
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,840
explain ordinary people who have been

553
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:42,240
living under dictatorship for 27 years

554
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,360
and don't even understand what democracy

555
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,880
is so people so our express educates

556
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,559
people who are democracies they give

557
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:54,559
examples of other countries they prepare

558
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,440
personal society for changing that

559
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,080
democracy is rather difficult and you

560
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
have to take responsibility for the

561
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,919
future of your country uh many people

tech skills themselves so

594
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,799
non-belarusians people who want to help

595
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,120
belarus if they have skills

596
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,760
that they want to volunteer

597
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:43,520
who do they contact who should they

598
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,520
contact

599
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,240
so uh the entry point can be

600
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,200
uh

601
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
the office

602
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,880
that is situated in venus at the moment

603
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:58,000
and we can provide any person who is

604
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,000
interested in volunteering with

605
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,640
necessary contacts depending on

606
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,559
what this person

607
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,919
wants or where this person wants to help

608
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,760
so there are plenty of companies but

609
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,400
maybe it will be the easiest to get

610
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,200
through office office atlantic honestly

611
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,200
great and more generally and question

612
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:21,679
from donna asks um

613
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,279
how can people

614
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,919
support the people of belarus so it

615
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,760
doesn't have to be technology related

616
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:30,080
but but in general what's the best way

617
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,440
to show support for you

618
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,600
so if you are talking about

619
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,439
ordinary people not politicians

620
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,600
the easiest way to show your solidarity

621
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,720
uh is to support political prisoners you

622
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,120
know write letters to our people behind

623
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,919
the bars because they are um

624
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:55,120
really isolated from uh

625
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,799
from the people and the latest is the

626
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,799
only source of information for them and

627
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,120
they are so grateful when they get uh

628
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:03,200
latest not only from belarus but also

629
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,240

uh people all over the world it gives

631
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
them assurance that they are not

632
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
abandoned that they are not forgetting

633
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,240
forgotten that people are fighting for

634
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,039
them

635
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,760

00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,120
subjects here um at wright's con

684
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,600
what would you tell people who sometimes

685
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,960
as activists

686
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,919
um

687
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,039
feel little hope or or feel tired

688
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:16,279
against the fight against

689
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:18,880
authoritarianism what advice would you

690
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:22,000
say to them

691
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,200
look i

692
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,120
maybe i don't lose hope

693
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,279
but i'm also very uh very often tired

694
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:34,720
and exhausted and sometimes you want to

695
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,720
forget about everything and live with

696
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,320
the autumnal life

697
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,520
but

698
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,880
every time

699
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,000
in my case i think about people who

700
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,880
sacrificed uh with their freedom some

701
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,120
with their lives to give us opportunity

702
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,600
to uh fight

703
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,080
think about the future generations you

704
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,840
have to understand that you fight for

705
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:59,120
democratic changes in is not in vain

706
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,200
that you your country your people

707
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
deserve better future and they deserve

708
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,840
to live

709
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,080
in the country that shares uh

710
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,399
common values with um

711
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:13,520
already democratic countries and

712
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,399
if you are losing hope uh communicate to

713
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,679
people who uh still have like inside

714
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,799
power who still believes and it will

715
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,760
give you a little bit more hope as well

716
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,120
so

717
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,919
there is no one single receipt

718
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,039
how to

719
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,039
restore your resources

720
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,279
but

721
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,320
believe that you are not alone

722
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,640
democratic countries are with you people

723
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,720

724
