00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:05,759
council they'll be discussing the

47
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,120
participation of emerging seafaring

48
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,759
space faring not seafaring nations in

49
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
the new space race and their decolonized

50
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,080
visions for the future of space

51
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,680
exploration

52
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,440
victoria over to you

53
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,160
thank you um it's such a pleasure to be

54
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,160
here uh especially on the last day of

55
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
writescon this is probably my third

56
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,759
rights kind of intended so it's been

57
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,960
such an honor to talk about space today

58
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:37,280
and i'm excited to be here with lama

59
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,440
who i actually first met in dubai at the

60
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:41,440
the this past october

61
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
during the space generation congress um

62
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,039
so so excited to be here and um before

63
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,400
we begin i just want to remind the

64
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,319
audience that as we're talking please

65
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,400
send in questions there will be some

66
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,120
time at the end for us to answer them

67
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:58,240
so lemma we have such little time so i

68
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,560
want to give you some space no pun

69
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
intended

70
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,520
to talk a little bit about ignition

71
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:06,720
kuwait and how it fits in your mission

72
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,360
fits in with kuwait's growing space

73
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,759
ambitions

74
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,560
thank you victoria so yeah ignition is a

75
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,039
youth space research and exploration

76
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,360
startup and it's currently the only

77
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,080
licensed best company in kuwait

78
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,479
as an actor in the private sector we aim

79
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,560
to involve the country in international

80
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
space efforts and hopefully motivate the

81
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,199
government to start taking the first

82
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,120
steps towards making kuwait as

83
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,000
space-faring nation

84
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,639
uh ignition is currently aspiring to

85
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,880
build and develop and operate an analog

86
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,360
martian habitat that utilizes kuwait's

87
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,680
unique environment

88
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,319
awesome um and this actually jumps into

89
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,720
my next question nicely talking about

90
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
habitation um

91
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,879
so when we talk about the decolonized

92
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,039
decolonization of space

93
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,199
two things come to my mind and the first

94
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,280
is something dr linda billings said

95
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,599
who's from the planetary society and she

96
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,599
said that in order to decolonize space

97
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,840
we need to change not only our practices

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,680
but our rhetoric around space and we

99
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,240
need to move more slowly carefully and

100
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,440
thoughtfully

101
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,680
and also dr claire nelson who just this

102
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,000
week during a past session she sort of

103
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,240
expressed her fear that we're creating a

104
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,039
new space faring future that brings in

105
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,360
the old economies of the past which

106
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,759
includes growth at all costs and has

107
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,160
proven detrimental to earth so with

108
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,080
these ideas and these fears in mind can

109
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,958
you talk a little bit about what

110
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:38,319
decolonization of space means to you

111
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,679
it's all about de constructing colonial

112
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,399
ideologies that we carried from our past

113
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
and could possibly make their way into

114
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,360
our future in space uh specifically the

115
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,320
moon

116
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,080
which is the destination to build

117
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,920
settlements for most space fairing

118
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,040
nations

119
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,160
we simply cannot have a moon with posts

120
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,760
that declare that

121
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,200
country x or company y owns this region

122
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,360
on the lunar surface

123
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,760
with the artemis missions being our next

124
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,920
big endeavor and a number of countries

125
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
joining the us to go back and settle on

126
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,279
the moon

127
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
as well as the russia and china

128
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,160
agreement to set a lunar base by the

129
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,519
2030s

130
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:22,000
we are closer than ever to the new age

131
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,720
of colonialism and the moon will be our

132
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,959
first target

133
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,720
yeah it's interesting you say that

134
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,320
because i think france actually is the

135
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,399
most recent um country to join the

136
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,720
artemis of course just this week

137
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,080
and like you said there's a number of

138
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,519
private companies

139
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,519
uh with missions to the moon in just the

140
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,360
next couple of years and most of these

141
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,240
companies are backed by the us china and

142
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:47,440
european nations and most of their goals

143
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,800
are to uh have resource extraction lunar

144
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,360
mining building a sustainable presence

145
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,519
and all of this in my mind makes it all

146
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
the more urgent that we sort of move

147
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,600
from this theoretical conversation

148
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,680
around

149
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,279
decolonization and actually move towards

150
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,839
more of an action-oriented conversation

151
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,760
which is starting to happen and pick up

152
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,240
some speed so i'm just wondering in your

153
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
opinion

154
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,040
what do you think is the most pressing

155
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,240
challenge here right now

156
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:19,760
so space is a strategic and competitive

157
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,040
domain um where big space powers thrive

158
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,839
against one another so we must defend

159
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,240
the freedom to operate in space and ban

160
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,000
the use of weaponry

161
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
um and when it comes to the moon the

162
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,399
most pressing challenge is colonization

163
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,200
uh

164
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,680
if we do not take action now i think

165
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
that it would be inevitable

166
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,440
um we know that most space-faring

167
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,120
nations are planning to have a presence

168
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,440
on the moon within the next decade

169
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,160
and the most likely region where humans

170
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
will be settling is the south pole

171
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,040
specifically the shackleton crater where

172
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,120
ice water can be found

173
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,279
and if all nations target the same

174
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:01,440
region then that would be a challenge

175
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,360
that's a yeah that's a very interesting

176
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,040
point because i think most of the

177
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
missions um funded by nasa the eclipse

178
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:09,440
missions uh which is the commercial

179
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,160
partners helping build lunar landers are

180
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,440
targeting the

181
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,079
southern region of the moon specifically

182
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,360
because of the availability of lunar ice

183
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,519
before we sort of move on to

184
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,959
talking about maybe the outer space

185
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,399
treaty could you just explain a little

186
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,640
bit more why that lunar ice is so

187
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,399
important

188
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:31,279
yeah so basically if we are planning to

189
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,760
have a settlement where astronauts could

190
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:38,160
be um settling on the moon for uh months

191
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
let's say

192
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,079
we do need water in order to do our

193
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:43,760
research to

194
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,000
make sure that you know even the

195
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,680
settlements are being built in the

196
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,800
proper way we need the ice water uh it

197
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,440
is the most essential element that we

198
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
have on the moon that's why you you

199
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,519
don't see that other

200
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,040
space companies

201
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,519
aim or strive to go to any other part of

202
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,720
the of the moon it's only the south pole

203
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,600
um

204
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,720
ice water is important uh

205
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,120
and yeah that's it

206
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
so

207
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,480
let's go back to talk a little bit about

208
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,079
how do we prevent

209
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,560
any one country or a handful of

210
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,959
countries or even mostly companies as

211
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,360
well um sort of

212
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,720
dominate this new era of space and as we

213
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,600
saw with the last uh big era of space

214
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,680
exploration we did get the outer space

215
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,760
treaty in 1967

216
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,839
that essentially stated the exploration

217
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
and use of space shall be carried out in

218
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,519
the interest of all countries outer

219
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,680
space is the province of all mankind

220
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,320
which today we would say humankind um

221
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,959
but so i'm wondering how do we update

222
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,000
that space treaty to fit this new age

223
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,240
and is there any significant movement

224
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,360
going on in that area

225
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
yeah so yeah the outer space uh treaty

226
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,639
was very effective and it regulated

227
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,040
space activity during the early stages

228
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,639
of space exploration

229
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,040
and still is to this very day

230
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,760
but we do need to reshape space policies

231
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,720
in order to meet global trends and the

232
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
dramatic increase of space ventures over

233
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,240
the past decade especially policies that

234
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,279
prevent armed space race

235
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,639
in this new age of colonialism and

236
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,040
we will have lunar presence within the

237
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,360
next few years which calls for an action

238
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,959
plan to prevent

239
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,680
colonization of the moon and we do need

240
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,760
to govern the shackleton crater just

241
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,240
like we mentioned previously

242
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,680
yeah

243
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,560
and as someone who's coming from

244
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,760
kuwait

245
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,040
which is

246
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:48,079
very sort of a baby and in the space

247
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,199
race

248
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,639
what are should countries like kuwait be

249
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:54,480
pushing for are they already getting

250
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,120
into the conversation um and like

251
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,519
coppola's for example at the un or do

252
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,120
you think they need to be more active in

253
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,839
the conversation

254
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:06,480
uh countries like kuwait you know just

255
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,279
this year kuwait joined the yuan corpus

256
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,440
and

257
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,320
we do not have any step towards having a

258
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,199
presence on the moon nor in space yet

259
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,360
that that would take probably

260
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:23,600
30 years to even start there but um i do

261
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
believe that we need to participate in

262
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,880
the u.n legal subcommittee and the

263
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,279
peaceful use outer space just to be able

264
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:34,800
to share our opinions on uh space

265
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,120
policies in general and and have a vote

266
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,040
on everything that happens there

267
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:40,240
um

268
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,839
we just started our uh our baby steps

269
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:46,800
just like you mentioned in that sector

270
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,320
but uh yeah there there are some aims to

271
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,720
just enlighten people on

272
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,040
uh the policies face policies and space

273
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,839
law

274
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,720
and we hope to do so throughout our seat

275
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,480
that is now a permanent in the ion

276
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,720
couples

277
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,760
are there specific barriers that

278
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,560
emerging space fairing nations have

279
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,160
when it comes to

280
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,000
doing more missions and getting more

281
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,320
involved with um space exploration today

282
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,040
uh definitely i mean for for kuwait it

283
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,160
is uh education uh education when it

284
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
comes to space and astronomy is not

285
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
available for everyone it's not even

286
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
available in universities here nor can

287
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,800
we get scholarships to study them abroad

288
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,519
so

289
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,759
it is a challenge for people to become

290
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:35,519
involved and it is even more challenging

291
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,079
to be specialized for individuals or

292
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:40,320
space enthusiasts to be specialized in

293
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,440
let's say space law or medicine or

294
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,199
architecture you know

295
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:48,160
um so the challenge when it comes to

296
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
kuwait is the awareness and knowledge

297
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
even

298
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:54,480
the government does still does not take

299
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,279
space seriously so that's the most

300
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,279
challenging thing when it comes to

301
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,360
kuwait but um there is a a tiny space

302
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:05,600
race that's going around in

303
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,839
the gulf

304
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,399
countries and hopefully kuwait was

305
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:12,160
is going to participate in that we know

306
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
that saudi arabia are having their

307
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,880
first steps towards going even to the

308
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,959
moon and

309
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,519
the uae already just sent a probe to to

310
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,360
mars and yeah these are these are

311
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,279
neighboring countries and kuwait will

312
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,440
eventually happen and join the space

313
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,000
race and yeah

314
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,240
and how important do you think that is

315
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,880
for the decolonization of space

316
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
um are we almost

317
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,320
i worry that we're we're already swaying

318
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,360
too far

319
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,120
towards repeating what we've done on

320
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,839
earth and space because a lot of the

321
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,519
activities that are happening in space

322
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:48,720
today and have been happening for

323
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,759
decades have been dominated by the us

324
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,720
china russia and a handful of european

325
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,000
countries

326
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,600
and i know with certain legal

327
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,120
restrictions

328
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,120
in the us for example u.s companies

329
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,600
can't really hire engineers that aren't

330
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,839
american or don't have green cards so

331
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,359
there is sort of a shutdown of the

332
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,640
talent there

333
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:09,599
so

334
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:10,880
what

335
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,760
how important is it that we get emerging

336
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,919
space faring nations into space

337
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,760
exploration now and also that we

338
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,199
encourage

339
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,359
local populations to study space and to

340
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,240
study space law

341
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,599
involving emerging space countries will

342
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,600
definitely

343
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,600
tune down the dominance of traditional

344
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,039
space players

345
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:36,080
and it will bring back the power balance

346
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
i guess

347
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
it will help when it comes to it will

348
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
encourage infrastructure the industry

349
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,720
the econo economic growth

350
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,039
many in many ways and shapes and forms

351
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,360
do a major emerging space countries help

352
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,760
these space race and

353
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,440
again we do not want to repeat the

354
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
mistakes that we've done in the previous

355
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
uh space race

356
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
the best way to do it is to involve

357
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,480
smaller countries

358
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
and just share their innovation and

359
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,559
their different techniques for for

360
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,400
example we know in kuwait we have the

361
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,160
drilling technique which is not

362
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,520
something very very

363
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,200
familiar in the space sector so we know

364
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
that as an emerging space country or

365
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,480
hopefully an emerging space country in

366
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:22,559
the future we will be able to

367
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,080
just share the knowledge that we have

368
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,960
when it comes to drilling

369
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,039
um this sort of leads me to the next

370
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,960
question that we wanted to touch on and

371
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,880
that was around

372
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,440
the benefits and the drawbacks of space

373
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,760
exploration um i know that there are a

374
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,640
lot of people who ask why are we

375
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,679
spending

376
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,480
money going to space and obviously the

377
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
quote-unquote billionaire space race has

378
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:49,039
not helped with this narrative so i'd

379
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:51,600
love for you to talk a bit about um and

380
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,000
dr danielle wood from space enabled at

381
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,400
mit has done a lot of discussion around

382
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,720
the benefits of space exploration and

383
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,720
space science specifically for the un's

384
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,200
sustainability development sustainable

385
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,280
development goals so i'm curious from

386
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,720
your perspective

387
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,080
what sdgs do you think space is vital

388
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
towards achieving

389
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:16,000
yeah so satellite data

390
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,559
services are

391
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:19,360
crucial

392
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:22,080
especially to people in remote areas

393
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,039
where they're there are limited access

394
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,480
to affordable and clean energy and food

395
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,799
data on hydrosphere the biosphere the

396
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,039
atmosphere collected from satellites is

397
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:35,600
now being used for scientific analysis

398
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,280
and modeling to understand food systems

399
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
we have earth observation satellites

400
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,000
that we can extract weather reports from

401
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,400
and measure pollution

402
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,120
that will help us understand life on

403
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,320
land and below water which is providing

404
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,679
tangible evidence that we need climate

405
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,840
action as soon as possible

406
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,600
another sdg that i have in mind is good

407
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,440
health and well-being

408
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,400
it is

409
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,080
space is vital in achieving that because

410
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,880
we know that many experiments are being

411
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,039
conducted on the international space

412
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,320
station

413
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,000
by astronauts that will help us

414
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
understand the human body and with

415
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,159
advanced medicine

416
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,440
yeah

417
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,080
and are there any space technologies

418
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,520
that

419
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,440
people in the rights con community so a

420
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,840
lot of people in this community are

421
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
of course worried about surveillance and

422
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:30,799
digital rights and privacy and things

423
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,600
like that so are there any technologies

424
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,440
that come in your mind that people in

425
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,720
this community should actually be

426
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
following and paying attention to

427
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,440
uh i definitely uh think that mega

428
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,960
constellations

429
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,120
are interesting and satellite internet

430
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,480
access

431
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,480
with the rise of mega constellations

432
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,039
like spacex's starlink

433
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,840
one web amazon we know that internet

434
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,000
will be provided even to the most

435
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,640
isolated regions on earth

436
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,720
satellite internet is going to be very

437
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,679
fast especially if we're planning to put

438
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:08,640
42 000 in low earth orbit

439
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,960
however there are some issues with this

440
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,039
technology which we know that

441
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:13,840
is

442
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,919
debris

443
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,600
but we are trying to find solutions for

444
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
that but yeah in general i think mega

445
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:21,120
constellations are interesting and i

446
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,880
definitely encourage folks at rightscone

447
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:25,760
to read more about them

448
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,440
yeah could you actually talk a bit more

449
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,520
about i think you just recently

450
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,159
mentioned space debris and that is a

451
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,240
significant issue

452
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,880
um and it's also an example of where

453
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,720
we've taken an issue

454
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,280
such as littering or trash on earth and

455
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,679
unsustainable you know uh use of

456
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
resources and we've sort of already

457
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,600
taken that to space so could you talk a

458
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,440
little bit more about

459
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,960
how we got into such a terrible

460
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,840
situation with space debris and what is

461
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,919
sort of some of the most promising

462
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:00,000
technologies or what are people working

463
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,280
on in order to help solve it

464
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,760
yes so space debris

465
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:08,320
was always there but i guess

466
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,480
in the very beginning of the space race

467
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,360
we

468
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,480
did not even imagine that we'd have

469
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
that huge number of satellites being in

470
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:17,840
orbit

471
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,799
um

472
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
no one cared about that in the beginning

473
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:24,080
and there were no policies to restrict

474
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,280
um such uh behavior where people can

475
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,840
just leave spacecrafts in low earth

476
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,679
orbit and abandon them

477
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,200
um

478
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,520
i think today there there's a huge

479
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,679
number of spacecrafts that are

480
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,320
completely abundant or or shut down but

481
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,880
are still there which causes fist debris

482
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,000
because no one is taking responsibility

483
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:46,960
so

484
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
there

485
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,720
there are some policies that are being

486
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,240
thrown around that maybe every single

487
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,159
country should be responsible for the

488
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,919
debris that they cause then they should

489
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:58,240
come up with like a vacuum solution

490
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
where they can clean up the mass that

491
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,400
they've made in low earth orbit

492
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,520
um we know that today the most

493
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,440
destructive

494
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,679
method of causing

495
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,360
space debris is

496
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,640
an anti-mussels we've had

497
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,400
recently this year i think russia

498
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:19,280
launched an anti-mussel which which was

499
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,640
going to

500
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,880
affect the iss and astronaut had to

501
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,320
evacuate and it was just too dangerous

502
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:27,440
so

503
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,679
the we are still trying to find a

504
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,520
solution for space debris but i don't

505
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,720
think that we

506
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,400
we are close enough to find one

507
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
for now people are are

508
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,159
just focusing on the law and how the on

509
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,720
corpus should enforce some restrictions

510
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,400
on every single country and how every

511
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,000
single country should

512
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,799
just prevent causing more debris other

513
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,200
than cleaning um the mess that they've

514
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,320
already made

515
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,400
right so let's not make the problem

516
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,120
worse than it already is

517
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:00,720
there's a really great question from the

518
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,360
audience about

519
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,720
who should create laws in space and this

520
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,880
is an interesting question because this

521
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:11,760
is a big debate it's been a debate uh

522
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,200
for decades now

523
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,240
um among people who study space law so

524
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,480
from your own opinion like how how can

525
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,000
we make space

526
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,400
more democratic and where should what's

527
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
the venue for making more sort of

528
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,159
international global laws and

529
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,200
regulations around space

530
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,520
yeah so i think space should be treated

531
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,679
like international waters

532
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,679
where um

533
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,679
most countries have a say in what

534
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:40,799
happens and and what what doesn't happen

535
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:43,279
for example in the u.n you know that we

536
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:44,799
have almost

537
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:49,200
150 countries that vote on each law

538
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,120
if it works for them or if it doesn't

539
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,200
from my opinion i think the lawmakers

540
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:57,840
should be the nations since we do

541
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:00,799
meet every single year in the u.n we can

542
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,279
have votes and this is actually how it's

543
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,279
been going for a while so no one owns

544
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:08,640
space but we can regulate it through the

545
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,400
u.n

546
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,440
thankfully we have many space lawyers

547
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,000
the major is starting to

548
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,679
to become more and more popular with

549
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:21,200
them you know the

550
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,240
yeah the education yeah for sure i've

551
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,360
met more

552
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,640
in the last couple of years than i

553
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,120
thought i would um

554
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,679
this is a another great question um and

555
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,159
probably one that's more for us to think

556
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,480
about than to answer because i don't

557
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,400
know if i have the answer um

558
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,279
is a decolonized vision realistic given

559
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,360
that the traditional space varying

560
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,240
powers um and global powers u.s china

561
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:49,760
russia etc are already involved um they

562
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:52,640
won't exactly relinquish their powers is

563
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,760
what this person said um so so what do

564
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:57,840
you what do you think are we

565
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,360
are we being

566
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,320
you know

567
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,039
blindly hopeful here or

568
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:07,520
is is there actually a path forward

569
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,159
i mean yeah that's definitely a

570
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,279
difficult question because um

571
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:14,880
we know that

572
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,600
it is kind of too late

573
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,840
countries are already having their first

574
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,760
steps there and we should have had this

575
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
conversation a long time ago

576
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,000
but

577
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,240
i do believe it is possible there is a

578
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,240
possibility it is very difficult to do

579
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,360
that but if we start now

580
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,520
there is a possibility you know we you

581
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,600
know at least treat the moon since the

582
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,080
moon is then is the target at least

583
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,600
treat the moon as

584
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,279
just like when we treat international

585
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,159
waters where you know vessels uh and

586
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:48,480
national vessels of certain countries or

587
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,120
certain companies are you know

588
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,360
they're just uh

589
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,279
out there and they can operate and do

590
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,120
whatever they want you know

591
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,799
yeah and i i would like to point out

592
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,279
that all hope is not necessarily lost i

593
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,559
think there is a lot of people working

594
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,640
on this question and who are very

595
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,240
dedicated to

596
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,640
trying to create systems and norms that

597
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,679
will prevent us from carrying over a lot

598
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,360
of the colonization that we've seen on

599
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,640
earth to the moon specifically and

600
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,399
i think personally one of the biggest

601
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,279
things we need to do is sort of release

602
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,120
some of these really strict regulations

603
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,279
we have around allowing countries to

604
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,880
work together and hopefully our the

605
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,960
artemis accords is is a step towards

606
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,000
that but also space is a very capital

607
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
capital heavy industry

608
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,679
you need a lot of money for the most

609
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,520
part to be able to do it however we've

610
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,600
been seeing that change over time right

611
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,440
it's getting cheaper it's still pretty

612
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,080
expensive but it is getting cheaper so i

613
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,440
think

614
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,600
bigger countries

615
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,240
investing in smaller countries

616
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
space programs and helping them and

617
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,320
offering to allow them to use their

618
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,120
space ports or their launch vehicles i

619
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,720
think that's the direction we need to go

620
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,960
and i'd love to see to see more of that

621
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,880
and i know there are a lot of people um

622
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,720
who are working on that who want to do

623
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,600
that so for me personally hope is not

624
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
lost yet i think we still have a lot to

625
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,440
hope for and what is it in star wars

626
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,120
they say um

627
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:17,039
hope was it i hope it's all you need or

628
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:19,520
something like that there's

629
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,960
i haven't seen the movie in a while so i

630
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,679
forgot the quote but um but we only have

631
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,240
a couple of minutes left so there's

632
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,399
another question that i think is really

633
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,480
interesting and it goes back to to what

634
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,799
we discussed previously about space

635
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
debris

636
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,600
how do you think countries can be held

637
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,360
accountable for the damage they've

638
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,720
already caused in space so for example

639
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,279
the us how if we have like a specific

640
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:46,559
number of

641
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:49,520
um satellites that orbit are in lower

642
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,080
earth orbit that are no longer working

643
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,000
how can we make sure that okay the u.s

644
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
you need to clean up your mirror

645
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,919
satellites that aren't working anymore

646
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,679
is there a mechanism for that currently

647
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,679
or do we need to create one

648
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:02,640
oh we

649
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:05,120
we definitely need to create one

650
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,399
i know that there are some conversations

651
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,640
that focus on

652
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,399
each country developing their own

653
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,559
technology which would clean space

654
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,320
debris uh again the space vacuum um

655
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,880
technology which is um

656
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:23,520
many many companies are trying to solve

657
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,799
this issue and i also recall that doing

658
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,240
the uncle

659
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,000
some countries were like okay since we

660
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,559
have space debris and the and the issue

661
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,960
is not solved yet uh each country can

662
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,640
pay a fee for

663
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,480
the damage that they've done

664
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,120
i'm not sure if that that's very helpful

665
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,840
because either way we we really do need

666
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:46,399
to develop a technology that would uh

667
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:48,240
help us when it comes to space debris

668
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,919
because you know again mega

669
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,320
constellations are are about to happen

670
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,120
and we're gonna have starlink is aiming

671
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,320
to have

672
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,919
42 000 uh satellites in low earth orbit

673
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:02,720
so how can we save

674
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:06,320
save low earth orbit from that you know

675
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:07,679
and what

676
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,520
role do you think

677
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,919
these companies themselves should be

678
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,360
playing in

679
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:14,880
you know we've been talking a lot about

680
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,640
the countries um

681
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,320
but you know there's a lot of private

682
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,320
actors in this space now more than ever

683
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,720
before and they're they're given more

684
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,679
um their ability to go into space

685
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,159
more now is beyond what we could have

686
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
imagined uh just a couple of years ago

687
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,880
and you mentioned uh spacex

688
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:35,120
so how much responsibility do you think

689
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,000
should actually fall on the companies to

690
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,080
also step up and

691
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,000
make sure that they're not making the

692
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,120
situation worse

693
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,960
they definitely should be treated just

694
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,840
like

695
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,880
the countries because you know uh spacex

696
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,440
now is as big as a country if you if

697
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,919
we're looking at space activity they

698
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,080
have many launches they've contributed

699
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:01,600
to the space sector like in a very

700
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,240
big and vital way so if countries are

701
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,640
being held responsible i'm pretty sure

702
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,720
that companies should be held

703
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,960
responsible as well

704
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
yeah almost like with mining practices

705
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,480
on earth or anything like that there

706
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,039
should be some regulation regulatory

707
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,200
practices there and and

708
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,200
sort of reviews done by governments so i

709
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
would agree too

710
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:24,399
as an engineer i think you might

711
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,360
appreciate this next question um how can

712
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,440
we ensure the future of space is open

713
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:32,159
source

714
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,640
can we

715
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:38,000
i think uh you know space agencies

716
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,159
should uh share the all the data that

717
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:41,519
they have

718
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:43,760
and make it open source

719
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,039
um we

720
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,039
that would be very helpful because you

721
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,760
know

722
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,360
we know that there are many satellites

723
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,440
out there we could really use the data

724
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,320
that they have and they're mainly like

725
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,200
uh

726
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:57,120
they're mainly operated by

727
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,600
big space agencies and big governments

728
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:01,200
so we do need

729
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,840
we do need it to be open source um

730
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,679
i believe that many many people are

731
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:07,039
trying to do that

732
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:09,600
um especially in the iac like next year

733
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,760
we are going to talk about how can we

734
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,919
make space open source and just

735
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:16,720
available for everyone how can we make

736
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,440
data unlimited you know

737
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,000
yeah and i think nasa

738
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,640
does an okay job at some of that they do

739
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,519
publish a lot of the data behind their

740
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:29,279
research um

741
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:31,279
on their website or through

742
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:33,679
nasa's huge so multiple websites but

743
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:34,960
yeah i agree with you i think there

744
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,640
definitely needs to be more information

745
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,919
sharing and

746
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,000
you know citizen scientists are where

747
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,440
we've come up with some of some of the

748
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,080
best solutions to some of the the

749
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:45,519
greatest issues right so the more

750
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,679
information they have the more solutions

751
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:49,600
they can create so i completely agree

752
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:50,720
with that

753
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,960
we only have about a minute and a half

754
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:54,880
left and there's a question that i just

755
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:57,760
have to get to because it is a huge

756
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,399
debate within the space nerd community

757
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,120
um which is better star trek or star

758
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,600
wars

759
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:08,559
it has to be a star wars it's a no

760
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:11,559
brainer

761
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,880
yeah i cannot wait to watch the uh

762
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:18,159
obi-wan kenobi yes yeah yeah i've been

763
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,159
waiting for that um

764
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:22,159
well lama it's been such a pleasure

765
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:25,120
speaking with you and is there any last

766
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:26,559
parting thought you would like to leave

767
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,399
the rights community rightscon community

768
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,000
with

769
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,360
um yeah i i would love for people to

770
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,200
read more about space and how it

771
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,799
contributes to the sdgs since they

772
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:40,320
their vital when it comes to human

773
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,960
rights we know that space

774
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,200
is mostly seen as this far-fetched

775
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,760
very technical field but

776
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,399
it is participating heavily in human

777
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:54,399
rights and it is saving our environment

778
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,519
so countries investing in space is

779
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,919
uh something important and yeah i

780
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,440
believe people should read more about

781
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,760
space and how it's helping us on earth

782
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,760
and how it's um

783
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,399
helping humans gain their rights

784
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,119
yes and i will just once again mention

785
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,599
this incredible ted talk by dr danielle

786
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:16,239
wood where she she talks just about that

787
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,320
so so thank you so much lama it's been

788
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,399
such a pleasure

789
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,399
thank you victoria thank you that was

790
