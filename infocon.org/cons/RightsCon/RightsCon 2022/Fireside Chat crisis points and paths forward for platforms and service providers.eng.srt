the wikimedia foundation where we work

towards a world in which every single

00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,240
human being can freely share in the sum

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,679
of all knowledge

13
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:33,280
i'm excited to be joined today by a

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,120
distinguished group of panelists

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,120
representing both civil society and the

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,520
private sector

17
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,760
the topics of authoritarian transitions

18
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,520
military takeovers and political

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,920
instability are unfortunately

20
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,920
on all of our minds as we watch the

21
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,399
military invasion of ukraine and horror

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:52,399
friday marked the 100th day since the

23
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,719
russian invasion of ukraine began

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,160
since then the world has seen an

25
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,079
unprecedented mobilization of the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,079
private sector and joining a global

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:02,000
sanctions regime in response to the

28
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,359
aggression

29
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,959
countless international companies have

30
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,880
withdrawn from russia or stopped doing

31
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,720
business with russian entities

32
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,560
underscoring a global rejection of

33
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,799
russia's military invasion and a growing

34
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,720
responsibility among businesses to

35
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,520
respond ethically to such events

36
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:20,159
similarly civil society and humanitarian

37
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,640
aid organizations mobilize quickly to

38
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,040
document human rights abuses advocate

39
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,040
for the rights of victims and to provide

40
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,960
basic necessities to help civilians

41
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,439
displaced by the invasion

42
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,600
yet these challenges are not unique to

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
the armed conflict in ukraine

44
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
in myanmar the military junta has

45
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,520
crushed civil society and political

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,400
dissent

47
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
through a brutal crackdown that has

48
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,920
gutted freedom freedom of expression

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,320
association and privacy among other

50
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:48,000
human rights

51
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,600
this has occurred both online and

52
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,880
offline beginning in early 2021.

53
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,119
in ethiopia the tigray region is

54
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,880
experiencing the world's second longest

55
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,399
internet shutdown

56
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,880
for more than 580 days the public there

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,399
has been in the dark as authorities

58
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,759
censor and control the flow of

59
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,000
information amid an ongoing armed

60
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,920
conflict making it difficult for

61
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,598
journalists and human rights groups to

62
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
document and raise awareness about human

63
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,480
rights violations against civilians

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,080
our panel today will discuss how the

65
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,080
private sector and civil society can

66
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
strengthen their partnerships in

67
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,400
response to these challenges now and in

68
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,480
the future

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,920
before i introduce our distinguished

70
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,599
panelists i'd like to invite our

71
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:29,280
audience to please share their questions

72
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,640
in the chat as we move through this

73
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,560
conversation

74
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,160
without further ado i'd like to

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,280
introduce anastasia zermans campaigner

76
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:39,360
for eastern europe and central asia for

77
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,879
access now

78
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:43,360
as well as kristen flynn goodwin general

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,360
manager of the digital security unit at

80
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,879
microsoft

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,800
and mike cole president at saifon

82
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,800
anastasia i'll pose the first question

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,959
to you to set the stage

84
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,480
what are the challenges that civil

85
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
society has been facing in staying

86
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,319
connected and safe on platforms

87
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,239
especially during times of authoritarian

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,800
transitions in political instability

89
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,560
specifically when when talking about

90
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,159
this situation

91
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,640
russia ukraine and even belarus come to

92
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,680
mind as recent examples

93
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,040
yeah sure

94
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,000
and actually answering your question let

95
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,200
me bring the example of belarus because

96
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,480
while

97
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,879
international communities attention has

98
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,840
shifted towards ukraine and russia the

99
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,560
crackdown on civil society in belarus is

100
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,159
hoping is happening both offline and

101
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,360
online

102
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,360
as of today to

103
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,680
1221 persons are recognized in belarus

104
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,680
as political prisoners

105
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,360
and since 2020 this presidential

106
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,319
election

107
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,879
750 ngos have been liquidated either by

108
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,280
the government or following the pressure

109
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,200
of the government

110
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,239
their websites are blocked same as

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,000
websites of almost all independent media

112
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,040
outlets and values and in general

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,080
expressing critical views and opinions

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,360
on the governmental policies or actions

115
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,959
same as actions of governmental

116
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:17,440
officials online can lead to

117
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,320
disproportionate punishments one of the

118
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,960
most striking example at least for me

119
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
was when in belarus one woman was

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,720
sentenced to two years of

121
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,400
limitation of freedom

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,199
for posting as was defined by court and

123
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,960
insulting command in a form of emoji so

124
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,360
just an emoji and you're sentenced to

125
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,440
two years in prison

126
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,000
of course the situation creates a risk

127
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,840
of self-censorship

128
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,280
and

129
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
many independent media outlets in

130
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
belarus decided to disable their

131
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
commentary sections on their website

132
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,560
because as they told

133
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,880
the audience it is impossible today to

134
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:03,199
define what can be considered as

135
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,320
extremism online

136
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,440
speaking of are the risks

137
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,639
that users face while stay

138
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
staying online

139
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,039
i should say that along with general

140
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,680
cyber threats and privacy concerns there

141
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,199
are other risks that very specific to

142
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:25,840
authoritarian regimes and not only to

143
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,680
valaries

144
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,600
like i mentioned before vague

145
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,759
anti-extremism

146
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,360
regulations and laws bans not only civil

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,360
society and independent media but

148
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,960
they actually subject users to very

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,960
disproportionate

150
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,060
sanctions and disproportionate

151
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,840
[Music]

152
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,520
disproportionate punishments

153
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,240
uh while we like

154
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,199
even sharing likes commenting can lead

155
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,240
to a criminal offense and why we need to

156
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,520
keep such a close eye on this situation

157
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,639
is because

158
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
the crisis can escalate pretty quickly

159
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,400
let's just look on russia we considered

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,199
that station in russia is pretty

161
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:19,840
concerning before february but right now

162
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
when mata is recognized as extremism

163
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,319
organization in russia when facebook and

164
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,360
instagram are banned when twitter is

165
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
blocked and tick-tock decided to cease

166
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
live streaming and other functions

167
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,440
because of the fear of persecution

168
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
when most of the

169
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,199
vpns are still available but

170
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,680
each day is a list of bent ones is

171
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,759
growing

172
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,960
this is

173
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
this is a clear example how we uh down

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,000
sliding from bad to worse

175
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,880
thank you for your thoughts um

176
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,479
from your point of view what are some

177
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,639
gaps that platforms can fill to keep

178
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,800
civil society connected and safe on

179
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,400
their platforms

180
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,560
um in the face of all of these different

181
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,240
threats where governments are using

182
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
technical means as well as

183
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,880
legal means like you mentioned terrorism

184
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
laws to to stifle dissent

185
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,280
well first of all let's agree on this

186
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,319
let's keep civil society connected and

187
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,199
do not disconnect russian and belarusian

188
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,400
users so keep you services available to

189
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
them as you may know access now and

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,160
coalition of civil society organization

191
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:41,120
weren't allied to governments against

192
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,759
counterproductive sanctions that would

193
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,639
further isolate russian users and to

194
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,039
recent users from the free flow of

195
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,319
information

196
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,560
and we are pleased to see that last

197
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,960
month for example uk government

198
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,440
responded to this warning

199
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,000
uh by taking action to ensure that

200
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
people in russia and in belarus we hope

201
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,160
retain access to the global internet and

202
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,039
that social social media and news media

203
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
services can still operate inside the

204
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,280
countries

205
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,360
the similar approach was actually taken

206
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,639
by by an administration

207
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,160
who recently issued general license 25

208
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,479
excluding services

209
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,639
software hardware and technologies that

210
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,800
enable exchange of communication online

211
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,719
from the sanction lists

212
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,958
but sometimes companies

213
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,519
are acting on their own following the

214
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,000
external pressure i guess and many cloud

215
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
services crms even slack became

216
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,560
unavailable to russian users

217
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,480
even tech donation programs through

218
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,519
techsoup for example have been suspended

219
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,080
you may end uh you must understand that

220
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,600
while visa mastercard and

221
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:03,040
paypal have left russia it is almost

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,600
impossible for ngos and

223
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,760
independent media outlets to receive

224
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:10,640
donations to continue their work and to

225
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,680
use v-bands as well

226
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,880
so uh this is the first thing and the

227
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,760
second thing is perhaps to

228
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,839
boost the security of users online

229
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,000
such initiatives like

230
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,560
log profile initiative but meta for

231
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,839
example when you can hide your followers

232
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,560
and the list of friends is extremely

233
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,680
helpful

234
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,000
the disappearing messaging feature on

235
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,480
the whatsapp recently introduced is a

236
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,200
good practice too

237
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,480
perhaps

238
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,440
platforms can also

239
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,360
give a hand to spell society with

240
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,440
fighting disinformation and propaganda

241
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,519
by clearly marking state-owned and

242
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,600
control accounts for example so users

243
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,360
can clearly distinguish between

244
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,600
independent and not so independent

245
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,760
information online but since the same

246
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,000
time yes of course we need to secure

247
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,399
accounts of independent journalists not

248
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,120
to ban them and

249
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,519
not to remove content

250
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,480
produced by them

251
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,720
kristin i i'd like to turn it over to

252
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,839
you

253
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,000
how is microsoft managing its policies

254
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,399
and businesses in in repressive context

255
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,079
like we're talking about how does it

256
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,760
ensure that civil society is able to

257
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:30,160
stay connected to its services and that

258
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,640
users at risk can stay safe on its

259
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,120
platforms

260
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,279
thank you for that question so

261
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,440
one of the things that i do at microsoft

262
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,079
is my team and i specialize in studying

263
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
nation state attack activity so we

264
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,800
specifically spent a lot of time looking

265
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,560
at how russia china iran and north korea

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,399
attack their victims who are their

267
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,160
victims what are they going after and

268
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,120
why

269
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,680
and what we learn from a lot of that is

270
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,839
that

271
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,160
so much of what governments are going

272
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,240
after setting aside the war in ukraine

273
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,000
which from a

274
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,360
is is

275
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,880
a horrific thing from a human rights

276
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
perspective and an anomaly from a data

277
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,600
perspective

278
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,560
almost

279
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,720
90 percent of attacks that we see are

280
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,720
not against traditional critical

281
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,000
infrastructures

282
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,240
nation states are largely engaging in

283
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,800
intelligence collection operations they

284
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,640
seek information

285
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:29,839
and

286
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
typically they collect it from

287
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,839
uh think tanks

288
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,959
ngos igos and the media

289
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,920
and

290
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,440
one of the things that's interesting is

291
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,680
that civil society is right in that

292
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,560
space

293
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,959
right at times it functions like media

294
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:46,800
sharing information at at times it's a

295
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,959
think tank you know even working with

296
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:50,639
the government or other partners to

297
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,800
explore new policies or developments and

298
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,880
definitely functioning like an ngo or an

299
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,040
igo and so

300
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,639
it's important to think about the fact

301
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,600
that

302
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,040
as a community

303
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,000
you are

304
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
absolutely in the crosshairs of major

305
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,320
nation states that seek to know

306
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,240
information that you have and how you're

307
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,240
going to use it

308
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,079
we also see the

309
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,600
these targeting

310
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,519
activities coming from

311
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,160
cyber mercenaries companies like nso

312
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,120
group last year we did a disruption

313
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,880
against a

314
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,600
a private sector actor that we called

315
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,760
sargon citizen lab calls kandaru and

316
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,399
we saw them going after

317
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,200
human rights advocates journalists

318
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,160
politicians and others in spain and in

319
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,079
other countries around europe and when

320
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,240
we saw that that those attacks were

321
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,000
happening we saw that our infrastructure

322
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,600
was being used as a part of those

323
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,560
attacks

324
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,440
uh

325
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,880
we did one of the most fun things you

326
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,399
can do as an attorney at microsoft we

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,880
blew it up you know we uh we found the

328
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,480
infrastructure the accounts the malware

329
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,720
that were being used and and

330
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,360
we we eradicated it

331
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
and

332
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
that's that is a

333
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,240
fantastic feeling when you know that you

334
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,000
can have an immediate effect on an

335
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
attack or a campaign like that

336
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,800
on the private sector offensive actor

337
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
and the mercenary side

338
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
much of the intelligence collection

339
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,680
focuses on phones devices uh tracking

340
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,320
locations and and collect information a

341
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,440
lot nso group and so

342
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,880
those are our

343
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,200
as uh as windows phone did not rocket

344
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,480
around the world in ways that we had

345
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:32,079
hoped our ability to to uh impact issues

346
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,399
at the device level is harder

347
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:35,760
but we partner

348
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,279
with groups that are tracking those

349
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,360
activities and when there are indicators

350
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,600
of compromise that we can go and do

351
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,800
something about

352
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,120
we absolutely do that

353
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,519
not only is it the right thing to do

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,959
because of the cloud and cloud

355
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:51,199
technologies it enables us to be able to

356
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,600
then push those protections out at scale

357
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,240
because if a nation state or a cyber

358
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,240
mercenary is using those tactics against

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,000
civil society

360
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,639
they work against other groups and so

361
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,680
our interest as fast as possible is to

362
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,760
get them into the cloud and then deploy

363
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,680
them globally

364
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,399
that's a really important distinction um

365
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,680
if you are

366
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,680
on premises if you've got your own

367
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
infrastructure and you're running your

368
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,680
own back-end servers and your your own

369
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,440
um capabilities

370
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,639
generally you that's going to be

371
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,160
hand-to-hand combat against a

372
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,639
nation-state actor um you know the

373
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,920
beauty of of being here at microsoft and

374
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,360
partnering with the microsoft threat

375
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,720
intelligence center is that we've got

376
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,560
teams that do nothing but

377
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,120
track nation state attackers when

378
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,120
there's a nation-state actor

379
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
that that we tracked that is targeted or

380
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,959
identified or compromised a customer of

381
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,519
ours either on the consumer side or on

382
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,800
the enterprise side then we're going to

383
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,160
notify them

384
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,720
and you know that gives us the ability

385
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,079
to

386
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,000
make sure that we're making people aware

387
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,920
as fast as possible with the attack

388
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,959
activity

389
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,920
and through programs like a account

390
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,160
guard we can work with human rights

391
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,399
organizations and inside civil society

392
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,959
so that personal accounts

393
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,199
we can't protect gmail accounts or third

394
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,360
parties but you know hotmail or or

395
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,120
outlook.com addresses you know we can

396
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
help partner with uh the victim and with

397
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,519
the organization to help share more

398
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,760
context about what happened and prevent

399
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,440
the the effects of those attacks from

400
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,279
hitting others

401
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,399
this is a

402
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:29,600
really really important area because uh

403
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,440
nation states are so aggressive in the

404
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,920
intelligence collection operation space

405
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,160
they don't care what platform you're on

406
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,680
they don't care what technology you're

407
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,759
using because they've been tasked by

408
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:41,440
their government to go collect

409
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,720
information

410
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
and they're going to go find a way to

411
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,920
fulfill that mission

412
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,880
and so that that context is really what

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,199
drives us to work hard to think about

414
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:52,959
how do we come up with protections at

415
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,120
scale and get them out as fast as

416
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,440
possible

417
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,759
kristen you bring up a really good point

418
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
that i think is important to really hit

419
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,600
home that nation states are collecting

420
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,320
information and intelligence on civil

421
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,759
society organizations on journalists and

422
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:14,079
indeed on everyday citizens um

423
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,239
so

424
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,800
these actors civil society

425
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,120
journalists citizens they're looking for

426
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,199
more and more tools that they can use to

427
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:25,279
protect themselves from these sorts of

428
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:26,880
threats and so i actually want to to

429
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
bring in mike to this uh question given

430
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,440
the unprecedented growth that sciphon

431
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,680
used in russia to for for actors to

432
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,600
protect themselves and the attempts to

433
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,680
block it by the russian government

434
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,440
what is your company doing in response

435
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
to ensure that russians continue to stay

436
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,360
online and are able to access

437
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
information

438
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,519
in their context

439
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,040
sorry is that for mike

440
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,880
for mike yes please

441
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,000
ah there we go okay hi uh yes um uh

442
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:00,880
now

443
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,120
so russia is obviously front and center

444
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,640
here um we could go back to august of

445
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,520
2020 when belarus the the

446
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,039
lupochenko

447
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,959
elections were contested

448
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,559
we

449
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,119
saw a surge in use there as well

450
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,119
you know siphon is basically the canary

451
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,679
in the coal mine to tell you how rogue

452
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,599
government is going on their population

453
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,919
because uh depending on how

454
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,839
extreme the filtering is that they put

455
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,640
in

456
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,880
we get more people on our network

457
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,400
in the case of russia you know before

458
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
the election we were sitting at around

459
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,280
40 000 daily active users on our network

460
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,039
and within uh

461
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,400
uh within

462
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
a week of the invasion we were up to 1.1

463
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,720
million uh russians a day um our

464
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
software's translated into

465
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,880
40 languages so it's easy for people to

466
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,960
you know take a word-of-mouth kind of uh

467
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,280
you know ability to go get the software

468
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,840
um so uh

469
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,520
you know

470
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
but that said we've we sharpened our uh

471
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,320
you know we got our chops up uh in iran

472
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,200
and in china over the last uh 14 years

473
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,160
since siphon's been around um and we've

474
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,240
you know moved along with the uh with

475
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
the way the internet has changed which

476
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:14,960
is uh you know people are coming in with

477
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,039
mobile devices and all the rest of that

478
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,559
um essentially uh what we do is we make

479
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,880
sure that um uh our protocols are

480
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,360
capable of evading uh

481
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,240
standard filtering systems and then and

482
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,840
also when they do invade them then it's

483
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:32,400
a secure tunnel that is um uh

484
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:34,320
wrapped in a tunnel so they can't even

485
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,200
um see anything uh you know in terms of

486
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,039
uh anything that's going over the line

487
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,120
um so there's two there's two aspects to

488
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,880
protecting the person one is to get them

489
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,120
to actually connect uh which is to

490
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,679
provide you know article 19 fundamental

491
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,880
human right to everybody which is

492
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,400
electronic information regardless of

493
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,440
where they are in the world um and uh

494
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
so you know we've been doing this for

495
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,000
many years we do it on windows and mac

496
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,880
and ios and android

497
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,840
so

498
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,200
we didn't really do anything different

499
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,600
when the russian people came to the

500
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,120
plate except make sure that we had

501
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,600
servers that would work well for that

502
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,160
region of the world um we we took the

503
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:15,120
surge uh on and uh as i said you know

504
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,760
within a week we were 1.1 million the um

505
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:21,039
there was a a play by the um uh

506
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,440
internet service providers in russia

507
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,600
which was also actually telegraphed a

508
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,480
year earlier when uh rose telecom was

509
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:31,280
ordered to start to to implement uh deep

510
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,440
packet inspection routers at all their

511
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:37,760
uh spots uh as well as other isps um

512
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,520
but you know this um

513
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,440
this turning on the switch in russia is

514
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,559
a little bit different you've got a

515
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,400
world you know world-class internet

516
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,320
there you've got people doing commerce

517
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,280
as we've we've heard about um usually in

518
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:50,880
in scifon's world like we're helping

519
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,960
mymar we're helping iran we're helping

520
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:56,000
even china which is sort of in and out

521
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,600
of the economic

522
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,600
situation depending on how it is but

523
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,120
mostly it's sort of already

524
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,679
disenfranchised people so this was quite

525
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,080
a shock for the world to see this happen

526
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,400
to uh you know

527
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,720
regularly commercially viable things

528
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
suddenly went away in a day and it

529
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:15,039
caught everybody's attention uh

530
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:18,480
now we did see uh in the middle of march

531
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,039
a major attack on vpn protocols in

532
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,600
general uh which brought down everybody

533
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,280
um and we've been chipping away we're

534
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:27,919
now actually 1.3 million today so uh

535
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:29,760
yesterday we had 1.3 million russians on

536
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,000
our network so um we're able to uh you

537
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,600
know our system is designed to um uh

538
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,440
sort of auto automatically make

539
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,799
adjustments to

540
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,919
new uh

541
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,600
attack vectors and that kind of thing

542
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,440
and that makes it sound very easy but

543
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,520
it's it's extremely uh you know

544
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,360
interesting uh you know from a computer

545
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,360
science point of view adversarial

546
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:52,559
environment

547
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,360
to be able to get people to connect um

548
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,880
you know right now we're seeing a new

549
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,520
surge in russia as they're uh as they're

550
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,679
gearing up their dpi boxes their dpi

551
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,840
boxes are picking up more and more vpns

552
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
and knocking them off as they go along

553
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,120
and of course people are moving over to

554
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
siphon uh as that happens

555
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,720
um

556
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,880
so you know basically

557
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,400
we just do what we do

558
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:15,440
this

559
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,080
this this is you know i could go cuba uh

560
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,280
belarus um the latest surges uh sudan

561
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,039
had a big one nobody really picked up on

562
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,039
that one but there was a giant uh surge

563
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,880
there lots of stuff going on um

564
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,280
what we do is just make sure that we

565
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,280
have the capacity to take on these

566
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
surges

567
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
and design software that's able to

568
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,200
provide it on demand um you know in the

569
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,880
case of belarus it was you know

570
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,400
basically a

571
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,480
four week uh time period where the bella

572
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,919
russians really needed us and then after

573
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:47,760
that there was a capitulation there's

574
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
typically capitulation against site one

575
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,320
because

576
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,440
uh unlike the other vpn protocols um uh

577
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,960
if you break siphon you kind of break

578
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,280
your own internet in the process so a

579
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,960
lot of lot of um there's a very

580
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,400
interesting interplay there you know

581
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,039
people uh constantly connecting

582
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:04,799
we learn about what connections work and

583
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:07,440
don't work um and then uh

584
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
at some point when uh you know somebody

585
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,760
some tech guy calls up and says hey you

586
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,440
know you want me to tell that into this

587
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,000
uh machine so i can get it going i can't

588
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,200
because you guys have blocked all the

589
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,280
feet all the ports

590
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,280
and this turns out so

591
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:23,919
there's um there's only so much

592
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,760
authoritarian

593
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,640
approach can take to this uh ultimately

594
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,840
it's a battle of the people against uh

595
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,440
against

596
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,080
a

597
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,480
small number of people um we typically

598
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,600
find

599
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,799
that

600
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,400
when social media

601
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,320
platforms in particular and most

602
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:44,080
importantly when communication platforms

603
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,919
get blocked that's when you see people

604
00:22:45,919 --> 00:22:47,440
pouring into siphon because they just

605
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,320
can't not have it um

606
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
you know the russia one i'm at one we're

607
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,799
at 1.3 million today but in back at the

608
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,919
end of 2018 we had 10.5 million people

609
00:22:57,919 --> 00:22:59,760
in iran on our network when the iranian

610
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,760
government decided to block telegram in

611
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,039
one day

612
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:06,559
so uh this is um

613
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,600
i guess the governments are going to

614
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,559
learn over time that uh

615
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,640
you know it's going to kind of work for

616
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,400
i guess it for them it's a trade-off

617
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,120
right uh is is it worth

618
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,360
breaking their own internet or is it not

619
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,159
um

620
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,559
so i think over time uh

621
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,960
we're going to see uh

622
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,240
constantly

623
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,679
governments making these decisions when

624
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,840
they're sort of flailing uh

625
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,919
but um you know as long as people keep

626
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:33,919
connecting i think the message will

627
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:35,840
be pretty clear to them that their they

628
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,720
should stop doing that

629
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
thanks mike um kristen i i'd like to

630
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,640
bring it back to microsoft and how

631
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:46,720
microsoft responds when there are

632
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,880
restrictions or limitations or blockages

633
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,760
of of different services

634
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,960
in these sorts of contexts

635
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:58,320
so

636
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,400
our primary focus is in making sure that

637
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
our products and services

638
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,200
maintain accessibility for for all and

639
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
for all of our users around the world

640
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
so when we see an issue that is

641
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,880
impacting our platform um then then

642
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,640
microsoft's security and incident

643
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,520
response teams get engaged to look at it

644
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,960
whether the the issue is something

645
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
that's impacting us on our network side

646
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
that we can control

647
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:25,840
or if it's uh external to us

648
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:28,320
then can we share that information about

649
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,600
the external attack activity with

650
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,880
uh

651
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,960
cisa in the united states for example

652
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:35,919
you know the department of homeland

653
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,159
security or others who can help

654
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,880
engage in response uh that that

655
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,720
collective response and the community

656
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,960
response is a really important part to

657
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,039
that broader information sharing and an

658
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,400
ability to

659
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,559
to spot issues so

660
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:53,679
um as far as as how we we play in the

661
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,400
community space obviously microsoft

662
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,440
will

663
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,960
publish a lot of information about

664
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
attacks and activity that we see either

665
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,480
through the microsoft security response

666
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,400
center blog or other security

667
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,400
intelligence channels

668
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,240
or of course the fastest way to find out

669
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,600
about what's going on from an attack

670
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,080
perspective twitter and so

671
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,960
we're we're hyper connected at all times

672
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,200
when we when we see attack activity that

673
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
we can go do something about it

674
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:25,039
great thank you and and

675
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:27,120
how does microsoft work to involve civil

676
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,200
society organizations when these threats

677
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,720
emerge perhaps when they are

678
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,880
specifically targeted um is there an

679
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:34,640
existing relationship are there existing

680
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,039
channels that civil society and

681
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:39,440
companies like microsoft can can use to

682
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,480
to engage um in these situations

683
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,000
sure so uh whenever we we see nation

684
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,919
state or advanced attack activity

685
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,640
against a civil society customer of ours

686
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,960
then we will notify them if you're an

687
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,440
enterprise customer um

688
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,279
then a part of every microsoft contract

689
00:25:57,279 --> 00:25:58,799
there's a point of contact for who we

690
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:01,039
will reach out to we we

691
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,200
we will call that person or find a way

692
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,919
to to get in touch with them and we're

693
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:08,240
strongly convicted in the belief that

694
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,480
when we do a notification like that we

695
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:11,760
have to provide

696
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:13,919
actionable information so that you can

697
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,600
go and look for the data of what

698
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,120
happened in the evidence to the attack

699
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,720
in your own systems

700
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,440
over the past um

701
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
i guess since about august of 2018 when

702
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
we started doing these notifications

703
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,480
we've done over 60 000 of them to

704
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,039
victims all around the world and that

705
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,200
number is only going to continue to go

706
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,440
up over time right so

707
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,400
from a civil society perspective

708
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
if you're in the cloud and you have a a

709
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:44,080
cloud service of ours then being really

710
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,720
clear who who you told us is your point

711
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,480
of contact will be really important

712
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,480
because when it matters that's who we

713
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,960
will call and so having a a primary

714
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,919
email address a backup email address a

715
00:26:57,919 --> 00:26:59,679
primary phone number a secondary phone

716
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,360
number those are all things that we will

717
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,720
leverage we know that on the individual

718
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,480
account side in particular

719
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,039
nation states like to compromise email

720
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:10,159
accounts

721
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:12,799
and then enable mail forwarding

722
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,279
and so if you uh if you

723
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,279
deep dive deep into your settings and

724
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:18,960
you check mail forwarding

725
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,399
on your personal accounts if you see

726
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,480
that that's that's checked that's often

727
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:24,000
a sign that you've been compromised by a

728
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
nation state actor right so

729
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,799
um in those cases we will

730
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,279
force an automatic password reset and

731
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,720
and we'll we'll

732
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,039
provide notification to the customer but

733
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,679
you have to be careful that you are not

734
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:39,840
allowing your account emails to be

735
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,960
forwarded to a third party so just from

736
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,720
a personal hygiene perspective that's

737
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,480
something i always recommend people in

738
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,279
the civil society space just you know

739
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,200
set a monthly calendar reminder to think

740
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
about your own personal hygiene

741
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,360
check the settings on your phone check

742
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,840
the settings on your your email accounts

743
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
make sure that that

744
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,799
nobody has changed any settings and even

745
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,240
take a picture of your settings you

746
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,799
remind yourself of what your baseline is

747
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:09,279
to help you identify when something has

748
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:11,600
been manipulated

749
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,320
great so keeping lines of communication

750
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,799
clearly identified and open

751
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,799
and always going in to check your

752
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:20,399
security settings and checking them

753
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:22,080
regularly that's what i'm hearing

754
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,520
correct

755
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,919
uh mike i would like to pose the same

756
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,760
question to you how does psiphon engage

757
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,720
civil society and what do you recommend

758
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,960
for civil society to do to protect

759
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,039
itself in in the face of these threats

760
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,279
um well on the civil civil society point

761
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,080
of view we are active in the internet

762
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
freedom community that comes out of the

763
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:49,840
uh usg funding um which is uh by the way

764
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:51,200
super important and the rest of the

765
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,520
world should really uh wake up and start

766
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
to participate in this and stop leaving

767
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:57,440
it just to the us congress to providing

768
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,840
the internet freedom funds

769
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,919
but at least uh out of that little pitch

770
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,000
there is um there there's a there's a

771
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,840
vibrant community uh

772
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,720
people are constantly in contact and um

773
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,159
you know for example we have uh provided

774
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,600
we have a version of the software which

775
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,120
allows anybody to

776
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,000
run

777
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,240
their particular site uh on unblocked

778
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,840
and that kind of thing

779
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,159
but um i think on the civil society

780
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
point of view i i have to say we are

781
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,039
part of it uh but we are really about a

782
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,679
scale uh solution to the problems that

783
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:32,000
that are here we're not here to

784
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,640
necessarily i mean we

785
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,080
you know by definition we solve all the

786
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,600
individual problems but each individual

787
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,559
problem is of their own like and so um

788
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,960
you know for example uh you know

789
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,120
it's free to download siphon um

790
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,200
everybody get on it uh if they're part

791
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,799
of the if they're have a contact

792
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,960
anywhere obviously uh oh and by the way

793
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,039
we're running um siphon as fast as

794
00:29:53,039 --> 00:29:54,799
possible inside of russia and inside of

795
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,440
ukraine and uh right now uh as part of

796
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,000
our uh you know uh thing so there's no

797
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,760
need for people to you know purchase

798
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,320
anything or to get faster service or any

799
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,320
of that other stuff that was typical uh

800
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
for parts of the world where people can

801
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,159
pay so that that's one of the things we

802
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
do all the time um and uh open up that

803
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,200
stuff and again that's come through some

804
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,760
uh supporting uh support through the usg

805
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
funding uh on this stuff and you know

806
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,880
they're they're uh uh very proactive to

807
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,039
make sure that these things are are met

808
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,039
and that the needs are are met so that

809
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:29,039
we can meet the scale problem um i think

810
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,559
there's a limit that's why i was calling

811
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,600
out the rest of the countries in the

812
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,679
world to you know step into this because

813
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:35,679
it's not really fair to uh

814
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,600
it's g8 right

815
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,200
i don't know why the g1 has to do all

816
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,279
the work of the g8 on this internet

817
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,520
freedom issue um but you know the bottom

818
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,200
line is there'd be nobody in russia

819
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,640
connected to the internet right now if

820
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,919
it wasn't for the internet freedom

821
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:49,679
program because none of the commercial

822
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,279
vpns are working anymore because none of

823
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:53,520
them are designed to work in in hostile

824
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,120
environments they're designed to get you

825
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,120
on us netflix

826
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,279
this is this is a fundamental difference

827
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:01,360
in approach that siphon has been

828
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:03,519
afforded as a result of the four

829
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,960
thinking of the internet freedom

830
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,480
programs that are going on at which

831
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,039
access now has part you know uh been

832
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,960
active in and the rights con comes out

833
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,120
of uh so you know well done everybody in

834
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,840
that sense uh here we are uh

835
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,559
able to uh parry the you know actually

836
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:21,200
provide uh viable service to people at a

837
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,200
critical time uh this is why you do it

838
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,320
and uh here it is working so um uh in

839
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:29,039
that sense we're getting there um uh the

840
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,360
real problem of course is uh education

841
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,640
beyond people who are um who are uh you

842
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,320
know acutely aware of how to get around

843
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,679
these things and beyond the word of

844
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:40,320
mouth um you know i can't necessarily

845
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,840
imagine uh

846
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,440
explaining to my mother how to get uh on

847
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:45,919
the internet if toronto suddenly was uh

848
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,039
you know uh

849
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:47,840
was

850
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:50,480
filtered so these are some of the new

851
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,799
bridges that need to be uh crossed in

852
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,480
terms of uh getting into the population

853
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,320
scale stuff but you know that said i

854
00:31:56,320 --> 00:31:58,399
mean the one in cuba was mine mind

855
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,360
boggling

856
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,200
1.2 million people in cuba on our

857
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,640
network i didn't even know there was 1.2

858
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,240
million people in cuba that wanted to

859
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,640
get on the network so that was uh you

860
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:07,919
know i think we were probably at around

861
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
67 of the entire population was using

862
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,360
our software so uh i think you know that

863
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,080
that's um that's where

864
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,279

the chat

909
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
um right now we've got a question from

910
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,600
justin and i'll go ahead and read that

911
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:08,879
off for our panelists here and

912
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:10,800
you all can can answer

913
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,719
from your perspective

914
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,199
justin asks what legal measures can be

915
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,839
taken against national multinational and

916
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,000
state-sponsored corporations when they

917
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,399
intentionally enable authoritarian

918
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,960
transitions military takeovers and

919
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,719
political instability

920
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:29,040
we have become dependent upon our tools

921
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,520
and access can be critical but to what

922
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:33,760
degree is the very corporate structure

923
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:34,879
and legally

924
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,239
mandated bottom line culpable and grabs

925
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:42,239
forever more concentrated power

926
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,800
i think i can start if i may

927
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,520
well uh the recent pegasus project

928
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,119
revelations that we have already

929
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:55,359
mentioned during our discussion have

930
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:58,400
indeed demonstrated that as long as

931
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,720
surveillance companies operate with no

932
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,680
limitations and public oversight

933
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:07,200
no activist and journalist isn't safe

934
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,000
from the authoritarian surveillance

935
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
companies enabled

936
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,640
authoritarian regimes to implement

937
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,800
internet shutdowns

938
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,680
like u.s canadian firm

939
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,320
sandvine in batteries

940
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,240
they of course

941
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,359
sold its digital forensic technologies

942
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,760
to the authoritarian regimes including

943
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,720
such

944
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:34,880
firms as celebrate candida and so on

945
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:37,040
so what we need to do

946
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,920
is

947
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,280
first of all to call on governments to

948
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
immediately place a moratorium on the

949
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,960
sale transfer and the use

950
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,160
of surveillance technology and

951
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,640
of course we also recommend to adopt a

952
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,920
sufficient legal framework requiring

953
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:58,160
private surveillance companies and also

954
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,760
their investors

955
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,960
to conduct human rights due diligence

956
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,440
and uphold transparency transparency

957
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:08,640
reports can make a huge difference

958
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:10,240
i would closely align with these

959
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,040
comments i agree very strongly but i

960
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,800
would also encourage

961
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:17,280
civil society to continue to raise

962
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,119
concerns about the fact that governments

963
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:21,520
are addressing these issues through the

964
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,000
very closed door very opaque export

965
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,599
control process

966
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:26,560
and

967
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,440
so the regulation of security and

968
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,599
surveillance technology through export

969
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,839
control means that most of us don't get

970
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:34,800
to see

971
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,960
and understand the detail of what

972
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,880
governments are agreeing to

973
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,040
before it then has to get implemented at

974
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,760
the at the national level so

975
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:46,079
taking surveillance technology and

976
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,200
making it a national conversation

977
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,280
taking the moratorium that anastasia is

978
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,440
calling for and and having that become a

979
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:56,400
part of the broader public debate about

980
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,720
how should these tools be used if at all

981
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:02,320
in a civil society is a really important

982
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,640
issue that does not get enough attention

983
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,520
and so i i think that that can the civil

984
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:10,079
society community was critical uh when

985
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,720
we were fighting uh the the boston our

986
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,599
original rules and export control and it

987
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,119
was a great collaboration between the

988
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:19,119
private sector and civil society to go

989
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:20,880
put pressure on government to change

990
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,880
some of this i think we need to keep

991
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,680
that pressure up because it's it's it's

992
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,720
um

993
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,640
it's an area where it's just really hard

994
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,320
to gain insight

995
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:31,200
when

996
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,320
the export control process is uh is not

997
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,320
the same as a transparent notice of

998
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:38,560
proposed rulemaking or comment period

999
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,440
that

1000
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:43,760
allows us to have a broad public debate

1001
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,560
so kristin anastasia from from what i'm

1002
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:48,160
hearing from both of you it sounds like

1003
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,920
this

1004
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,320
this debate this issue doesn't just uh

1005
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,640
reside in authoritarian regimes or

1006
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:56,720
conflict impacted areas these

1007
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:58,640
conversations need to be having or need

1008
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,560
to be taking place in more open

1009
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,280
democratic or developed countries where

1010
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:06,000
these softwares and hardwares are being

1011
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,720
exported from

1012
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,359
yes exactly

1013
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:12,320
because

1014
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,560
we can't

1015
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:18,800
simply say do not sell to belarus and

1016
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,440
close eyes on all the other violations

1017
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,880
and deals that are happening besides

1018
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,440
of course sometimes when we name and

1019
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,359
change certain

1020
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,480
companies

1021
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:34,880
they indeed uh decide to cease a

1022
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,680
relationship with certain regimes

1023
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:40,079
but at the same time all the equipment

1024
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,320
that have already been sent and

1025
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,119
delivered to these governments are still

1026
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:49,119
in place and still in use so like we

1027
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,920
solved the problems on words and public

1028
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,079
statements but not in essence

1029
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,680
great thank you

1030
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,440
um another question we have from the

1031
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,400
audience uh is regarding data

1032
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,480
the question reads how long should data

1033
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,200
live if we cannot be forgotten our data

1034
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,880
could change hands to parties we

1035
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,000
wouldn't want

1036
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,160
yet if everyone's data expires

1037
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,960
historical records could be difficult

1038
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,480
would anybody like to respond to this

1039
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,800
question

1040
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
i think this is a great question because

1041
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
uh

1042
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,280
at least from a nation-state perspective

1043
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,520
right i'm not a specialist in the human

1044
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,599
rights space and so i do not have the

1045
00:39:31,599 --> 00:39:34,079
history of of the the ramifications of

1046
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:35,680
those issues but if i come at this from

1047
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,200
a nation-state cyber security

1048
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,400
perspective

1049
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:39,440
um

1050
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
you can't look further than solar winds

1051
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,160
for a great articulation of how long you

1052
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,480
think about attack activity

1053
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,720
solar winds was compromised

1054
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,680
and then at some point the the uh

1055
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,920
nobelium the russian attackers

1056
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,960
launched their their software update

1057
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,280
that went out to 18 000 victims and so

1058
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,400
then in

1059
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:01,440
march

1060
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,839
february march april time frame

1061
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,400
of uh 2021

1062
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,920
that started to get installed on

1063
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,920
solarwinds customers

1064
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,960
the attack activity was detected um in

1065
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,000
in late november early december

1066
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,160
of

1067
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,319
2020 sorry i'm off by a year you have to

1068
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,920
forgive me the pandemic means i forget

1069
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,480
all my my years but the broader point is

1070
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:27,680
we went from april until december

1071
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,480
of 2020 before that that activity was

1072
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:33,280
uncovered and victims being notified and

1073
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,079
really finding the depth of that attack

1074
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:40,240
in december and january of 2021. so at

1075
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,359
that point

1076
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:43,760
if you're going back over your data if

1077
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,880
you don't have 18 months worth of logs

1078
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,880
it will be impossible for you to find

1079
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,640
out you know when did that initial

1080
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:54,000
compromise occur how did the attacker

1081
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,160
move on your network did they move

1082
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,440
laterally did they exfiltrate

1083
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:00,319
information and so the retention of that

1084
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,720
information is really really critical

1085
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,880
nation states are you know there's a

1086
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,000
reason why they're called advanced

1087
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,839
persistent threats they are happy to sit

1088
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:11,119
on a network for a long period of time

1089
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,440
and observe collect information remain

1090
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,480
dormant in order to be able to then go

1091
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:19,280
activate an attack in the future and so

1092
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,520
uh the ability to have

1093
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:23,599
at least one if not two years worth of

1094
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,119
forensic data

1095
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:27,920
becomes essential otherwise it's trying

1096
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,520
to like it's like trying to figure out

1097
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,640
where somebody walked after it snowed

1098
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,520
not only once but twice and that becomes

1099
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,000
a real a real challenge so

1100
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,400
uh from a human rights perspective there

1101
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,599
may be uh

1102
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,440
opinions on this that that i am not

1103
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,000
savvy enough to know but from a security

1104
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,280
incident response and forensic

1105
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,839
perspective that's just a recent example

1106
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:53,440
that's that's worth keeping in mind

1107
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,640
yeah let me step in this discussion well

1108
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,800
it's really interesting to hear your

1109
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:01,680
perspective christine really

1110
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,640
but

1111
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,359
let me raise some red flags here

1112
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:08,640
since uh 2014

1113
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:11,119
when the right to be forgotten has been

1114
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:14,560
developed in fact we have witnessed how

1115
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,560
governments

1116
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,319
early authoritarian governments around

1117
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:23,839
the world have misinterpreted and

1118
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:25,359
misimplemented

1119
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:28,640
this right in a way that significantly

1120
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:31,359
harms human rights and leads to more

1121
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:32,720
censorship

1122
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,440
with this in mind we actually do not

1123
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,640
call governments to further develop

1124
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,200
this right to be forgotten but instead

1125
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,319
to focus on developing and reforming

1126
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,200
comprehensive data protection laws

1127
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,640
and

1128
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,920
from

1129
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,440
this fair balance of freedom of

1130
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,960
expression

1131
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,400
we think that under no circumstances

1132
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:57,680
might

1133
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:00,880
must the right to be forgotten be

1134
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,240
applied in a way to enable removal of

1135
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,119
online content because indeed it will be

1136
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:09,359
used by the authoritarian regimes in a

1137
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,240
very very bad way

1138
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,760
we've got

1139
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,079
one final question from our audience

1140
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:19,760
and uh given that we only have a few

1141
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:21,839
minutes left uh please uh keep your

1142
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:23,760
responses uh and

1143
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,400
the shortness of a tweet 140 characters

1144
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,079
or less

1145
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:29,680
what's your advice for human rights

1146
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,839
advocates to persuade companies to open

1147
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:33,680
channels that will be crucial during

1148
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,480
crises and how do activists get past

1149
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,960
company gatekeepers

1150
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:47,920
well to be brief i guess this is the

1151
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,000
concerns that need to be addressed to

1152
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,920
companies themselves

1153
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,240
they need to be open to this dialogue

1154
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:56,480
and do we call on them to open these

1155
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
communication channels

1156
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,200
with civil society because

1157
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:03,440
those on the ground are the only ones

1158
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,760
who are aware of contexts

1159
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:10,480
and content yeah that what's going on

1160
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,839
so yep

1161
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:14,480
this is up to companies

1162
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,440
my uh my tweet size response would be

1163
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,359
for it would be amazing if we could see

1164
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:21,119
the civil society community create an

1165
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,920
isac every critical infrastructure has

1166
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
its own information sharing and analysis

1167
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,280
center where all the key companies or

1168
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:28,560
key participants get together and

1169
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,160
exchange information and then they get

1170
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,960
power of force to be able to get a seat

1171
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,079
at the table with the department of

1172
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:36,000
homeland security with cisa and other

1173
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,079
major sectors i think that it would be

1174
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:40,240
an incredibly powerful thing for civil

1175
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,000
society to come together as an

1176
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:45,040
information sharing and analysis center

1177
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,079
and start

1178
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:48,560
having a larger seat at the table from

1179
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,400
an incident response perspective because

1180
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,640
then you get response at scale which

1181
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:54,800
helps provide

1182
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,720
greater resources and collaboration at

1183
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:58,880
scale and that's something i think will

1184
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,920
be really exciting for the community

1185
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,680
uh yeah i guess the um uh one thing i

1186
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,880
would add uh from the uh uh safe on side

1187
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:13,280
of this would be that um

1188
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,160
uh

1189
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,839
uh you know we have to recognize that

1190
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,880
um most of the stuff that's getting

1191
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,839
blocked is western technology okay

1192
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:23,920
so so uh we should

1193
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:26,400
keep our eye on that um

1194
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,720
and work with um work within uh those

1195
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,319
people be those those groups that are

1196
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,680
getting uh

1197
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,160
you know knocked out by this uh when uh

1198
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,400
russia blocked instagram 80 million

1199
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:39,040
people were knocked off of instagram um

1200
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,640
this is uh

1201
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,119
something that um uh you know is

1202
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:48,319
caught people's eyes so to speak um

1203
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:51,440
uh so let's you know understand that um

1204
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,119
when these attacks are happening they're

1205
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:54,400
actually happening against western

1206
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,480
technology i'm not really not so like

1207
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,760
just i think it's something to take

1208
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,640
forward

1209
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:00,560
um we kind of take it for granted we

1210
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:02,000
think oh facebook's gonna work forever

1211
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:03,359
microsoft's gonna work forever

1212
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:04,560
instagram's gonna work forever all these

1213
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,240
things are gonna work forever meanwhile

1214
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:08,000
they're literally getting attacked by

1215
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,000
every uh authoritarian government there

1216
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,280
is you know

1217
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,400
none of these things can get off the

1218
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,960
ground in certain countries um as a

1219
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,960
result of it so you know let's let's

1220
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:19,040
let's keep that in mind okay uh when

1221
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:21,920
