and i

72
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
wrote this song as a way to

73
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,560
orate and explain the experience of what

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,400
queerness looks like after we've come

75
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,320
out which is where most people think the

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,479
story stops people think that once we've

77
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:45,680
come out and we've been accepted that

78
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,840
our struggles are over however we now

79
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,720
have to enter a world in which we

80
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,880
have to explore our queerness even

81
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,320
though the world is set up in a way that

82
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,840
is very heteronormative and this song is

83
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,080
my way to depict the struggles of

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,600
discovering whether or not we want to

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,280
trust someone

86
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,800
feeling like

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,840
we want to give someone

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,199
vulnerability and the exploration and

89
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,039
the doubt of wondering whether or not

90
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:15,680
they're going to want that back with us

91

feel my love is sinful it is the common

143
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,600
claim that i hear

144
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,480
internationally as to why the lgbtq plus

145
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,640
community shouldn't exist it doesn't

146
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,399
matter where i've been in the world that

147
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,839
has been something that i've been told

148
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:38,480
multiple times that i am sinful for the

149
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,399
way i love

150
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,240
and just like queer was taken back and

151
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,720
reclaimed i want to do the same thing

152
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,240
for sin

153
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,800
because if this is sinful then that's

154
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,959
all i want to feel the love i feel is

155

156

this a sin

[Music]

180
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:08,720
[Music]

181
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,360
we

[Music]

183
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,600
let's find out what this turns out to be

184
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,240
if you're looking for something real we

185
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,959
can make it real

186
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,160
so summer time sin with me some are

187
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,600

188
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,730
so talk with your

189
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:42,540
[Music]

190
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:50,880
[Music]

191
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,320
so talk with your hands

192
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:32,319
[Music]

193
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:39,160
let's find out what this turns out to be

194
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,600
this next song is called prom queen and

195
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,160
my partner insisted

196
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,639
that it has to be played and can only be

197
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,440
played on a banjo

198
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
so here we are

199
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
this is a song in which i wrote

200
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,320
when i was fantasizing about what

201
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,880
reliving my youth would look like how i

202
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,639
would have wanted it to be different

203
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:16,959
especially because i fell under what is

204
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,320
very common

205
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,360
for us queer individuals in which

206
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,399
i

207
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
rejected my queer identity and didn't

208
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,440
give any validation to it and submitted

209
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,240
myself to trying to experience youth the

210
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,760
way i saw my peers do it which was

211
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
drenched in heteronormativity

212
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,360
and it gives me great joy

213
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,639
to

214
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,600
rewrite what i wish my history

215
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
growing up would have looked like where

216
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,199
i could take a girl to prom

217
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,880
where my first kiss

218
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,560
could have been with a girl

219
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,440
and where i could have fallen in love as

220
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,880
a teenager

221
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,800
openly and happily

222
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,720
with another woman

223
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,839
so prom queen is a song

224
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,079
filled to the brim with a lot of queer

225
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:07,440
references

226
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,639
and

227
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,480
i feel like this is like such an

228
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,560
innocent representation

229
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,360
of

230
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,440
what my love feels like as an adult

231
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,639
because it feels like i'm getting to

232
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,079
relive my youth

233
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,880
this is prom queen

234
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:36,389

235
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480

if you'll be

[Music]

243
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,240
maybe in the future

244
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,360
you could be my valentine

245
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:46,320

here to offer a small commercial break i

secondly

282
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,400
if you would like to stay in contact

283
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,640

285
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,960
you can do so in a plethora of ways and

286
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:39,360
you can do so on instagram

287
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,480
or facebook or an occasional twitter

288
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,360
post

289
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,799
a very inconsistent youtube video

290
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:50,160
and an extremely extremely rare

291
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,200
tick tock video

292
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,480
so those are the ways you can stay in

293
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,280
contact with me here at kaimata music

294
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,120
that is almost a universal way to find

295
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,440
me on whatever social media apps there

296
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,240

mission and me

300
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,640
an easy way to do so is to either stream

301
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,720
or purchase my music whether it's

302
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:18,400
through apple or spotify deezer pandora

303
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,720
whatever streaming sites you use

304
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,679
to like listen and share goes a very

305
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,320
long way for independent artists like

306
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,960

now released and it is in collaboration

335
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,320
with an incredible musician and composer

336
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,840
andreas arianto in

337
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,720
indonesia

338
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:45,600
this

339
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,799
honestly is a very personal song to me

340
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,559
in which i was really challenged

341
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,400
musically

342
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,600
however i was also challenged personally

343
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,720
to

344
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,440
try to describe the experience i've

345
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,840
personally had of

346
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,520
falling for

347
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,159
my partner in a way that didn't feel

348
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,960
like i was falling down or falling in

349
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,280
but felt like i was falling upwards in a

350
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
way that defied gravity

351
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,760
and the laws of physics and the world as

352
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,840
i knew it it was a change of

353
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:23,039
how i could see the world i lived in

354
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,679
it didn't feel real it was surreal but i

355
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,280
knew it was what i was experiencing

356
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:32,720
and i really thought that this was

357
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,880
an incredible way to portray it with

358
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:38,400
orchestral sweeps that andreas created

359
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,080
i'm very excited to share it with you
