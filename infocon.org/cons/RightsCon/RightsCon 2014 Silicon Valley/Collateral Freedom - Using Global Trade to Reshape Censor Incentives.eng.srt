1
00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:11,820
so hi everyone welcome to this panel

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,960
discussion on collateral freedom using

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:18,119
local train to change<font color="#CCCCCC"> centers incentives</font>

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,470
so before before i get started sucks

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,580
that's the boy<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm honest I really</font>

6
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:26,689
better<font color="#CCCCCC"> ignored my mind because I'm</font>

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,820
struggling but before I get started

8
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:32,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">substance any of these the amazing panel</font>

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,579
that we had and I than I just wanted to

10
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:37,140
speak to kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of netbook for a minute so</font>

11
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:40,559
<font color="#E5E5E5">you'll notice</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are four people</font>

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">up at six chairs I am mad at Matt but</font>

13
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,930
that's not the reason why there are

14
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:47,670
scared there are as chairs so the people

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,300
in the audience can come on up<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

16
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:54,960
front of conversation fishbowl style and

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,930
I guess the way that that works the way

18
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,510
that works is that anyone who wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

19
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:04,379
come sit we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a brief</font>

20
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:06,298
initial congregation to each of the

21
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:09,000
folks that are seeing up here and then

22
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:12,240
as soon<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we're done with that people</font>

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,220
who come on and hop in and the protocol

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,020
is that for these sort of two I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess</font>

25
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,150
they're called hot scenes and then they

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,080
call them on seats in a fishbowl which

27
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:22,840
seats in Congress but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> could tap</font>

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,250
someone

29
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,990
lawyers not speaking who's in one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

30
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:30,039
these pairs have switched places with

31
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:32,589
them I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people will pop up and join</font>

32
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:36,009
the conversation I should<font color="#E5E5E5"> also tell you</font>

33
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,189
that I'm very aware and quite chagrined

34
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:41,619
that despite having taken a pledge

35
00:01:39,189 --> 00:01:45,000
personally to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of gender</font>

36
00:01:41,619 --> 00:01:48,130
balance on panels of tech conferences I

37
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,659
am ended up organizing a panel but is

38
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:54,130
all men<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I am I can only say that I'm</font>

39

that I'm following burden that it's a

40
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:58,810
both learning experience about the

41
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,209
planning process also a reflection on

three of us and we work on a variety of

49
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:33,310
issues where computer science expertise

50
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,010
is needed by leaders in nonprofits and

the arsenal of purpose-built censorship

interviews let me just do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

101
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:08,520
of stage setting and then let let these

102
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:13,409
folks way in soon we when we were doing

103
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:15,270
this reporter on collateral what became

collateral<font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom at the end of 2012 we</font>

00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:20,370
basically used a snowball method<font color="#CCCCCC"> a small</font>

00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:29,670
I'll tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my expected we would</font>

110
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,100
discover what I expected they were going

111
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:34,560
to tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> us is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most heavily</font>

112

encrypted tools that were purpose-built

<font color="#E5E5E5">to empower people to circumvent barriers</font>

114
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:43,320
like the Great Firewall would be the

115
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,640
most widely<font color="#CCCCCC"> used but what we found and</font>

116
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:48,120
the report is online and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

117
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,710
encourage<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to look to it what we have</font>

118
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,010
them something close to the office to

119
00:05:49,710 --> 00:05:54,750
actually tour and what we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

120
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:59,099
limited time with<font color="#E5E5E5"> each person because we</font>

121
00:05:54,750 --> 00:06:00,660
of course you know we don't behave we

122
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,210
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be tracking who exactly</font>

123
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:04,620
they were because it's in population<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

124
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:07,020
we didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be but remember risk</font>

125
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,330
and so we figured that whatever we have

126
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,219
better take less than five<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes for</font>

127
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:14,580
people in complete so what we ended up

128
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:17,520
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a list of tools going down and</font>

129
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:19,740
then columns going sideways for I use

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,190
this tool within the last 30 days I'm

131
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:26,039
used in<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than 30 days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago or I have</font>

132
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:28,169
never<font color="#E5E5E5"> used this tool and what we found</font>

133
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that most of the things that I</font>

134
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:32,909
thought would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be most widely used in</font>

135
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,530
fact had lots of former users so tour

136
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:36,780
had lots and lots of forum where users

137
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:39,090
but only a handful of current users of

138
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:41,130
my mare<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wisconsin again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stovall sample</font>

140

representative no one knows what<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

141
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,970
sampling frame is so take it with a

142
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:49,710
grain of salt all that said we didn't

143
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:52,080
have diversity across a number of

144
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:55,229
dimensions including geography and the

145
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:57,719
seed sources from which the respondents

146
00:06:55,229 --> 00:06:59,159

is google so it's blocked in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China right</font>

00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:19,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> answer it turns out is that it's</font>

complicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of the things that</font>

00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:37,929
because of the and this gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> into</font>

181
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:39,970
details of how Google's encryption is

182
00:08:37,929 --> 00:08:42,069
implemented but the bottom line is that

183
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:45,130
if you can reach any part of Google's

184

infrastructure the Essex your web

185

Google's infrastructure and going to

188
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:57,340
takes advantage of this we know that if

189
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:00,310
the Chinese government wish to block all

190
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:02,260
data flowing to or from google but it's

191
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,510
technologically trivial for them to do

192
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:07,270
that they know which IP addresses they

193
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,660
would need to drop the packets and you

for VPN and again

197
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:20,390
actually seen a demonstration that the

00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,609
Great Firewall can block the entropy

199
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,460
half of protocol level meaning then

200
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:28,339
without knowing in advance which servers

201
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:30,800

through this through this survey

importance how much disruption would be

219
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:19,310

because these most these most effective

seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> some exciting further discussion of</font>

this positive of this idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it might</font>

229
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:48,950
and I think without I'll turn it over to

230
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:53,959
Jim to offer some thoughts from there

231
00:10:48,950 --> 00:10:57,620
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the further</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ennis's perspective all</font>

232
00:10:53,959 --> 00:11:00,119
right so very good this it's an

233
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:03,600
interesting topic this idea

234
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,900
benefit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in a sense what it means</font>

235
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,250
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I understand the concept is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that by</font>

00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,990
people doing what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're going to do</font>

237
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,690
anyway in other words<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> self-interested</font>

238
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">in selfish and a funny that censorship</font>

239
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:19,589
goes away as economics it uses people<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

240
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,870
act in ways that promote and open

00:11:19,589 --> 00:11:25,110
Internet all it requires all things

242
00:11:21,870 --> 00:11:27,120
scare quotes is that it open<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet be</font>

243
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:29,279
pinched to the right people as the

244
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,760
economically sensible self interesting

245
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,290
thing to do so let me back up and say a

246
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,089
few<font color="#E5E5E5"> words</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> making about how Renesys</font>

247
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,270
approach some of this<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem with data</font>

248
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:40,680
if you don't know Renesys real well

249
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:42,569
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we do is we study the</font>

250
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,400
routing of the internet just letting the

251
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:45,960
performance of the area from very

252
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:49,260
argument where the places around the

253
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:51,089
world we have either<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted as machines</font>

254
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:54,420
or these days being installed as virtual

basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the complete map every day</font>

00:12:16,019 --> 00:12:21,600
the world so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did a study and we had</font>

268
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:24,029
an interesting hypothesis which was that

269
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:26,369
there was a chronicle frontier diversity

270
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:29,429
that would be important in understanding

271
00:12:26,369 --> 00:12:33,779
how vulnerable place was disconnected in

272
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:36,238
a flash like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Egyptians</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down or</font>

all at once right companies aren't

00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,119
supposed to leave<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet all at</font>

276
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,429
once we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> supposed to kind of trick</font>

277
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:47,720
allow regional damages so they kind of

278
00:12:44,429 --> 00:12:50,459
cable but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put me it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very simple</font>

279
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,290
we took every autonomous system on the

like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is not be like level three</font>

283

is not let something like Turk Telekom

<font color="#CCCCCC">kids that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Turkish chaos as we</font>

many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those providers in that country</font>

I've my daughter great statistics

303
00:13:48,129 --> 00:13:53,259
we propose a system by which if you have

304
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:55,959
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> or two providers that talk to you</font>

306
00:13:55,959 --> 00:14:01,449
a severe risk that would be places like

307
00:13:57,939 --> 00:14:03,069
Yemen or Syria with North Korea there's

308

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> being in town it's one</font>

00:14:05,319 --> 00:14:10,748
turn off the internet internet senator

that have a very rare degree of frontier

325

326
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:53,170
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take back to the community in</font>

329
00:14:54,730 --> 00:15:01,090
is that there are specific companies in

providers you guys have internet that's

347
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,190
terrible and it's largely because you

that more and more countries would be

have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that reservoir of diversity so that</font>

in case something were to go terribly

wrong you would have enough on that kind

we can service also determine different

433
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:16,860
what an epic because that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

434
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,020
severe consequences so certainly a tall

435
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:21,810
mountains what I believe is extinct

436
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:25,770
boring but the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that works is</font>

437
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:27,600
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some structural features</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

438
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:30,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">networking and specifically because our</font>

439
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,409
to count them both that they want a

440
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:35,100
sense of us that they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

441
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:38,390
censor it is actually outside so someone

442
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,389
we look at involvements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> happen</font>

443
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:46,290
china and one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we want</font>

444
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:49,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make sure it doesn't happen is as a</font>

448
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,040

00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:11,520
you can shut<font color="#CCCCCC"> down so so that that's what</font>

00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:52,620
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of remarks in my current</font>

role but I also wanted to take a step

465
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,510
back because before joining the

466
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:59,520
government i was in academic and i'll

467
00:20:57,510 --> 00:21:01,830
throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> out a few ideas</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that are maybe</font>

468
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:03,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">Chum for more conversation and maybe we</font>

469
00:21:01,830 --> 00:21:08,419
can get some folks up on stage to

470
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:11,889
discuss them as well from where<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sit we</font>

00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:14,530
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> very excited about this notion</font>

472
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:17,140
by the collateral freedom paper I think

473
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:19,780
being actively experimented upon by

474
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,010
projects like lantern by other projects

475
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:24,370
like I'm sure some of you are familiar

476
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,650
with the folks at great fire and freeway

477
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:28,090
ball that are experimenting with

478
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,670
different techniques seeing how

479
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,919
<font color="#CCCCCC">repressive regimes respond and said I</font>

480
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:36,580
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I think it's a powerful</font>

481
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:39,160
approach to anti-censorship tying that

482
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:43,740
policy consideration back to the

483
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:48,820
economics back to the fundamental

484
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:51,040
benefits the fiscal benefits to regimes

485
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,460
in two individuals finding ways to make

486
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:56,110
those interests align and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's</font>

487
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:59,380
also important<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this world I'll start</font>

488
00:21:56,110 --> 00:22:03,820
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> drift a little bit into the higher</font>

489
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:06,850
level I've empower pontificating but I

490
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that it's important to note to</font>

491
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:15,370
note that the the economics of the

492
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:17,530
internet are at once familiar and new I

493
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:19,360
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the economics of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

494
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:22,120
so we economist have this notion of

495
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,530
network effects that is an<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea that's</font>

496
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:26,350
been around for a long time around

497
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:28,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">different products the idea is the more</font>

498
00:22:26,350 --> 00:22:31,179
people that come on to a particular

499
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,340
platform more value the platform has as

500
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:34,759
a whole so the more people that by fax

501
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:36,349
machine is the more valuable

502
00:22:34,759 --> 00:22:37,969
buying a fax machine is because you can

503
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:41,178
talk to<font color="#CCCCCC"> other people you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send faxes</font>

504
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:43,519
to other people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font>

505
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:46,969
in information technology of various

506
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:49,429
sorts but in other economies as well the

507
00:22:46,969 --> 00:22:53,089
internet adds another layer or layers to

508
00:22:49,429 --> 00:22:55,699
that quite literally in that we have the

509
00:22:53,089 --> 00:22:57,379
infrastructure layer we have the content

510
00:22:55,699 --> 00:22:59,690
layer and we have other neurological

511
00:22:57,379 --> 00:23:01,009
layers in between and innovations are

512
00:22:59,690 --> 00:23:03,079
happening at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those different</font>

513
00:23:01,009 --> 00:23:05,809
layers and those are adding to the value

514
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:10,339
the economic value and the social

515
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:12,979
political value of the network and in

516
00:23:10,339 --> 00:23:16,279
many cases I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think when repressive</font>

517
00:23:12,979 --> 00:23:18,619
regimes seek to shut down activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

518
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:23,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">the internet when they seek to censor</font>

519
00:23:18,619 --> 00:23:24,948
they are trying to avoid they're trying

520
00:23:23,209 --> 00:23:28,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">to stop the activity that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

521
00:23:24,949 --> 00:23:30,379
like without stopping the additional

522
00:23:28,369 --> 00:23:33,139
benefits some of which<font color="#E5E5E5"> are often</font>

523
00:23:30,379 --> 00:23:34,819
unexpected benefits you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> spin-off</font>

524
00:23:33,139 --> 00:23:36,948
ideas that would never could have

525
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:40,519
<font color="#E5E5E5">happened if we didn't have the this poor</font>

526
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:43,249
infrastructure of the internet and so

527
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:46,309
the question is are there ways that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

528
00:23:43,249 --> 00:23:48,669
can structure the way that the internet

529
00:23:46,309 --> 00:23:51,499
works our policies around the internet

530
00:23:48,669 --> 00:23:54,949
that make<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of thinking and</font>

531
00:23:51,499 --> 00:23:56,569
choosing more difficult and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

532
00:23:54,949 --> 00:23:57,979
historically one of the policy

533
00:23:56,569 --> 00:24:00,918
considerations we've got and I'm not

534
00:23:57,979 --> 00:24:03,640
primarily a policy guy although I'm

535
00:24:00,919 --> 00:24:05,920
happy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk policy both</font>

536
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:08,040
one of primary policy considerations

537
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:12,790
we've had when it comes to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

538
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:14,860
around the world is access universal

539
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:16,570
service as we call it in the United

540
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:19,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">States and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we heard this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> morning about</font>

541
00:24:16,570 --> 00:24:20,800
how of course still more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than half of</font>

the world is not connected to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:26,110
internet access to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet is</font>

544
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:26,920
critical but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's also critical giving</font>

545
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:31,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to the point about the</font>

546
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:33,880
balkanization that that access is a true

547
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,500
access to the full internet so it's not

548
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:38,320
just universal<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

549
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,910
unitary access maybe that's not the

550
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,590
right word something something along

551
00:24:39,910 --> 00:24:44,070
those lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that access to the</font>

552
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:48,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Internet means access to the internet</font>

553
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:49,929
and in many cases I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

554
00:24:48,010 --> 00:24:52,870
repressive regimes that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

555
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,370
shut down access to information access

556
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:57,520
to different tools for communication are

557
00:24:54,370 --> 00:25:01,449
trying to break that unitary notion of

558
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:04,080
without breaking breaking the notion of

559
00:25:01,450 --> 00:25:07,900
individuals have access to some network

560
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,480
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think going forward the question is</font>

561
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:12,330
if a clot on freedom approach is going

562
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,520
to be productive<font color="#E5E5E5"> and really effective</font>

563
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,770
how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make those that would seek</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

564
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:20,950
pick and choose<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ways in which the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">internet is used and usable feel the</font>

00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:28,210
full force of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that collateral damage the</font>

567
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:30,400
collateral damage of the network effects

568
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:32,350
the cloud of them and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the unexpected</font>

569
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:34,780
uses that they're not immediately

570
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:37,209
experience I don't have a perfect answer

571
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:40,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that question but I think it's a</font>

572
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:44,529
matter of realigning again

573
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:50,320
send it with with those specific

574
00:25:44,529 --> 00:25:53,080
decisions so that so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the doing</font>

00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:54,730
good and doing well in this case and

576
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,289
aligning with each other and sometimes

577
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:57,970
we can make technical decisions and

578
00:25:56,289 --> 00:26:00,129

would have come in to everyone which is

00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:15,399
a really a policy statement in the

technical clothing but I'll be that I

585
00:26:15,399 --> 00:26:20,289

589
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:32,169
conversation and the meantime<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

590
00:26:28,629 --> 00:26:34,570
say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> as Steve mentioned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work of</font>

591
00:26:32,169 --> 00:26:36,700
great fire<font color="#CCCCCC"> on work and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like just</font>

592
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:39,610
to make sure that we're all aware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

593
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:42,039
<font color="#CCCCCC">view before that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are doing so in</font>

594
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:44,799
specific what they did when Reuters I

595
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:48,429
big<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bloomberg but several Western media</font>

596
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:50,799
outlets were blocked in China what they

597
00:26:48,429 --> 00:26:54,309
decided to do was to mirror the blocked

598
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:59,908
content at at amazon URL so you have to

599
00:26:54,309 --> 00:27:03,370
imagine that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is https secure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 80 us</font>

600
00:26:59,909 --> 00:27:06,879
amazon.com something right and<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

601
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:08,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">beauty of this is that although a sensor</font>

602
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:10,668
can tell that encrypted

603
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:15,049
traffic is going to this amazon web

604
00:27:10,669 --> 00:27:18,289
address the sensor can tell which<font color="#E5E5E5"> David</font>

605
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:22,399
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the sort of difficult</font>

606
00:27:18,289 --> 00:27:24,140
choice as steve was indicating is

607
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:27,370
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> to block the whole thing or not</font>

608
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:29,779
another example of this was a list<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

609
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:31,939
engineers involved in the creation of

610
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:34,960
the great firewall which was censored

611
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:38,179
but then was weird on to get up and

612
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:40,970
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a brief period where the rain</font>

613
00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,519
firewall blocked connectivity to get but

614
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:47,740
as you might imagine this caused an

615
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:52,610
uproar among<font color="#CCCCCC"> Chinese software developers</font>

616
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:55,100
and only lasted about a week and now at

617
00:27:52,610 --> 00:27:58,789
least as up last time I heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this</font>

618
00:27:55,100 --> 00:28:02,658
github is readily accessible<font color="#CCCCCC"> and driving</font>

619
00:27:58,789 --> 00:28:04,820
including the secure page on github that

620
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:06,559
has this list of these engineers some

621
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:09,950
people are saying there should be denied

622
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:15,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">entry to the United States and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so on and</font>

623
00:28:09,950 --> 00:28:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">so I I think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is exciting to see</font>

624
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:20,659
people do lieutenant I should save<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

625
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:22,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">great fire they think they said look</font>

626
00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:24,080
this is why we're doing this that we

627
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:26,600
think this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work in a</font>

628
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">different way so you know I see it as a</font>

629
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:34,779
strategy that is being added to you know

630
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:37,549
the strategic<font color="#E5E5E5"> arseling I think also that</font>

631
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:41,049
one place<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's taking us is toward</font>

632
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:44,269
more attention to cloud providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

633
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:48,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">play a central role in all of this and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

634
00:28:44,269 --> 00:28:51,320
think then for people in the room are

635
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:54,590
elsewhere it neither are working for

636
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,059
working with these organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

637
00:28:54,590 --> 00:29:01,250
in addition to have an enormous impact

638
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:03,950
through just the basic engineering

639
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:06,110
decisions that they make in a way but at

640
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,690
least for me having worked on the survey

641
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:14,520
was a definite

642
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:16,200
/ spended but and so I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure just</font>

643
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:20,670
stop talking until somebody stands out

644
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:24,180
is that the right way that yes yes I I

645
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:27,480
not never better<font color="#E5E5E5"> could I do that I'll</font>

646
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:29,610
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to paralyze all ready yet yeah</font>

647
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:33,300
that's a good sorry I'm sniffling a

648
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:35,550
little bit here<font color="#CCCCCC"> while</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talk but just</font>

649
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:40,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that just to elaborate on the Amazon Web</font>

650
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:42,540
Services<font color="#CCCCCC"> great fire of that war case</font>

651
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:45,570
because i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is interesting in a</font>

652
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:48,360
certain points to some<font color="#CCCCCC"> questions about</font>

653
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:52,679
their that's going to go so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">said great fire org and helped a couple</font>

they're blocked sites audience web

658
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:03,240
services based on this principle that

659
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:05,460
you know too many<font color="#E5E5E5"> chinese companies are</font>

660
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,900
using amazon web services for the

661
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,170
chinese government to block the whole

662
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:14,820
thing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore you know this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

663
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:16,560
good tactic Wow now we have an

664
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:19,409
announcement that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of here last</font>

00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:25,770

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company under Chinese jurisdiction</font>

668
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:31,889
and so on and that's that's where sort

of the Amazon collateral freedom kind of

github doesn't have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> commercial</font>

673
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,580
first in China right it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

674
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:47,980
salivating about all is this it can do

00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:50,850
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> China and all the prophets it can be</font>

676
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:54,910
by doing business with Chinese companies

677
00:30:50,850 --> 00:30:57,129
amazon you know sees a big attacked you

678
00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">know market in China wants to do a lot</font>

679
00:30:57,130 --> 00:31:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">more business or a lot more Chinese</font>

680
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:06,190
companies but in order to do that

681
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:09,100
there's there's a worry you know amongst

682
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,840
those who have been using Amazon Web

683
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:15,070
Services not just great fire the others

684
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:17,649
if you know to host content that they

685
00:31:15,070 --> 00:31:19,510
want to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> on blog</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abul that the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Chinese government made say okay you</font>

00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:26,110
want to come<font color="#E5E5E5"> into China you now need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

688
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:30,280
respond to our West to take down certain

689
00:31:26,110 --> 00:31:32,469
accounts or you know to to cancel

690
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:34,830

users or you know etcetera etc and it's

693
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:42,310
when a company starts having a big

694
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:44,169
business interest in a country even if

695
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:46,690
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not hosting the content in that</font>

696

jurisdiction they start having to make

697
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:51,540
compromises and you've seen this with

698
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:55,030
quite a number of other companies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

699
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:57,820
there is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question of whether great</font>

fires amazon web hosting strategy is

00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:07,330
further along and you know amazon it's

00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:07,919
not remember the global network

it hasn't been<font color="#CCCCCC"> willing to kind of have</font>

dialogue or<font color="#E5E5E5"> sir to make public</font>

707

process for handling government requests

709
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:22,950
do they have plans new transparency

710
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:25,260
reporting do they have plans to have

711

dialogue with the human rights community

712
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,230
about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> there can handle data how</font>

they're going to handle takedowns you

714
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:37,710
know how they're going to handle these

715
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:40,380
issues in a responsible manner they are

716
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:42,000
not among the companies who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,950
that conversation you're not going to

00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,350
see the pier having that conversation I

719
00:32:43,950 --> 00:32:51,240
don't think far as I haven't seen it

720
00:32:46,350 --> 00:32:57,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">again this and you know so so that's a</font>

721
00:32:51,240 --> 00:33:01,380
real problem that as some kind of

722
00:32:57,540 --> 00:33:05,340
seemingly unblockable companies start to

benefits are blocking out the

810
00:37:11,940 --> 00:37:18,120

811
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:19,920
think that's an excellent it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great</font>

point about the trade barriers issue

this is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you str you know</font>

with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese about their WBO WTO</font>

818
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:38,549
go anywhere because<font color="#CCCCCC"> what WTO victories</font>

819
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:40,709
allow you to do is impose retaliatory

820
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:42,750
tariffs of a bottom line is that the

821
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:45,240
United States is not interested in

822
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:47,610
getting into reciprocal retaliating

823
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrots basically the Chinese even if</font>

824
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,810
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their derogation of WTO</font>

825
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:55,069
obligations we may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be legally entitled</font>

826
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:59,100
to do so under the WPO treaty framework

827
00:37:55,070 --> 00:38:02,550
but i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i mean the balkanization</font>

828
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:06,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">concern</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i would without in any</font>

way apologizing for smiling upon being

830
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,910
those sort of ladder and the newer

831
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:13,860
balkanization efforts that we're seeing

832
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:15,629
out of places like brazil<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would</font>

833
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:17,640
distinguish those from what we see in

834
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:20,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">china in a couple of respects that</font>

835
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:26,000
strength is getting likely<font color="#E5E5E5"> to matter I</font>

836
00:38:20,790 --> 00:38:30,270
mean one is that as far as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm aware the</font>

837
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brazil well I guess yeah you can ask the</font>

838
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:34,680
question so if they<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you know users</font>

839
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,200
have to put you nokia<font color="#CCCCCC"> Brasilia users you</font>

840
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:38,149
have to store their data

841
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:40,609
and facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> says well that's not our</font>

842
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:42,500
practice then what right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Brazil</font>

843
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:45,950
going to block is actually Brazil going

844
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:48,020
to block facebook as far as I have heard

845
00:38:45,950 --> 00:38:50,990
and I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe others I don't</font>

846
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:53,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">even I don't know following it yeah</font>

847
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:55,700
so so sodium city is this something

848
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:57,319
where they're saying you know people in

849
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:59,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brazil are saying look if you don't put</font>

850
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:01,579
your servers here we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to block</font>

851
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">Brazilians access to you so the dialogue</font>

852
00:39:01,579 --> 00:39:05,900
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> still ongoing about what the remedies</font>

853
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:07,670
would be you don't put your servers in

854
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">their zone the challenger leaves in a</font>

commercially significant traffic as a

promising approach I would look to you

know potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle market countries</font>

Keenan<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a high priority lists like</font>

941
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:10,700
Vietnam for example as potentially

00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:13,190
promising places in terms of providing

943
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,529
you know and some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty basic</font>

944
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:18,650
right i mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone has amazon but has</font>

anyone taken you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know stuff that's in</font>

it available via this mechanism you know

948
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:26,930
that's that's I think a question that

949
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,540
could be asked you to have a number of

950

and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know i mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> brazil's it</font>

951
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:35,630
if it's a fascinating case because right

952
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:38,420
there they have this appetite for that's

953
00:43:35,630 --> 00:43:40,820
when I think you know if the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sad</font>

955
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:45,890
know then we have a subsequent question

956
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,330
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know to what extent of</font>

these other<font color="#E5E5E5"> countries have the kind of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">venture technical talent that China has</font>

replicas of somebody on these services

00:43:55,340 --> 00:44:00,200
and I mean perhaps Brazil does but I

962
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,890
mean there are probably a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

American school children so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

their system because schools would

complain the very sense the wells get be

one is clearly there is a economic

lets them complete a policy that they're

pursuing and keep the good bits flowing

bought YouTube a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> country it rises</font>

up as one once there

videos about believe you can if you can

993
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:29,790
block at narrow URL you could block some

other image it's when the recent<font color="#E5E5E5"> HTTPS</font>

995
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:37,440
is so important then if you minimize the

00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:39,209
effect to everything else then that it's

997
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,400
a better censorship system from that

998
00:45:39,210 --> 00:45:45,120
point of view it seems to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

999
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:46,620
this approach falls into that subset of

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they know they already</font>

1001
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:54,720
have to do which is to peel away the bad

1002
00:45:51,510 --> 00:45:57,000
content and left a actually calls a

1006
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:15,690
it's crucial that we have a way to make

1007
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,700
that argument I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's in</font>

1008
00:46:15,690 --> 00:46:20,310
some way it's different it's a sort of a

00:46:21,870 --> 00:46:26,670
kind of narrowing you know harder to do

there's collateral damage if you've got

1048
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:10,789
interesting about the peer-to-peer angle

1049
00:48:09,079 --> 00:48:13,940
I'm sorry I manifest from also from

<font color="#CCCCCC">Lantern is just that not only is it the</font>

case that there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are these companies that</font>

1052
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,069
have services that remain on block

1053
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:21,680
because there's this collateral damage

1054
00:48:19,069 --> 00:48:23,180
but you also have BitTorrent that's

1055
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,859
unblocked in all of these regions so

1056
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:26,960
there's this collateral damage to

1057
00:48:24,859 --> 00:48:28,250
blocking even things that aren't

1058
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,530
necessarily see initially as

1059
00:48:28,250 --> 00:48:32,599
economically important but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1060
00:48:30,530 --> 00:48:34,099
of China may actually be particularly

1061
00:48:32,599 --> 00:48:36,109
economically valuable from the

1062
00:48:34,099 --> 00:48:37,730
perspective of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese government</font>

1063
00:48:36,109 --> 00:48:39,950
not having a vested interest in

1064
00:48:37,730 --> 00:48:42,440
protecting us copyright law for example

1065
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:46,129
so you have this huge influx of value

1066
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:50,180
into China by keeping BitTorrent

1067
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:51,890
unblocked and would you circulate that

1068
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:56,390
that has entered maybe into their

1069

interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's the only other</font>

1072
00:48:59,150 --> 00:49:04,430
example i can think of of a service that

1073
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:07,130
stays unblocked and I'd have to guess

1074
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:09,618
that it is due to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same collateral</font>

1075
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:12,349
freedom thesis that there is is cost to

1076
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:15,140
blocking it that's real agent another

sort of baby else in like a week form of

1078
00:49:15,140 --> 00:49:20,450
the hypothesis also would just be that

1079
00:49:17,089 --> 00:49:23,450
these are folks who know how to filter

1080
00:49:20,450 --> 00:49:24,368
and block and impose constraints inside

1081
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:25,749
their domestic

1082
00:49:24,369 --> 00:49:27,249
are going to be an arguably the world

1083
00:49:25,749 --> 00:49:30,279
leader among the countries in so doing

1084
00:49:27,249 --> 00:49:33,899
and and yet you don't see any effort at

1085
00:49:30,279 --> 00:49:39,640
all to block this this this peer-to-peer

unfortunately go the other way somebody

who has a very valuable high-value

1101

00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:25,509
because of the potential that I'm going

<font color="#E5E5E5">to attract blockage because of the newer</font>

do you ever do see that at being

1111
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:46,180
similar to this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I noticed that linkedin</font>

has just opened the China a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese</font>

operation and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> remember they were</font>

1114
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:55,900
earlier on they were making<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussions</font>

1115
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:57,240
about whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> to send servers in or how</font>

1116
00:50:55,900 --> 00:50:59,830
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1117
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:02,169
and one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their big problems earlier on</font>

1118
00:50:59,830 --> 00:51:04,330
was that they're one of their biggest

1119
00:51:02,170 --> 00:51:06,850
features in the West was that you could

1120
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,910
connect your Twitter account and the

1121
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:12,700
problem was was the folks in China were

1122
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:15,060
using LinkedIn as a way of getting a

1123
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,259
mirror to Twitter that was blocked so

1124
00:51:15,060 --> 00:51:20,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">leeton was actually being blocked</font>

1125
00:51:17,260 --> 00:51:24,600
because it was acting as a as a

1126
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:27,520
underground railroad for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 44 tweets and</font>

1127
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:29,500
and so the question that they were

1128
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,530
asking is well should we shut this off

1129
00:51:29,500 --> 00:51:35,500
and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course you know our response is</font>

1130
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">no keep it up but the wider past is that</font>

1131
00:51:35,500 --> 00:51:40,390
at that point linkedin as a complete

1132
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:41,620
service was going to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be was going to be</font>

1133
00:51:40,390 --> 00:51:45,700
Bob to China I don't know how they

1134
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:47,200
resolve that but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that apply my</font>

1135
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:51,750
shiny thought they posted a blog post

1136
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,750
last me this is what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> referring to</font>

1137
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:02,920
they say I think they're Chinese service

1138
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:05,830
has limited features like it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't</font>

1139
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:08,140
offer all<font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures I i think the restive</font>

1140
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:09,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think that was actually the solution</font>

1141
00:52:08,140 --> 00:52:12,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went to from that period which</font>

1142
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:14,950
is they were basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> created a</font>

first question was there

00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:51,410
yes if about not walking full countries

1150
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:55,089
for putting our region's that's

00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,089
interesting to Chinese some of the today

1152
00:52:56,279 --> 00:52:59,339
sort of

<font color="#E5E5E5">there to hold one community in countries</font>

1154

where the rocks are not

1155
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:21,070
regions and arguments annotations so I

1156
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,600
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> I not sure if I caught both</font>

1157
00:53:21,070 --> 00:53:25,119
questions back to this question

1158
00:53:22,600 --> 00:53:26,618
specificity yes we can track things down

1159
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:29,260
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the city level we got a great example</font>

1160
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:31,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Venezuelan instance recently where</font>

1161
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,160
there were some routing outages very

1162
00:53:31,780 --> 00:53:34,900
brief they were affecting particular

1163
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:37,089
province to province world problems were

1164
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,800
and it turned out that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe that</font>

1165
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably the government had taken off</font>

1166
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,670
one of their main facilities was inside

1167
00:53:40,810 --> 00:53:46,180
the address block that was unrounded and

1168
00:53:42,670 --> 00:53:48,190
so it was quickly put back up so it's

1169
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:50,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">true you can you can't exercise fairly</font>

1170
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:52,270

1174
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:02,340
and yeah you see that a lot the model of

1175
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:04,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the name was really about</font>

1176
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:08,950
country-by-country disconnection is sort

1177
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:10,600
of the kill switch concept to death but

1178
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:13,808
you're right<font color="#E5E5E5"> it has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> become a much more</font>

1181
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:28,299
for one more question if it's the last

1182
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:30,189
one or not only thing everyone were for

1183
00:54:28,299 --> 00:54:32,380
being here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if people want to talk</font>

1184
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:38,649
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this oh I'm sorry there sorry</font>

1185
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:40,839
baby last second buddy TI p value the

1186
00:54:38,650 --> 00:54:44,739
maze were denied service by Rackspace

1187
00:54:40,839 --> 00:54:48,189
when we try to get hosting with them<font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

1188
00:54:44,739 --> 00:54:49,930
no real reason given me maybe we were we

1189
00:54:48,189 --> 00:54:52,058
would be violating terms of service or

1190
00:54:49,930 --> 00:54:56,828
<font color="#E5E5E5">maybe they didn't want us hurting their</font>

1191
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:59,589
their other customers also<font color="#CCCCCC"> I too I</font>

1192
00:54:56,829 --> 00:55:02,739
wonder so sort of variation on that if

1193
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:05,799
there's a danger of us tipping the

1194
00:55:02,739 --> 00:55:08,289
collateral value on in some cases for

1195
00:55:05,799 --> 00:55:10,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">example we use digital ocean languages</font>

1196
00:55:08,289 --> 00:55:12,339
digital ocean they're pretty cheap we're

1197
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:14,680
all pretty poor I bet<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the other</font>

1198
00:55:12,339 --> 00:55:17,469
I bet some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the other organizations</font>

1199
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:19,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">like dice used it'll ocean I have no</font>

1200
00:55:17,469 --> 00:55:23,199
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea what percentage of their total user</font>

1201
00:55:19,779 --> 00:55:25,359
base client<font color="#CCCCCC"> face we are but there might</font>

1202
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:29,949
come a point where just blocking digital

1203
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:31,449
oceans IP space might become not a

1204
00:55:29,949 --> 00:55:34,109
collateral not sufficient collateral

1205
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:37,650
damage

1206
00:55:34,109 --> 00:55:40,859
and then by way a final comment i do

1207
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:43,589
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to refer back to Rebecca's comments</font>

1208
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:45,239
about how sustainable these current

1209
00:55:43,589 --> 00:55:46,950
experiments with flower of freedom are

1210
00:55:45,239 --> 00:55:48,960
and to what extent they align with

1211
00:55:46,950 --> 00:55:51,589
business incentives<font color="#E5E5E5"> because I think a</font>

1212
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:56,089
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this will come down to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not just</font>

1213
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:58,680
how do we proactively try to align

1214
00:55:56,089 --> 00:56:01,380
freedom and freedom traffic for lack of

1215
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:03,960
a better term with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economic</font>

1216
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:06,839
incentives of nation states but with

1217
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:10,200
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> large companies that operate within</font>

1218
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:13,650
those jurisdictions and face issues with

1219
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:15,299
people on the ground so likewise you

1220
00:56:13,650 --> 00:56:17,579
need to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the alignment of</font>

1221
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:20,059
economic incentives there and I breathe

1222
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:22,470
it we have a looming potential challenge

1223
00:56:20,059 --> 00:56:24,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">thanks to everyone and we're all still</font>
