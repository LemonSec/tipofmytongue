00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,540
this is the state for how to get shit

<font color="#E5E5E5">done without killing each other</font>

00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,769
hopefully completely wishes remains so

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,300
if you've never<font color="#E5E5E5"> heard before and you've</font>

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,160
never talked to me before this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,230
basically what<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do i do a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of print</font>

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,570
stuff in to promote free speech and

circumvent censorship<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work on stuff</font>

9
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:22,050
like emotion wireless which you probably

10
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:24,630
be seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the conference a little</font>

bit as to work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> cupcake I worked</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

14
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:32,098
I also occasionally lend my time to the

15
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,399
AIDS policy project which is an amazing

16

organization promoting<font color="#E5E5E5"> AIDS research and</font>

17
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,559
things of that nature<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

18
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,440
collaboration is really fucking hard you

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:45,000
know we've got like big personalities

20
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:46,968
ideological issues we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> logistical</font>

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,640
issues that will never<font color="#E5E5E5"> really go away</font>

22
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:54,570
and on top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all those other things we</font>

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,699
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with paranoia so</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">about I'm sorry close again</font>

completely legitimate reasons I know

lots of people even<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped every time</font>

34
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:28,770
they cross the border I know<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

spend<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years getting you know special</font>

nothing wrong may have no criminal

people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that sort of leave the sort of</font>

can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on one level I have to</font>

extent leaving a certified tech

48
00:01:57,220 --> 00:02:00,789
community because of paranoia is like

49
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:03,220
living right now because you keep

00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:04,720
running<font color="#E5E5E5"> into gay men I mean it's such a</font>

51
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:06,550
feature in the landscape that you should

52
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,830
probably accept it before<font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever step</font>

53
00:02:06,550 --> 00:02:10,620
foot in it or at least be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set</font>

54
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:13,209
some sort of personal boundaries you

55
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:15,700
know so paranoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this community</font>

00:02:13,209 --> 00:02:17,110
results<font color="#E5E5E5"> from serious abuse of power both</font>

57
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:18,790
in government and in the private sector

58
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,590
and it's great to go in the other room

59
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,329
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> here at Google you know talk</font>

60
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:24,310
endlessly about how they really<font color="#E5E5E5"> care</font>

61
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your privacy meanwhile they're</font>

62
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">running all of the data that passes</font>

63
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:30,280
through their systems in order to make

64
00:02:27,610 --> 00:02:32,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">money off of you so there's a bit of a</font>

65
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,750
trade-off there but you also have to

66
00:02:32,799 --> 00:02:37,450
deal<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> govern your parents people</font>

67
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:38,850
sending you know nsl requests for your

00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,790
data you'll know

69
00:02:38,850 --> 00:02:44,220
that unless you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like a known</font>

70
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,709
figure it's incredibly unlikely to ever

71
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,390
know if there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a secret order for</font>

72
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:52,920
your accounting and you can do

everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> is dad so you know again it</font>

74
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,970
makes sense that people get kind of

75
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:59,340
paranoid infiltration<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a big issue but</font>

76
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,510
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been like you know the greatest</font>

77
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:02,460
urge to this community is the fact that

78
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:04,769
we get so wrapped up in this this drama

79
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">suspicions about each other that it</font>

80
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,730
reduces our operational capacity

81
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:15,959
remarkably I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

82
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:19,320
something to consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so</font>

83
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,060
collaboration is hard and we all deserve

84
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:23,579
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of credit for not being you know</font>

85
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,470
paranoid<font color="#E5E5E5"> Psychopaths and dangerous</font>

86
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,750
criminals because we all probably could

87
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:29,790
should be after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we spend five or ten</font>

88
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:34,560
years dealing with hackers and things

89
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:36,209
like that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> let's be really big</font>

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,370
personalities let's start without them

91
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:40,290
let's be real a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us have big</font>

92
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:42,360
personalities and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually a real</font>

93
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,370
asset in a reader like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

94
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">present</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and promote and explain and</font>

95
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,940
train people to use tools and like we

96
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,010
frequently work with people with

97
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,690
dangerous areas like Texas and this

98
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:55,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">really helps to have sort of a big</font>

99
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:58,650
personality and like this is exuberance

100
00:03:55,110 --> 00:04:00,420
about us you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> with big flare big</font>

101
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,570
personalities frequently comes big egos

102
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:06,179
and big drama I'm not exempt from this I

103
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:07,530
am sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a drama magnet at times I try</font>

104
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:09,990
to dissipate it as much as I can but

105
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:12,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">that only works a little bit and I do</font>

106
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:14,280
have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of tiny tiny bit of</font>

107
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">anything you know this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

108
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">happens</font>

109
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,430
you will deal with people every day you

110
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">know are constantly concerned with</font>

111
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:23,820
either in their image or how they're

112
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,740
perceived or they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> center</font>

113
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,540
of attention it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> future one team</font>

114
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,670
but you know one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to keep in mind</font>

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:35,880
is like the most contentious people into

116
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:39,150
space there's people they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> friends</font>

117
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,740
they have fun like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are just</font>

118
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:43,560
people they went take themselves super

119
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:45,960
super seriously but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> none of them</font>

120
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that serious and this is essentially</font>

121
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">a shot of the the first</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

122
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,960
Torah sweater club that we're literally

123
00:04:50,610 --> 00:04:54,570
like five developers walking around

124
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,400
these crazy-ass Icelandic sweaters it

125
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,030
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really amazing I'm really</font>

126
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:03,870
that Isle being somewhat that<font color="#E5E5E5"> book so</font>

127
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:07,169
they'll take everybody too seriously so

128
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:09,150
let's yeah big personalities big

129
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:11,100
personalities big contention lots of

130
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,169
people hate each other okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever</font>

131
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,170
let's talk about the art walk this is

132
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:18,210
actually it worked so the art model is

133
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,800
accelerated research collaboration and

134
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:22,109
it's used<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the biomedical</font>

135
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,960
sciences and by a lot i mean it's been

136
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:27,690
used pretty successfully but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hasn't</font>

137
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,370
gotten this broad adoption people like

138
00:05:27,690 --> 00:05:32,520
the violent<font color="#CCCCCC"> Research Foundation use this</font>

139
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:35,370
all the time and two amazing success and

140
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,409
<font color="#CCCCCC">Tom's not come at any moment but that</font>

141
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,480
just is with the art model you take two

142
00:05:37,410 --> 00:05:41,970
researchers from different labs you

143
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:43,890
force them to work together remember

144
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:46,590
these people have been you know

145
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:48,419
competitors maybe 20 years they're all

146
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,840
at the top of their field they're all

147
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:51,219
really competitive

148
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,690
for the same grants fighting for the

149
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:55,600
same money fighting them same

150
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:58,150
publications for decades they fucking

151
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,949
hate each other but you force them to

152
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,229
work together you give them a big grant

153
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:04,600
to do so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> make them share data and</font>

154
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:07,870
somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the magic</font>

155
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:09,340
happens a lot of times you know years of

156
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,830
resentment and frustration to sort of

157
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:15,250
dissipate but on top<font color="#CCCCCC"> of everything</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else</font>

165
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:34,900
wanted to actually put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this into place</font>

Saturday David fin field who writes

00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:07,000
network stuff here at a political

transport to incorporate land trip with

181
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:10,990

it work anymore you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> lantern as a</font>

183
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:14,979
fallback these are two competitors

184
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:16,510
they're working together they've made

185
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:18,940
something amazing this could save

186
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:22,090
people's lives you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes it</font>

187
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,800
really helps to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just move beyond what</font>

188
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:25,840
you think your circumstances are and

189
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:30,070
this competitive nature that's in the

190
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:33,070
community and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> just explodes</font>

191
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:36,190
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so there's kind of a</font>

192
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:38,590
buddy story over this you know we have a

193
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:41,260
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of ideological issues that sort of</font>

194
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,700
like clash like there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of us are</font>

195
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,250
anarchists and one of us are kind of

196
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:46,719
capitalist and we've got my start to the

197
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:48,669
medics and businesses and we've got

198
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,780
policy people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know they'd always</font>

199
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:51,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">got the kisser taking money from the</font>

200
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:53,200
state department and how does that make

201
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">you feel and you know all this other</font>

202
00:07:53,200 --> 00:08:00,039
stuff so let's fight about maybe there's

203
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:01,419
a you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> in pain sectors and</font>

204
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:05,409
there's a lot of really great stories

205
00:08:01,419 --> 00:08:07,830
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> people and one of them you know</font>

206
00:08:05,409 --> 00:08:10,120
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 years ago two people with</font>

207
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:11,890
really heavy in the space in San

208
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,300
Francisco and it just they were

209
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:16,090
basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected their alarms and</font>

210
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,099
they had advanced HIV disease and one

211
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:20,109
was an anarchist and one was a socialist

212
00:08:18,099 --> 00:08:25,450
we got into a fucking this fight and

213
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:27,130
broke each other spaces over ideology so

214
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:29,169
you know part of the struggle is about

215
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:31,349
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep people who are actively</font>

216
00:08:29,169 --> 00:08:34,088
dying from killing each other over

217
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:37,360
ideological differences and I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

218
00:08:34,089 --> 00:08:39,610
I have a solution for that but I think

219
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it's worth noting that this is not</font>

220
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:46,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a a hacker server mention tech</font>

221
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">depression type situation I think this</font>

222
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:54,010
occurs everywhere but we need to try to

223
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,630
domestic<font color="#CCCCCC"> skip set compatibility this is</font>

224
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:58,870
actually a tender issue for a lot of

225
00:08:55,630 --> 00:09:01,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">people you know have you ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

226
00:08:58,870 --> 00:09:02,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">outdoor project like if you ever started</font>

227
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:05,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">early ground floor or something and</font>

228
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,140
you're like you know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

229
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:08,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">kind of like</font>

230
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">i groped me on this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> project i need to</font>

231
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:14,810
focus on larger things as a project up

232
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:18,050
from you you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was like one of the</font>

233
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:21,319
first people to test for yoga at two

234
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:24,979
years heads the project totally out room

235
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:27,590
like all the way and so it's kind of

236
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,000
tributed like navigate this thing of yes

237
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:31,220
I really like you yes I really your

238
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:34,400
project but we're in two totally

239
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:36,020
different spaces so I think the key here

240
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,959
is actually consider alternative ways of

241
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:41,150
collaborating you know something gets

242
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,610
totally rewritten in Python and all you

243
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:47,240
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> is PHP and you have a substantial</font>

244
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:48,830
you know history with the project can

245
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,720
you do community<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff are you a</font>

246
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:52,550
designer can you just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give moral support</font>

247
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,530
and be like hey you guys are doing a

248
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:57,560
kick-ass job if you need somebody to

249
00:09:54,530 --> 00:10:00,079
test let me know just work on different

250
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,660
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> of operating over-communicate say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

251
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:05,150
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's time that I you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

252
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,250
worked in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> other fashion or I think</font>

253
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:09,829
that the project<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be like this if</font>

254
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:13,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">you do you think that way or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

255
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:16,400
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> like that and I think the key</font>

256
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:17,630
thing here I see this all the time don't

257
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:20,720
lose a friendship over stupid

258
00:10:17,630 --> 00:10:23,210
open-source bullshit it's like if you

259
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:25,640
can maintain friendships over the course

260
00:10:23,210 --> 00:10:27,470
of life by over 10 years you'll find the

261
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:29,360
play actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know go way beyond</font>

262
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">projects you can collaborate in</font>

263
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,660
different ways you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might stop vibrating</font>

264
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,829
entirely but still remain friends and

265
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:39,030
still be open and active it

266
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:40,710
definitely and their logistical issues I

267
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:46,470
had someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> else p recently why don't we</font>

268
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:48,210
communicate by a pond like really so if

269
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:51,420
those of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know pond is actually</font>

270
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:54,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">a highly highly technical piping</font>

271
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,829
unusable highly unstable piece of

272
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:57,600
encryption software that is very

273
00:10:55,830 --> 00:11:00,300
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get going as a</font>

274
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,600
thing and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> communicate at</font>

275
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,339
odd intervals and things like that it's

276
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,400
nice but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really manage a</font>

277
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:11,100
project that way so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to give some</font>

278
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:17,340
tips of logistical issues for project

279
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:19,230
owners and four and four volunteers for

280
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:23,040
project owners breakdown project needs

281
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:25,620
into tiny bits if you say we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to we</font>

282
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,140
need racks course it look like GT logo

283
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:30,300
geo<font color="#CCCCCC"> hold website design do you print</font>

284
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:31,800
design it sounds obvious but you need to

285
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,150
break down exactly what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need and</font>

286
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,490
want otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'll have somebody</font>

287
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,069
making like a how-to guide giving you

288
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:41,460
PDFs and giving you PSD files and you're

289
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,220
like great i'll never use this but you

complicated they'll never get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it they'll</font>

yes

332
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:22,370
and that's the the NSA scandal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

aftermath re-enacted by five girls then

00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,370
everything's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that</font>

335
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:28,569
straightforward I work on cupcake which

336
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:32,060
is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrapper for flash proxy which is a</font>

337
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:33,140
very complicated proxying system that

338
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:34,760
creates bridges for the Tor network

339
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,130
which is itself incredibly complicated

340
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:51,080
and I mean regulated painting so I'm

341
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:55,670
saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jim no just kind of</font>

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as complicated as it is for</font>

344
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,100
project owner split them up you have to

345
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,300
know what your limitations are are you

346
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,830
gonna have to learn a hole in their

347
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:06,740
library if you want to implement this

348
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:09,710
feature for this project what happens if

349
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:12,350
you do it wrong what happens if you you

350
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:13,760
learn the library but then you know your

351
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:15,260
feature is all that great or it is it

352
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,000
necessary or you know something like

353
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:19,160
that so sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Trent planted your work</font>

354
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,320
out in advance I fallen into this

00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:24,620
traveling at that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was intelligence so I</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that they have everything coated today</font>

361
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:35,660

that earlier I've seen it happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> it its</font>

388
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:31,600
thing and don't max out your available

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> at like a hundred percent capacity</font>

but we need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be at less than eighty</font>

393

percent capacity you know you need to

394
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:44,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">become the master of know and that's</font>

00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,089
easier said<font color="#E5E5E5"> than done that I get that</font>

396
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:47,980
you are the one<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says your own</font>

397
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:50,950
priorities and you need to stick to them

398
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:52,769
that's not just good for you that's good

399
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,249
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> projects you work on</font>

empty space into your schedule chaos

403
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:07,980
theory the physicists were right so

404
00:17:06,449 --> 00:17:10,500
they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> been employing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just an</font>

endless number of random unplanned

things that have occurred around me and

various people that I work with like you

you're maxing out your time also<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

418
00:17:39,149 --> 00:17:43,649
really funny story that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I found out</font>

419
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:45,570
yesterday was I me on a video open

420
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:47,129
source project they had an anonymous

421
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:49,710
contributor that nobody who knew this

422
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:52,620
person was and what happened was that

423
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,419
their laptop and their backup<font color="#CCCCCC"> drive and</font>

424
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">the USB keys were sitting on the same</font>

425
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:01,500
table for a few hours and his first came

426
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:04,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">up so basically they disappeared</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

427
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,929
the ether and couldn't prove who they

428
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:09,959
were and didn't really reach out for a

429
00:18:06,929 --> 00:18:12,000
couple of months so then it was person

430
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,370
who has deliverables and deadlines and

453
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of the most of the things that help</font>

454
00:19:45,179 --> 00:19:48,719
are simply putting yourselves an

455
00:19:47,309 --> 00:19:51,779
environment or you can see someone is

456
00:19:48,719 --> 00:19:54,629
well-rounded if you have to work right

457
00:19:51,779 --> 00:19:57,239
next to someone for like two days you're

458
00:19:54,629 --> 00:19:59,428
less likely to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

463
00:20:04,889 --> 00:20:08,998
that person or if you only think that

464
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:11,099
like once in a coffee shop and they're a

465
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,799
jerk<font color="#CCCCCC"> is they're having a bad dad you</font>

466
00:20:11,099 --> 00:20:16,080

468
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,529
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they see people as well-rounded</font>

469
00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:21,149
as the best is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> closest thing you're</font>

470
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:23,070
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get and if it takes a workshop</font>

471
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:25,320
to do that then it does and potatoes

472
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,320
nagar led facilitation<font color="#E5E5E5"> whom to do that</font>

473
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:31,200
but it does and if it requires you all

474
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:33,359
to go to you know hawaii as part of

475
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,339
whisper systems than it does you know

476

477
00:20:35,339 --> 00:20:39,839
artificially shove people together in

478
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:41,549
each new configurations and sometimes

479
00:20:39,839 --> 00:20:44,370
some really amazing collaboration to

480
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:48,540
come out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and some time</font>

481
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:51,030
it but usually they do it so I think

482
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:53,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's all I think I talk at top speed</font>

483
00:20:51,030 --> 00:20:56,480
for half an hour<font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> questions so</font>

484
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:56,480
