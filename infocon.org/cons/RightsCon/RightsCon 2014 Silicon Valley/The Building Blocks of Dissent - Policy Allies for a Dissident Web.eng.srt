you'll indulge me because it kind of

there will be freedom of speech even if

00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:24,509
the law forbids it but of public opinion

29
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,970
is sluggish inconvenient minorities will

30
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,570

what you say that it will defend to the

00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,240

to other men

37
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:50,890
so basically this is my interpretation

38
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,170
government has a proactive role in

39
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:55,590
protecting free speech and promoting to

up the to put the failure of the Occupy

can discuss the issue of dissident media

128
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:03,128
of us of straw man but is this idea that

129
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,389
you can these problems that exist with

132
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:14,439
there saying that you know we can't rely

00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:16,779
policy you look in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States at</font>

incredibly corrupt it is failed to

136
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:26,800
protect consumers and therefore we need

137
00:06:25,209 --> 00:06:29,289
to find alternative solutions and

138
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:32,800
technology and the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> argument is</font>

00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:35,139
that you need structural policy in order

00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,999
for some of the things that panel has

141

00:06:47,589 --> 00:06:51,249
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> that out this idea about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

balance to and ask our panelists

150
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:05,649
starting with Chris that's all right

151
00:07:03,119 --> 00:07:07,689
about your<font color="#E5E5E5"> experience is the work that</font>

152
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,729
you're doing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you kind of address</font>

153
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:15,059
this balance<font color="#CCCCCC"> between technology and</font>

154
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:15,058
policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and where you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> best sits</font>

155
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:23,360
thanks Tim I'm Australia so I I do open

156
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:25,400
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and posted that three and a half</font>

157
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,520
years working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tim that free press</font>

158
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:30,620
and that did a tour through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state so</font>

159
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:35,599
I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen a few different science of</font>

160
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:38,660
this this theory<font color="#CCCCCC"> of change for for</font>

161
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,510
activism and I mean I use slightly

162
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,430
different words that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do I wouldn't I</font>

163
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,810
I don't think really in terms of

164
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:47,270
dissidents I think that's an accurate

165
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:48,230
term it's just not how I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it but</font>

166
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:51,020
I think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it a lot of terms of</font>

167
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:53,060
underdogs right this to me when you're

168
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:54,560
talking about the FCC and I come try to

169
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:56,330
get a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> public interest out from there</font>

170
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,280
what you're talking about the occupied

171
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,409
with them and you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those</font>

172
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us on on the side that everyone in</font>

00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,220
this conference is auto surveillance of

174
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,919
Homeland Security you are talking about

175
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:09,080
people who are facing long odds in

176
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:15,919
advancing the change that they want and

177
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:17,870
so it has to be for me a an old from an

178
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,349
all fronts challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and all fronts</font>

campaign and offensive salt of other

180
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:27,110
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can do with technology to</font>

181
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:30,169
advance our vision for part of things we

182
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">can do with policy advocacy and legal</font>

183
00:08:30,169 --> 00:08:34,098
change at activism to advance audition

184
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:38,729
floral then I would have a third<font color="#E5E5E5"> front</font>

187
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:46,500
for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean my reflection back on the</font>

00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:49,199
other side of it was it was really great

189

really great Phil an amazing community

192
00:08:55,780 --> 00:09:02,829
others may disagree and there were some

193
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,060
interesting technology things to be done

194
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:05,710
once a little bit not germane to that

195
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:07,719

about this a lot from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the surveillance</font>

was the interplay between technology and

from the viewpoint that policy is

00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:41,090
permission which is to say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

don't have a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dissent it's very</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">easy to have open policies or when you</font>

244
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:12,790
moved their policies away from

<font color="#E5E5E5">dissent and towards rules and mechanisms</font>

248
00:11:18,579 --> 00:11:23,679
that require identity registration that

249

filter the web in stronger more

250
00:11:23,679 --> 00:11:30,549
nefarious ways and so policy turns out

<font color="#E5E5E5">to be really unreliable all the places</font>

00:11:30,549 --> 00:11:37,679
where where we have strong traditions of

free speech even in those places

254
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:43,629
throughout history whenever that society

has felt threatened and things have been

dicing that people I felt like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

couldn't trust their neighbors those

either weren't enforced where they were

260
00:11:51,790 --> 00:11:56,829

<font color="#E5E5E5">exceptions in times of emergency were</font>

made and then extended over and over

263
00:11:59,079 --> 00:12:06,609
again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I regard policy is somewhat</font>

264
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,499
difficult to trust technology on the

265
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:10,239
other hand because it is a thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> you put</font>

266
00:12:08,499 --> 00:12:11,619
in a place in environment and did follow

267
00:12:10,239 --> 00:12:13,660
the rules and visa they're going to work

270
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:22,238
going on around it but of course all

271
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:25,269
technologies is deployed in a space that

272
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:28,119
is shaped<font color="#E5E5E5"> by policy and all the policy</font>

273
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,730
is a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of rules about technology</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's a huge interplay between the</font>

forces<font color="#CCCCCC"> policymakers to to make hard</font>

288
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:06,939
choices and are my hope is that we can

00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:09,500
use technology to push policymakers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

that's how a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff turns</font>

policy is a terrible tool for

00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,138
know if government cites the policy gets

359
00:16:03,919 --> 00:16:10,129
in the way policy suddenly isn't there

360
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:11,749
anymore so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you ever try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:14,089
lose policy to constrain government it

specific narrow areas free speech has a

364
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,889
reasonably because we have such a strict

reasonably good history of being an

368
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:31,988
a case anywhere in the world through

369
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:34,189
history as far as I can tell where

370
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:35,839
policy has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been infected to look</font>

371
00:16:34,189 --> 00:16:37,819
constraining international surveillance

372
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,799
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work like that you know</font>

373
00:16:37,819 --> 00:16:41,299
that's that's purely a power game

374
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:43,220
everyone knows as much as they can do

375
00:16:41,299 --> 00:16:45,230
based on the money that they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

376
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:48,649
you know what their weather geopolitical

377
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:51,589
goals are so I would never try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use</font>

378
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:54,410
use policy there however technology is

379
00:16:51,589 --> 00:16:56,839
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective in constraining a lot of</font>

380
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,980
the negative impacts of governance

00:16:56,839 --> 00:17:00,619
structures of government and

382
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:02,869
surveillance so and that technology

383
00:17:00,619 --> 00:17:04,220
comes from the commercial sector where

384
00:17:02,869 --> 00:17:06,319
the government has ordered the

385
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,970
commercial and /<font color="#E5E5E5"> open-source sector</font>

386
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,309
where the government has much less

387
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:14,149
impact so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have this really</font>

388
00:17:10,309 --> 00:17:16,220
nice checks you know process analysis

389
00:17:14,148 --> 00:17:18,469
where I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually play these</font>

390
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:20,870
two off of<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other very nicely if</font>

00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:23,329
we're strategic about which problems we

try to solve this with policy and which

problems we try to solve with

394

much less corrupt FCC if those tools are

keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them or neutrality similarly we</font>

399
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,520
need a tech industry that has teeth if

00:17:40,169 --> 00:17:43,520
we want to stop dragnet surveillance

401
00:17:44,179 --> 00:17:49,080
you're flowing into all other things

00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:06,350
at lunch to say that they're good people

there in a complicated environment and

409
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:10,370
they could use all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us repeatedly</font>

going and telling them what we think

never hurts sure he<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help you with it</font>

412
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,470
but know what I really wanted to say was

413
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,120
them I think we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about as well</font>

414
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,360
about the conflation of these two two

415
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:25,100
things have the policy check out and the

00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:27,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">longer completion comes from the role of</font>

should I definitely not saying but we

can and so that's where the policy

detective I it's really complicated and

431
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,350
it's to me where that the one thing I

and service providers like your utility

00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,980
take credentials from your bank and go

468
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,120
use it at the government or how

469
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:44,460
different commercial entities can ask

470
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:45,959
you for your digital identity online and

471
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,580
it's within something<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the</font>

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:51,689
in cyberspace and I'm sort of freaked

474
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:54,720
out because there's almost no civil

something called<font color="#E5E5E5"> address framework and</font>

480
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:10,680
you know who is tracking this stuff

481
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,690
around trust frameworks and the

482
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:15,510
implications for digital identity online

483
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:23,340
and our rights because it's really

following their internal privacy and

security operations into a sort of the

Trust's initiative there's a handful

companies out here that have trust

499
00:21:57,930 --> 00:22:02,340
officers I think it's a parallel process

500
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:03,870
I don't think it's necessarily as well

as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great it as I'm sure many of us</font>

about a framework you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it at</font>

the abstract level it takes a couple

and start start building some things but

people are recognizing the need to

aggressively protect privacy free speech

535
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:36,540
especially in the internet space and

536
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:39,449
that's a recognition within this

conference but do we feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like there is</font>

issues like privacy on issues like net

neutrality and just like copyright

543
00:23:52,410 --> 00:23:56,460
issues like open access well really

<font color="#E5E5E5">quickly I don't know if you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

545
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:00,210
complete these just because some of the

546
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,890
early surveys that have done very

547
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,570
different results for each of those

548
00:24:01,890 --> 00:24:05,190
different issue so unfortunately I think

00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:06,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're close to that amount of it I don't</font>

I definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we're there yet</font>

551
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:10,620
there's a healthy percentage of people

552
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,810
are most surveys that still are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:03,960
here which i think is maybe I thing that

576
00:25:00,509 --> 00:25:05,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">we get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a little bit off but you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">know there are there are active</font>

578
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:11,309
processes working to change cultural

579
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:14,039
opinions around a lot of issues that

580
00:25:11,309 --> 00:25:16,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">people think have you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know national</font>

581
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:21,539
security importance there was actually a

582
00:25:16,229 --> 00:25:24,840
moment when was it 2011 I think they

583
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:27,119
both<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed the name of and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legalized</font>

584
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:30,330
things to what used to be called side of

585
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:33,178
domestic populations and it would be

586
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:36,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to see what kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

587
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:38,309
work is being done<font color="#CCCCCC"> to intentionally try</font>

588
00:25:36,359 --> 00:25:41,158
and shape community opinion there and

589
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:42,779
cultural opinion and I think that there

590
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:46,169
are probably things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font>

591
00:25:42,779 --> 00:25:49,440
community can also do a lot to try and

592
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:51,359
organize our own you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know work at the</font>

593
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:55,859
cultural level you know we spend a lot

594
00:25:51,359 --> 00:25:59,639
of time in civil society engaged with

595
00:25:55,859 --> 00:26:01,559
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the policy world we don't spend</font>

596
00:25:59,639 --> 00:26:03,869

different games that can be played there

601
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,830
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it would be really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting</font>

602
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:21,190
for this community to start engaging<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

603
00:26:14,830 --> 00:26:23,050
more oppositional culture work so you

604
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:26,590
know the question of where public

605
00:26:23,050 --> 00:26:28,659
opinion<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that is interesting I think</font>

606
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:32,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">another interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aspect to that is</font>

607
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:33,910
how how far will public opinion have to

608
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:37,540
go to really make a difference when it

609
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:39,190
comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook friends you know if</font>

government surveillance government's

612
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:47,770
answer is to not tell people about the

613
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:49,480
surveillance so we can we can have fear

614

about it if it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> concerned about it</font>

subject to laws of capital and that's

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we can actually do if you</font>

also didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have any money but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> defunding</font>

632

00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:38,500
and defunding actually does<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

634
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:40,889
useful things for us as a civil society

635
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:43,050
because defending forces them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus</font>

636
00:27:40,890 --> 00:27:45,150
or mission they don't get to do all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">all of the other stuff they have to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">they should be doing anyway for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

641
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:54,540
part and in particular that means a lot

642
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,700
less dragnet surveillance because

643
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:00,720
dragnet surveillance doesn't work you

644
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:02,970
know it's expensive sometimes you happen

to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> something but the targeted</font>

impact I wanted ads that because it's a

659
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,550
great point we in the United States

660

incredible long-term results of that

<font color="#E5E5E5">are in so in some ways I'm actually</font>

717
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:09,570
fairly pessimistic about culture driving

718
00:31:07,390 --> 00:31:12,010
those kinds of behavioral changes

719
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:14,169
separate from the technological

720
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:17,020
ecosystem I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to a certain</font>

721
00:31:14,170 --> 00:31:18,760
degree people's<font color="#CCCCCC"> behavior online is so</font>

722
00:31:17,020 --> 00:31:21,190
much shaped by the set of tools that

723
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:22,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">they have available</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the affordances</font>

724
00:31:21,190 --> 00:31:23,470
of those tools and the way they

725
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,040
encourage them to interact with

726
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:30,040
ecosystems with software systems and

727
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:34,570
information ecosystems and I think that

728
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:36,820
we see people adopting platforms and

729
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,260
protocols because those are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

730
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:43,179
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cool those are where their</font>

731
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:46,540
friends are much more so than thinking I

732
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:49,180
want to be specifically secure I'm going

733
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:50,980
to specifically change the way i use the

734
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:53,650
existing tools that I've have available

735
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:56,970
to me they may change their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own behavior</font>

736
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:59,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">around for instance what they say online</font>

737
00:31:56,970 --> 00:32:01,120
that's what a social level though

738
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:04,600
instead of a technical behavior online

739
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,310
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that one of the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

740
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:08,860
biggest things that we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see to</font>

741
00:32:06,310 --> 00:32:12,879
see significant adoption of encryption

tools is to win startup founders over to

743
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,389
win too

744
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:21,080
the development culture that begins

those projects the culture<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the the</font>

communities where the tools are coming

747
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:26,928
out oh so that you get tools that have

748
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:29,239
that focus you get tools that drag

749
00:32:26,929 --> 00:32:30,919
people in the direction and not non the

750
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:33,889
tools from this Community I'm not

757
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:50,659
has far more of an impact on on

messaging security globally then<font color="#CCCCCC"> OTRS</font>

have you know you know for all that

760
00:32:53,299 --> 00:32:57,440
we've all of this community spent so

761
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,418
much time concentrating on some of these

762
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:03,739
higher security tools you have to go

763
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:06,559
with the users are if you want to

764
00:33:03,739 --> 00:33:12,080
actually change the security footprint

765
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:14,389
of mass populations so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

766
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:21,080
can get security for all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people all</font>

767
00:33:14,389 --> 00:33:23,019
the time I hope we get security for the

768
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:27,039
people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> need it when they needed</font>

769

whether we wanted what<font color="#E5E5E5"> they wanted and</font>

770
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:33,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay with the notion</font>

771
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:36,840
that's not even significantly everybody

772
00:33:33,350 --> 00:33:38,699
in order to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that class of user who</font>

of the chat when they want to be then

any different from the insecure chat

application that they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> using last</font>

week that's what people start using

00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:55,830
stuff that's that's how you drive

804
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:57,509
adoption and then you need to get those

805
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:59,460
people using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and they start using it</font>

806
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:02,640
for secure step and then they start

807
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,750
using it for random communication with

808
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,359
the other people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're already</font>

811
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:12,359
adoption looks like it fine corner of

812
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:14,330
the world where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at you know if</font>

813
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:16,850
you have a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

people connecting through your platform

815
00:35:16,850 --> 00:35:20,150
in a month that's pretty good right

816
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:22,100
that's that looks like something that's

817
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:24,710
actually usable but people are using<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

819
00:35:24,710 --> 00:35:28,670
for things that don't and once you start

00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:30,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">building up that you've got an adoption</font>

one of the barriers to actually do

<font color="#E5E5E5">I have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to contrary thoughts on this one</font>

826
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:48,319
is I have been very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> a very little</font>

827
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,470
one said but I think there's a smaller

828
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,520
set of choices or a smaller set of

829
00:35:50,470 --> 00:35:53,870
constraints and environment in which

830
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:56,180
this really does make a difference in

831
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:58,549
the biggest<font color="#E5E5E5"> state-appointed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is dis</font>

832
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,100
generally where fire department has a

833
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:02,900
much better share<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the lower browser</font>

834
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,000
market that it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> other countries</font>

835
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:06,890
and one of the major reasons that's

836
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">usually pointed to for this is the fire</font>

837
00:36:06,890 --> 00:36:12,379
boxes open source and consider to be

838
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:14,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">more respective of privacy of its</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users</font>

839
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:17,240
than how their web browser manufacturers

840
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:20,000
and I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that to be true not merely</font>

841
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:21,350
the students prohibition that's a

<font color="#E5E5E5">different kind of thing right we're</font>

very constrained environment before a

the best hope we have of getting you

know I healthy not completely but a

healthy degree of security for the

down I<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel so real general we get some</font>

optimistic ideas about the future

sort of a mixed em mixed response to

that which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is also a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

880
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:06,290
it's um we talked about the technology

881
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:07,610
and obviously do this new technology you

882

know<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost money and we talked a little</font>

00:38:07,610 --> 00:38:12,230

901
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:01,279
very optimistic that they're thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

anything about the money that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

904
00:39:03,290 --> 00:39:07,490
may give you some optimism but I also

905
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:10,040
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue of the State Department</font>

906
00:39:07,490 --> 00:39:12,819
it when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> the State Department</font>

907
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:15,569
Congress's involvement government simple

908
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:17,940
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to creating technology</font>

909
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:20,779
you said make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> around things that</font>

910
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:24,709
other aspects<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the Savior</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

911
00:39:20,779 --> 00:39:28,650
control is an interesting problem

912
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:31,529
wondering Chris since<font color="#E5E5E5"> you seem to work</font>

913
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,979
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> many sides of that issue what do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

914
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:37,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about them yeah I was at the State</font>

916
00:39:37,259 --> 00:39:42,749
part of this aportfolio it's it's work

917
00:39:40,890 --> 00:39:43,799
that has a tremendous footprint and that

918
00:39:42,749 --> 00:39:45,328
was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> another comment that I</font>

919
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,859
forgot to make earlier about funding out

920
00:39:45,329 --> 00:39:48,119
there is this nice full body that's

921
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:50,069
going to support these things out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

922
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:52,199
two orders of magnitude up from the

923
00:39:50,069 --> 00:39:55,019
funding that's on the other side so

924
00:39:52,199 --> 00:40:02,819
funny matters is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I felt you were 20</font>

925
00:39:55,019 --> 00:40:04,229
to 40 Spurs<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's I think it's</font>

926
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:05,880
reason to be optimistic now and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

927
00:40:04,229 --> 00:40:09,718
the main<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason that I would we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it</font>

928
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,430
optimistic is to pair it with what Ellen

929
00:40:09,719 --> 00:40:13,589
and technologies in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the space of men</font>

930
00:40:11,430 --> 00:40:18,328
join in the past<font color="#CCCCCC"> decade which is I think</font>

931
00:40:13,589 --> 00:40:19,979
totally totally transforming both of

932
00:40:18,329 --> 00:40:21,959
these tools themselves and how effective

933
00:40:19,979 --> 00:40:23,788
<font color="#E5E5E5">they are that means strong security</font>

934
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:27,058
tools and how use of what they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are and</font>

935
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:29,279
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much they are able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be used by</font>

936
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:31,049
real people when they want to as James

937
00:40:29,279 --> 00:40:33,269
puts it still not for everybody forever

938
00:40:31,049 --> 00:40:36,119
to use but people who want to can now

939
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:37,950
download the<font color="#CCCCCC"> tor browser bundle and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

940
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,010
can go to the website you down

941
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:43,439
click on it and works at ten years ago

942
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:45,540
like there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was nothing anywhere vaguely</font>

943
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:47,579
like that so I'm optimistic about the

00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">Torah I'm optimistic about the growth of</font>

00:40:47,579 --> 00:40:50,400

947
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,839
and I although<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> minority of</font>

948
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:00,349
optimistic rubber or do it all seemed

949
00:40:54,839 --> 00:41:05,549
lost on so I'm an all-around<font color="#CCCCCC"> artist so</font>

950
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:09,570
the brief history of the network is one

951
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:14,160
of increasing hostility a decrease in

952
00:41:09,570 --> 00:41:17,310
room for free and we are just recently

953
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:24,328
getting serious about protecting users

954
00:41:17,310 --> 00:41:26,940
in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> hostel the trend of governance</font>

955
00:41:24,329 --> 00:41:29,190
ramping up both legal authority and

technical capability to censor<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

surveil is not going to change the

958
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:39,329
availability of technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> to help</font>

959
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,770
people in those in those systems still

operate how<font color="#E5E5E5"> their free communication</font>

stuff or anything

963
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:51,079
so far we've been effective in certain

964
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,530
places he learned a lot we're building

965
00:41:51,079 --> 00:41:57,650
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a community in the last few</font>

966
00:41:54,530 --> 00:42:00,140

the sophistication of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> kinds of</font>

software being made the skill sets of

969
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:09,260
the people are making that spot where

970
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,819
the professionalism of this niche people

971
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:14,300
working together the amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

972

ways to protect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and building</font>

974
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,410
technology to do that everything is

975
00:42:20,300 --> 00:42:27,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting better and we are not done if</font>

976
00:42:24,410 --> 00:42:29,598
proving the infrastructure for<font color="#CCCCCC"> making</font>

977
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,328
them better so I'm optimistic about what

978
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:34,490
we can do but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I realistic about the fact</font>

979
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:38,180
that the threat on the other side is

980
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:42,049
also continuing to grow and there will

981
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:45,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">come a time in the future when the</font>

00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:47,000
capability of people with entire network

perspectives and ability to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> real-time</font>

984
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,670

985
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:54,799
current work obsolete<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we need to</font>

00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:56,990
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that future as well so</font>

987
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,810
yes there's a lot of threats there's a

988
00:42:56,990 --> 00:43:02,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of pitfalls along the way but I am</font>

989
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:05,240
definitely optimistic about being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font>

990
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:07,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">to continue to carve out space for free</font>

993
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:17,990
worst places so I have I have a gun

994
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:21,190
point of optimism I'm optimistic that

995

<font color="#E5E5E5">our friends of the policy world can</font>

effectively make sure that no one<font color="#E5E5E5"> does</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">anything that's just where I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

bar of what we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out of</font>

999
00:43:28,130 --> 00:43:33,829
policies is that we can we can stop

1000
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:37,099
things from getting any worse on the

1001
00:43:33,829 --> 00:43:38,089
policy side well known i think that i

1002
00:43:37,099 --> 00:43:40,099
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually great because</font>

1003
00:43:38,089 --> 00:43:41,000
that's basically what we what we really

1004
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:43,340
need there is to know

1005
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:45,500
have to fight<font color="#CCCCCC"> any more than uphill</font>

1006
00:43:43,340 --> 00:43:47,570
battle if we get any actual wins they're

1007
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,760
like wonderful in one I'm happy about

1008
00:43:47,570 --> 00:43:51,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I'm optimistic that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if we can</font>

1009
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">keep the policy space from shifting any</font>

1010
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:57,620
further which I think we can do we can

1011
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,880
win them on those terms there are two

1012
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:00,560
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that make me fairly</font>

1013
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,960
optimistic about the future of a lot of

1014
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:07,250
this stuff one is that to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1015
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's actually pretty old and I don't</font>

1016
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:11,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the history of the internet is</font>

1017
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,570
actually just declining freedom the past

1018
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:16,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">10 years of the internet are that but</font>

1019
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:21,500
the Internet has a much older prehistory

1020
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:26,840
back when I used it and if you go talk

1021
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:28,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the old guys did that as I work they</font>

1022
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:31,910
had some fairly specific sets of

1023
00:44:28,670 --> 00:44:33,110
politics that they designed in Montana

1024
00:44:31,910 --> 00:44:34,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed with in mind when they were</font>

1025
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:37,700
building all those very early protocols

1026
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:39,140
and if you look at what the stuff that

1027
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:41,990
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> designing the time means</font>

1028
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:44,690
politically now<font color="#CCCCCC"> those politics have bred</font>

1029
00:44:41,990 --> 00:44:47,859
pretty true and this tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that we</font>

1030
00:44:44,690 --> 00:44:51,980
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> over over 40 or 50 year period</font>

1031
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:53,750
design political ideas into technology

1032
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,860
and have them actually have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> impact</font>

1033
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:57,710
on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world that we thought they would</font>

1034
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:59,690
now the reason the internet doesn't mean

1035
00:44:57,710 --> 00:45:00,890
exactly what those guys thought it would

1036
00:44:59,690 --> 00:45:03,020
mean when they need a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> design</font>

1037
00:45:00,890 --> 00:45:04,819
work is because we've added more layers

1038
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,270
and because things have shifted in

1039
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:09,680
context but from the bits of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1040
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:12,140
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> still mean pretty much what they</font>

1041
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:15,529
thought they did and those old guys now

1042
00:45:12,140 --> 00:45:16,970
by the way incredibly furious and this

1043
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,720
is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the other things that makes me</font>

1044
00:45:16,970 --> 00:45:22,580
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> hopeful is you know the IETF is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that the IETF this does not come</font>

optimism is that consumer technology

doesn't really matter in some ways the

1065
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:25,940
and technology integration and

1066
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:28,580

conclusively that<font color="#CCCCCC"> usg does engage in</font>

countries who are terrified and furious

1071
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:41,060
about this this is doing some fairly

1072
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:43,940
nasty things and we'll be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

increasingly nasty things<font color="#CCCCCC"> to us tech</font>

1148
00:50:31,349 --> 00:50:36,910
organizing around these issues I mean

1149
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:39,810
take note<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10 years</font>

1150
00:50:36,910 --> 00:50:42,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">gossip in a period very effective</font>
