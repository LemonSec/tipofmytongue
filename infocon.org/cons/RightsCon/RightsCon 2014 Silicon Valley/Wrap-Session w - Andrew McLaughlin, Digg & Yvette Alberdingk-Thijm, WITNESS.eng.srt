<font color="#E5E5E5">of the day what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we thought we would do</font>

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,770
to wrap the day up is reflect for a few

18
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,879
minutes on what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> changed from the last</font>

19

<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we did right Scott so two years ago</font>

20
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,870
roughly speaking we were here in this

21
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,640
facility doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first version of the</font>

conference and a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things are</font>

24
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,399
different two years later and we also

25
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,439
thought maybe we would project forward

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,100
two years from now and talk about what

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,649
we'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see so um so we vet what</font>

28
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:20,479
strikes you that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different in 2014</font>

29
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:23,250
compared to<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years ago so Andrew I</font>

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,408
asked one person was what's really

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,970
different this year and they said a lot

32
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:29,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> action is happening in the</font>

33
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:30,840
hallways particularly those people

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,548
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual room so</font>

35
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,680
maybe a little bit of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

36
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,509
reflected right now I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of the</font>

37
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,710
things that's different is that it used

38
00:01:36,509 --> 00:01:42,210
to be the Silicon Valley the human

<font color="#E5E5E5">rights conference the Silicon Valley</font>

40
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:46,649
human rights conference and it became

41
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">right scone I think that's actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

42
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:53,009
very very symbolic for the fact that

43
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:55,470
people it's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights based we moved</font>

44
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:58,409
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the abstract into talking about</font>

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,869
real life situations how are specific

46
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,270
technology decisions affecting people

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:04,710
daily who are trying to effect change I

48
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,119
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a different conversation so</font>

49
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:08,038
I would agree with that i would say i

50
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,288
would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that one phrase you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just don't</font>

51
00:02:08,038 --> 00:02:12,420
hear this year is internet freedom so

52
00:02:10,288 --> 00:02:13,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know two</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in 2012 that was</font>

53
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,820
the focus of the conference

54
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,710
turn around<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet freedom</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as a sort</font>

55

of abstract notion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of free flows of</font>

00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:21,140
information absence of censorship and

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,730
now we're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much talking about</font>

58
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,500
individual rights and threats to

59
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:27,570
individuals the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that companies can</font>

60
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,780
play in either contributing to or

61
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:31,920
resisting those threats and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nature</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of the technologies that you can use to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">protect yourself</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a very different</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation broadly speaking two years</font>

65
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago we were very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on censorship</font>

66
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,709
censorship was viewed as<font color="#CCCCCC"> the core threat</font>

two years<font color="#CCCCCC"> later now particularly post</font>

all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these dumps of documents and all</font>

69

of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> accompanying revelations about</font>

surveillance activities by democratic

00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,299

core issue the core cluster the core set

of threats and broadly speaking I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

75
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:06,780
we've moved from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a much more simplistic</font>

76
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:09,510
narrative about good guys and bad guys

77
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:13,560
you know last time around<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were</font>

78
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:16,769
talking about the Green Revolution in

79
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:18,690
Iran we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the Great</font>

80
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:22,320
Firewall in China we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

81
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:24,900
those kinds of broad and essentially

82
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:26,400
indefensible systems of censorship now

83
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,680
we're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a much more complex</font>

84
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,980
narrative about a fight for the health

85
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:33,870
of a complex ecosystem where democratic

86
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,959
governments do good and evil where they

87
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:39,000
both contribute to the development of

88
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,500
the internet as as<font color="#E5E5E5"> many of our</font>

89
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:43,110
governments have and at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time</font>

90
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:45,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">work actively to undermine the security</font>

91
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:48,150
protections that we have believed we

92
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:49,380
could rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very</font>

93
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting change</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I think it's</font>

94
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:54,209
quite significant is very palpable to me

95
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,040
anyway<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I believe that with that</font>

96
00:03:54,209 --> 00:03:58,500
comes the realization that there are

97
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,989
many actors and what's been I think very

98
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,160
encouraging in this today that we would

99
00:04:00,989 --> 00:04:05,579
hope everybody would continue to

100
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:07,920
tomorrow is the direct<font color="#E5E5E5"> and open feisty</font>

101
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:09,959
as I've noticed conversations between

102
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,899
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different actors in the space and</font>

103
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,910
for me as a human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights activist it's</font>

104
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:18,600
really important to understand and to

105
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen when and somebody who's</font>

106
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,650
may be directly affected by<font color="#CCCCCC"> a policy</font>

107
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:24,420
that one of the big technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies</font>

108
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,390
actually has put in<font color="#CCCCCC"> place can have</font>

109
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:29,820
that immediate conversation so I think

110
00:04:26,390 --> 00:04:31,560
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a huge opportunity we have here I</font>

111
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,050
would say to the government's and the

112
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,610
technology companies and to some of the

113
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:38,400
funders when is the last time you

114
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:42,480
actually had a direct conversation with

115
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,929
someone whose rights are directly

116
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,460
affected by technologies or by

117
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:49,680
repressive regimes and you were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

118
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:51,450
actually do it right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the right</font>

119
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,400
school and so that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great thing to do</font>

120
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:55,650
yes sir from<font color="#E5E5E5"> two years ago the question</font>

121
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,479
was who are you and now two years later

122
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,320
it's what are we doing together what can

123
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:02,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">we do together I think it's also</font>

124
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:04,349
struggling at two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago we were we</font>

125
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">really struggled to try to get companies</font>

126
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:07,710
to show up and we spent a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of time</font>

127
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,150
basically like lobbying people that we

128
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,710
knew at tech companies to actually show

129
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,020
up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this time around two years later</font>

130
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:15,539
you can see I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think 18 companies are</font>

131
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:18,659
doing transparency reports which is a

132
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:20,130
huge shift we see people picking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

133
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:22,770
phone and calling and saying like can<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

134
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:24,870
get on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a panel which which i think is</font>

135
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:26,940
need um and you know wonder if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> could</font>

136
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:30,330
make one sort of opinionated ideological

137
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:32,250
sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> appeal um one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

138
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:35,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think is so palpable this year is that</font>

139
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">fair to two years ago when the general</font>

140
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:40,190
rhetoric of this conference was you know

141
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,960
internet is good internet brings freedom

142
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,550
internet makes people you know better

143
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,120
connected and better able to realize

144

their potential etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> now we see internet</font>

145
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,190
alone can actually screw you if you

146
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:55,740
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you're doing and if</font>

147
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:57,000
you're not careful and this is a think a

148
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:00,540
really important note<font color="#E5E5E5"> to people in the</font>

our funders because one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

151
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:07,110
that strikes me is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that large</font>

152
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,210
foundations and corporations that are

153
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:13,020
providing funding to well-meaning

154
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:15,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations very often just provide</font>

155
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,979
cash or access to technology and they

156
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't really do anything to help those</font>

157
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,960
groups and those organizations protect

158
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,720
themselves<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you very often see a</font>

159
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:27,810
dynamic we're like let's say like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

Bangladesh will find itself with new

00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:36,150
funding access to new technology bunch

164
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,460
of new laptops some smartphones they

165
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:41,090
start to use them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

166
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:43,460
out any training education or assistance

167
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,448
at reducing their risks understanding

168
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:46,400
the threats and protecting themselves

169
00:06:44,449 --> 00:06:47,389
they're actually worse off with the

170
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,530
technology than they would have been

171
00:06:47,389 --> 00:06:50,300
otherwise because they're so easily

172
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,710
betraying the content of their

173
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:53,900
communications the nature of their

networks the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're the</font>

identities of people there in contact

176
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,090
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so a footnote point one of the</font>

177
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,849
implications<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think of this year's</font>

178
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:04,340
conversations is that it's basically

179
00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:06,080
foundational malpractice to be funding

180
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,989
organizations without<font color="#E5E5E5"> also helping them</font>

181
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,990
to secure themselves online and footnote

182
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:15,169
so two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> from now what would you</font>

183
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:18,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to see what do you think would be a</font>

184
00:07:15,169 --> 00:07:20,900
good rights con<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I think what would be</font>

a great rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> cone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is if the</font>

186
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,650
conversations that have happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font>

187
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:28,789
today and will happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the next two</font>

188
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:31,489
<font color="#CCCCCC">days actually led to keep action points</font>

189
00:07:28,789 --> 00:07:34,550
and partnerships that have changed moved

190
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:37,220
the needle on in terms of<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

191
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:38,599
terms of internet freedoms yeah I guess

192
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,580
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> should yes now I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

193
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:43,570
look back<font color="#CCCCCC"> and see all of the ways in</font>

194
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,770
which the<font color="#CCCCCC"> various actors that are here</font>

195
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:49,009
collaborated very tactically on the

196
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:51,409
ground to produce a greater awareness of

197
00:07:49,009 --> 00:07:54,740
security better tools for the

198
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:57,469
realization of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Rights and and so forth</font>

199
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:59,030
