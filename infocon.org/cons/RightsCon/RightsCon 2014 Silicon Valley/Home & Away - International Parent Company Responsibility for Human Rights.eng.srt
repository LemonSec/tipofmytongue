9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,860
of a Luddite in that respect but feel

chat that is the format for today's talk

13
00:00:32,189 --> 00:00:37,829
it is called human rights obligations of

14
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:40,260
home states and parent companies

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:41,850
although<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> find that the</font>

16
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:44,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation will probably be a lot more</font>

17
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,320
involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that and quite frankly</font>

18
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,879
we're happy to take it really in

19
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,790
whatever direction the group would like

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,920
to go this is intended to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font>

21
00:00:49,790 --> 00:00:55,710
informal format and so hoping to get

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,260
some good questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion from</font>

23
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:00,930
those in the road please feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> free</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

24
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,699
jump in interrupt with any thoughts or

25
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,250
questions as the conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

26
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:07,400
flowing and just imagine<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

27
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:13,850
real fire right here<font color="#CCCCCC"> in reverse</font>

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:16,650
having others there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one exception good</font>

29
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,640
great so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the goal today really</font>

30
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:22,080
would be to look at how companies who

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,620
have committed to respecting<font color="#E5E5E5"> human</font>

32
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights operate in countries that are</font>

33
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,030
challenging environments from a human

34
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,530
rights perspective and specifically

35
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:32,880
around what the engagement looks like

36
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,070
they're so engagement with the host

37
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,160
country and engagement back at the home

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:40,679
country as well and I think just for our

39
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">panelist and we'll let the Bekaa know</font>

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,820
this as well when<font color="#CCCCCC"> she arrives but I the</font>

41
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,539
focus I think of today's talking is good

42
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:50,539
to try to keep it on practical<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

43
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,540
practical

44
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">I my schedule got messed up in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some I</font>

45
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:24,440
bodies oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay well it's pretty informal</font>

46
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:28,790
so can just jump right in we're just

47
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,959
just getting underway welcome so just

48
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:31,280
saying that I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope the</font>

49
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,379
focus for today's part can be very

50
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,750
practical focused in terms of what is

51
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:38,359
what companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually doing what</font>

52
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:40,569
countries are actually doing or<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,959
doing and so we have about an hour

144
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,560
for us in

145
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,549
pressing issues when we learn to respect

146
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:30,120
human rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> office operations another</font>

147
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:31,950
challenge<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this laws are that they</font>

148
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,960
most often contain provisions of

149
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:42,740
confidentiality so now we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

150
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:47,030
major else that is cetera the loss

151
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:52,169
products to do so that's a big challenge

152
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:55,340
sometimes very fluffy so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

153
00:07:52,169 --> 00:08:01,140
bellows another big challenge is is

154
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:04,020
called heritage where we as a company

155
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:06,390
have not built the operations in these

156
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:12,150
countries from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the start we have rather</font>

157
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:19,680
acquired existing operations with their

158
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:24,510
licenses they're also from the so so the

159
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,729
challenge is that most often we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

160
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:31,659
have a one hundred percent ownership of

161
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:34,860
discomfort companies with my innocent

162
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">and cases forty-nine percent or 27</font>

163
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:44,939
and there is a governance issue how to

164
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:51,550
implement<font color="#CCCCCC"> unloaded our values which are</font>

165
00:08:44,939 --> 00:09:00,699
voices into this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can talk a little</font>

166
00:08:51,550 --> 00:09:02,849
bit more though sure sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the third</font>

167
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:06,310
challenge I want to mention is that

168
00:09:02,850 --> 00:09:12,310
whereas the point of challenge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

169
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:16,589
discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on national level we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font>

170
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:19,930
an understanding and<font color="#CCCCCC"> define ways forward</font>

171
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:23,889
that is not very much happening yet in

172
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:27,370
the locally I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> empowers in</font>

173
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:30,279
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> you meet five next steps to</font>

174
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,470
have the dialogue and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a point of</font>

175
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:38,139
challenge happening also on the ground

176
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:39,879
those will be<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenged in classy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

177
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:42,550
and even maybe just to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

178
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">more specific about what's happening so</font>

179
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:47,109
a lot of this is coming from say

180
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:49,930
requests from governments for

181
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:51,189
information for data about users or

182
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:54,399
coming in the form of surveillance

183
00:09:51,189 --> 00:09:56,800
activities or form of network<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down</font>

184
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,220
type activities yeah so in many of these

185
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:02,378
countries you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> both we know s you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">requests from prosecutors as we know it</font>

190
00:10:13,269 --> 00:10:19,560
did in our compass and besides that in

unrestricted direct access where

194
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:34,470
government has access to our systems and

195
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:40,600
our networks in a way that we are

196
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:49,060
completely without control this of

197
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:53,260
course is anything to delete the ad in

198
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:56,469
terms of what we might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen in the</font>

199
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:58,390
future on some of these issues for is

200
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:00,370
that is that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of capture</font>

201
00:10:58,390 --> 00:11:02,290
where the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> really lie I mean</font>

202
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:06,310
there are there multiple challenges but

203
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,020
you know one other that we worked a lot

204
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:11,770
of where there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> state department with</font>

205
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:14,920
job other really had to do with the

206
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:16,470
risks users in tough environments and I

207
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:20,410
think especially with mobile phones

208
00:11:16,470 --> 00:11:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">there just is a huge people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know</font>

209
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,260
the risks are under they don't

210
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:25,719
understand the extent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

211
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:27,700
governments the US government but

212
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:31,420
certainly lots of pernicious governments

213
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:34,470
are afraid of advocacy they're afraid

214
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:39,030
these secure<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments behave badly</font>

215
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:39,030
when they're confronted by people

216
00:11:40,339 --> 00:11:46,769
we looked at 70 or 80 countries in the

217
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:51,269
last five or six<font color="#CCCCCC"> years of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pass new laws</font>

00:11:46,769 --> 00:11:54,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">I relations both limiting freedom of</font>

association free speech Free Press going

220
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:59,910
after bloggers but there's also the more

00:11:57,269 --> 00:12:02,160
initiative<font color="#CCCCCC"> size which is really you know</font>

223
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,759
getting inside their phones nothing is

224
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:09,300
secure and I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

225
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,279

vulnerable they are so they<font color="#E5E5E5"> take risks</font>

227
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:16,499
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so I think that's a big subject in</font>

228
00:12:13,889 --> 00:12:18,540
both for the advocacy community for the

229
00:12:16,499 --> 00:12:21,149
philanthropic community for governments

230
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:24,899
to really try to understand that and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

00:12:21,149 --> 00:12:28,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">an experience it just said it will prob</font>

232
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:32,430
the bigger picture here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the issue</font>

233
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:34,499
responsibilities and what companies can

234
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:35,969
do I mean it the issue is that there's

235
00:12:34,499 --> 00:12:39,720
no country on earth where governments

236
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:42,930
aren't making change that arguably user

237
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,470
rights and some and when you're talking

238
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:49,430
about where the home<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company that's</font>

239
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:52,709
going out of doing business elsewhere in

240
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:54,569
regimes in markets where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> regime's</font>

241
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,949
are considered particularly impressive

242
00:12:54,569 --> 00:13:01,620
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do and I was I along with</font>

243
00:12:58,949 --> 00:13:03,359
Mike and then Patrick was was there too

244
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,120
we're involved<font color="#CCCCCC"> with setting out the</font>

245
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:08,730
global network initiative that in in

246
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,920
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways is meant to give companies</font>

247
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:14,370
diamonds on dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with these issues</font>

248
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:17,250
and that you know the fundamental

249
00:13:14,370 --> 00:13:19,960
problem is law is law ranges from bad

250
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:22,370
bleep crap right

251
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:25,220
it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that kind of scale going down</font>

252
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,830
and and you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not a</font>

253
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:30,560
lot of places we law is really great and

254
00:13:27,830 --> 00:13:32,360
and in most places even in democracies

255
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:36,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">laws getting worse in a lot of cases</font>

256
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:40,010
around speech online around intermediary

257
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:43,580
liability around what you know so

258
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:47,180
turkeys a really great example and and

259
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,950
so what is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> company to do because if a</font>

260
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,079
company is going to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

261
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:53,510
do business anywhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> laws bad they will</font>

262
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:57,500
do blog they will do business absolutely

263
00:13:53,510 --> 00:14:00,200
zero nowhere right so so it's a it's a

264
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:02,710
bad world out there a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that law</font>

265
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,590
and so what are what are the principles

266
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:08,030
to think about now in an ideal world we

267
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:10,250
would have had our principles we would

268
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:14,170
have had G and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would have had you</font>

269
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:16,130
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> rugby principles around long before</font>

270
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:18,530
telecommunications<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> company</font>

271
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:20,450
started spread out in the world so that

272
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:22,310
we would have started from a point of

273
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:24,320
due diligence before anybody started

274
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:28,550
doing business<font color="#CCCCCC"> but in that right and so</font>

275
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,290
with with G&I and lets you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I took</font>

276
00:14:28,550 --> 00:14:32,599
the case of Yahoo which was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

277
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:34,370
seminal cases of doing business in a

278
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,010
difficult environment where a company

279
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:40,190
got in trouble right<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo got in</font>

280
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:41,960
trouble because they went into China<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

00:14:40,190 --> 00:14:43,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">separate email service it didn't think</font>

282
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,170
through the consequences they didn't do

283
00:14:43,610 --> 00:14:48,080
their few diligence about what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

284
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,290
going to be to have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> email service in</font>

285
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:52,790
a regime where you are if you're running

286
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,349
an email service you're going to be

287
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,030
handing over dissident information to

288
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:57,680
the government that's just a given and

289
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:59,600
they had to thought through what those

290
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,459
implications were going to be and how

291
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,199
they were going to handle it

292
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:06,768
and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> short out case happened</font>

293
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:10,729
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> two chinese journal oyster</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> tao got</font>

295
00:15:10,730 --> 00:15:15,649
there was information leaks but proved

296
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:18,949
this and you know and that was one of

297
00:15:15,649 --> 00:15:22,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">the case for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> deformation P&I but that</font>

299
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:27,019
and the operational guidelines were that

you bow shall commit civil disobedience

301
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,050
in every market that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">business if that's not the principal</font>

303
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:36,050
right the<font color="#CCCCCC"> principle is you will do your</font>

304
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,629
due diligence before you go in and make

can if you decide to go in to mitigate

309
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:52,899
risks and you know in an ideal world you

310
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:54,949
have done this<font color="#CCCCCC"> before you got in right</font>

311
00:15:52,899 --> 00:15:58,220
and then you're also going to be

users have an opportunity to kind of be

00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,750
aware of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of surveillance that</font>

325
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,660
really wish that these principles had

been set up before we got so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far because</font>

327
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:41,750
now everybody is having a backtrack now

328
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:43,430
everybody's having say well we're

329
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:45,350
already in all these places and<font color="#CCCCCC"> in some</font>

cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> some due diligence was done but a</font>

331
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:49,850
lot of cases not not so much and

332
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,589
governments have already gotten very

333
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:55,220
accustomed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to making all kinds of</font>

00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,230
multinational companies as well as from

336
00:16:57,470 --> 00:17:03,770
domestic ones and now how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

337
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:07,579
walk it back to to end and that's that's

338
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:10,339
a real<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really difficult and</font>

00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:15,439
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly feel for Patrick for being</font>

in that position one day one thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

343
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:31,240
I think many many users do know that

344
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:31,240
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is for more soon else</font>

345
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:37,019
what happens is sometimes they don't use

346
00:17:35,609 --> 00:17:39,418
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> fault which is bad for our</font>

347
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:44,850
business so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is why sustainability</font>

348
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:48,080
perspective is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was the one way of</font>

349
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:54,408
addressing the homework situation

350
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:59,340
because those of course new requests and

351
00:17:54,409 --> 00:18:03,830
changes of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the operation of this way is</font>

352
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:07,470
that we implement a very strict

353
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:11,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">estimation procedure within the company</font>

354
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:15,720
so as we're a couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago if</font>

355
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:18,859
there was much too far mowing demand

00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:23,749
from machine the decision will be taken

357
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:28,249
lonely today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have a very strong</font>

now in this industry and frankly many

and corporate social responsibility

378
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:40,760
we've got to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what Rebecca</font>

379
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:43,700
talked about basically standards for

380
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,710
each industry real standards concrete

381
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">centers what are the what's the core</font>

382
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:49,490
business how does a company make profit

383
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:51,830
and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that area what are the human</font>

384
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,510
rights challenges and what are the end

385
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,790
what's the industry across the board

386
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:57,590
didn't do industry has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be involved in</font>

387
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,040
that discussion setting the standards

388
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:01,370
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

389
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:03,590
imposed from outside but then what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

390
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:05,570
the metrics what are the ways to

391
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:08,750
implement what are the ways to evaluate

392
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:10,970
and how do you basically then create

393
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:14,810
some notion of consumer investor

394
00:20:10,970 --> 00:20:16,730
pressure one company looking at another

395
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,740
and the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> and people outside</font>

396
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:21,500
looking in saying who's done a better

397
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:22,520
job that's I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the theory of the gni</font>

398
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,620
it's a theory some other

399
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:26,090
multi-stakeholder initiatives there are

400
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:28,489
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it there</font>

401
00:20:26,090 --> 00:20:30,260
isn't one size fits all<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think too</font>

402
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:32,180
many companies have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been in the position</font>

403
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:34,250
of saying well we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> best we</font>

404
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,770
have a nice process we have a statement

405
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:39,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">from somebody in size it says we really</font>

406
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:41,540
care no we have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start looking at real</font>

407
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:43,940
standards and metrics and that's also

408
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">what Rebecca's been doing in this space</font>

409
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:48,170
trying to really begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out how</font>

410
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,460
do you evaluate confidence again

411
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:52,280
companies need to be part of the

412
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,170
discussion but it can't just be due

413
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,000
diligence at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the day</font>

414
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:57,950
professor are you said we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the end</font>

00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,630
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning of the discussion let's</font>

416
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:01,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">get on to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the discussion</font>

417
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:02,450
creates a moral standards yeah an

418
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:04,100
interesting point in terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

419
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:06,710
evaluation because that would ideally

420
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:09,320
happen publicly would ideally be very

421
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:11,960
transparent and yet one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tensions</font>

422
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:13,370
particularly in this aspect of companies

423
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:16,400
doing business in these countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

424
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:17,929
that it seems over the past few years

00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">that have been more examples of</font>

00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:22,970
effective engagement that often occurs

427
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,280
behind the scenes or that there is a

428
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">transparency tension there right between</font>

429
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,520
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much companies can disclosed</font>

430
00:21:27,350 --> 00:21:32,810
publicly about what they're doing

431
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:35,060
potentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> restricted by the government</font>

432
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:36,980
or potentially for other reasons and yet

433
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,200
a demand from civil society or other

434
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:40,120
stakeholders or

435
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:41,620
public groups that would like to see

436
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:43,840
some insight<font color="#E5E5E5"> into what's what's going on</font>

437
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:46,600
here what's the scope of<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility</font>

438
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:49,510
look like there's some parallels in that

439
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,419
today parallels about WikiLeaks you know

440
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:55,390
like candy can you put I mean I'm sort

441
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:57,040
of drawing it hi you know kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

442
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,930
extreme parallel but you know the

443
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:01,270
argument that everything has to be out

444
00:21:58,930 --> 00:22:03,670
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> in public or you know in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

445
00:22:01,270 --> 00:22:06,670
achieve human rights do they're actually

446
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:09,310
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be some confidential processes</font>

447
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:10,900
and secrets going on and and if you get

448
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:13,950
you know what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right level of</font>

449
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:17,590
transparency to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> accountable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whereas</font>

450
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:19,660
you know is radical transparency really

451
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:22,000
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> achieve human rights or is it</font>

452
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,730
can achieve something else and and I

453
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is this is one of the</font>

454
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:30,010
bringing it back you know from my

455
00:22:26,410 --> 00:22:31,930
radical analogy to to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reality here I</font>

456
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:34,780
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is one of the dilemmas we</font>

457
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:38,070
face<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in my rankings project and G and</font>

458
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:41,139
I with a lot of human rights related

459
00:22:38,070 --> 00:22:43,210
processes in at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least in the ICT sector</font>

460
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:45,940
on free expression privacy and I imagine

461
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:48,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">on other HD to where there are some</font>

462
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:51,610
things that if you shed light on it then

463
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,770
he will kill them there are some things

464
00:22:51,610 --> 00:22:56,050
that companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

465
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:57,670
if you expose too much information about

466
00:22:56,050 --> 00:23:00,070
what they're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to protect their most</font>

467
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,900
vulnerable users then then that's going

468
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:05,950
to actually result in governments

469
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:11,290
finding ways to destroy<font color="#CCCCCC"> that effort and</font>

470
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:13,120
and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I've found or also just</font>

471
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:14,710
in terms of how companies engage with

472
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,850
stakeholders there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

473
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:20,840
stakeholder engagement if it were made

474
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:23,780
public couldn't happen and and so

475
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,970
achieving the right balance in terms of

476
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,420
being transparent<font color="#CCCCCC"> where transparency</font>

477
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:30,770
really promotes accountability or also

478
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:32,540
like I've been having a lot of

479
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:35,060
discussions with companies about how

480
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:36,290
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> detail they can they can disclose</font>

481
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:39,290
about their human rights impact

482
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:41,180
assessments which you know or their

483
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:44,990
human rights due diligence and risk

484
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:46,640
assessment processes internally and you

485
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,560
know there's a fine balance there

486
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,210
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're really kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of asking</font>

487
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,250
themselves the hard questions if they

488
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:54,560
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> out all out there in public is</font>

489
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:57,440
that actually you know so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

490
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,450
have some you want to have some level of

491
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:02,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know informing the public about what</font>

492
00:23:59,450 --> 00:24:05,150
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> but the other on the other</font>

493
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">hand you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know in order to actually do an</font>

494
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:10,220
operation in order to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an honest</font>

495
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:13,820
internal conversation you can't have

496
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:18,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">that entire conversation in public or</font>

497
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:20,120
won't happen and and so so just as with

498
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,520
the government you know if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

499
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:25,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do it not everything can be on a wiki</font>

500
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:30,980
you know similarly companies in their

501
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:33,950
efforts to achieve respect at for user

502
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:36,770
rights have to achieve the right balance

503
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:40,580
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is where novia civil</font>

504
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:43,129
society and and other stakeholders can

505
00:24:40,580 --> 00:24:45,530
really help companies you know try work

506
00:24:43,130 --> 00:24:48,500
constructively on where you get that

507
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:50,360
balance right and and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of push to</font>

508
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:52,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the extent possible but also recognize</font>

509
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:55,520
that radical transparency is probably

510
00:24:52,850 --> 00:24:57,260
not the answer in<font color="#CCCCCC"> my opinion it's not</font>

511
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:59,810
yeah I'd love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hear from some of this</font>

512
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:03,230
for the civil society focus people who

513
00:24:59,810 --> 00:25:04,269
sure go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh yeah this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> civil</font>

514
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:07,179
society not

515
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:08,889
business but I'm kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> simplifying a</font>

516
00:25:07,179 --> 00:25:11,830
little bit without difficult the problem

517
00:25:08,889 --> 00:25:15,158
is for businesses and I see some

518
00:25:11,830 --> 00:25:18,759
parallels with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the arms control um sort</font>

519
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:21,879
of debates and everything and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

520
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:24,399
you're a civic minded or socially

521
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:27,158
responsible company you know that if you

522
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:30,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't say for example sell to Iran then</font>

523
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:34,080
your competitor is going to and it seems

524
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:37,269
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> these standards</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> codes of conduct</font>

525
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:40,718
whatever unless they're universal or at

526
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:43,299
the very least laws of one domestic one

527
00:25:40,719 --> 00:25:46,719
country then it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very hard</font>

528
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:49,509
if not impossible for a company that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

529
00:25:46,719 --> 00:25:51,249
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you know seeking profit to</font>

530
00:25:49,509 --> 00:25:54,429
just restrain themselves voluntarily

531
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:56,919
from a market I mean how does that work

532
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:58,719
exactly not impossible<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could just</font>

533
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:02,889
give your name and organization Miriam

00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:09,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">Human Rights very long how exactly do we</font>

536
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:13,089
expect these companies to restrain

537
00:26:09,789 --> 00:26:17,349
themselves if there's no law or at the

538
00:26:13,089 --> 00:26:20,440
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> evening what did I go ahead just</font>

539
00:26:17,349 --> 00:26:22,059
stand around in particular you know one

540
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:26,559
of the things part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this discussion is</font>

541
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:30,700
also home country regulation and there

542
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:33,750
was a regulation an executive order<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:37,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the Obama administration the lady</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> trinity technology to Iran Syria now</font>

545
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:42,300
we can debate how well it was forced

546
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:44,580
that's a discussion of himself but I

547
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,430
think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a number of ways now</font>

548
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,980
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> underreporting side where</font>

549
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:52,500
government is beginning the US

550
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">government at least is beginning example</font>

551
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:57,960
on Burma lifting the<font color="#E5E5E5"> jada there now</font>

552
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,250
reporting requirements for every company

553
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,260
doing five hundred thousand dollars

554
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">worth of business who they're dealing</font>

555
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:07,260
with what the human rights implications

556
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:10,050
are profound extractive industries condo

557
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:12,060
but I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is probably some ways</font>

558
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:15,060
in which in some ways government's own

559
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:17,040
governments can at least create some

560
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:21,450
greater you know public<font color="#E5E5E5"> awareness is</font>

561
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:23,480
going because like after 2,000 I just

562
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:26,610
really after 2000 I agree

563
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,830
said oh so terrible nokia siemens sold

564
00:27:26,610 --> 00:27:31,770
this mobile surveillance technology to

565
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:33,210
iranian regime to this day beside don't

566
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:35,010
know how we would have<font color="#CCCCCC"> done that</font>

567
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,410
differently what kid what<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly could</font>

568
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,820
anyone have done to prevent something

569
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:41,790
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> well that's what these</font>

570
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:46,919
regulations women to do yeah two things

571
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:51,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mean it is respect but the question is</font>

572
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:53,700
some kind somehow wrong input so what I

573
00:27:51,750 --> 00:27:56,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be reviewed in my company and my</font>

574
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,560
colleagues within other telcos is to

575
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:04,050
explain business case<font color="#E5E5E5"> inspect to menards</font>

576
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:06,450
which there is no<font color="#E5E5E5"> business case if I'd</font>

577
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:08,340
only been visible that this is what

578
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:11,280
investors want this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what customers</font>

579
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:13,290
want this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone is one thing</font>

580
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:15,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national community want then it</font>

581
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:17,750
didn't happen in my company so it's a

582
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:20,850

00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,600
are we starting to see components that

628
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:30,730
said how do you be issued so the issue

629
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:34,710
of transparency is or have is there is a

630
00:30:30,730 --> 00:30:37,630
quite<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pressure in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US and some</font>

636
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:02,410
hasn't been noticed whatever so no

637
00:30:59,110 --> 00:31:06,250
questions and all the base so the debate

638
00:31:02,410 --> 00:31:09,850
is very vivid here<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat in the UK</font>

639
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:14,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">but um hands work and I'm as to</font>

00:31:14,830 --> 00:31:22,360
our cast my company's customers in

643
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:28,860
it's it's more so the mage what I will

644
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:31,570
be calling major events and and

645
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:35,080
specifically so honestly to become

646
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:38,679
access which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the main problem for the</font>

647
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:41,699
main violation of free expression so

648
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:44,830
that's where we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> shed more light</font>

649
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:49,470
work because there no one has control

650
00:31:44,830 --> 00:31:51,760
how much the government's access and

651
00:31:49,470 --> 00:31:53,680
enough for stores also networks

652
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,360
shutdowns said one thing I want to

653
00:31:53,680 --> 00:32:02,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">highlight is that in our customers in</font>

654
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:02,580
these countries are predominantly

data will come in due time or today

657
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:21,059
more voice in the debates like these

658
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:23,820
days here at right calm<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sometimes feel</font>

664
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,220
account in our discussions as well and

665
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:43,908
when we won try to be transparent on

666
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,840
these major events coming to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Edward</font>

there are these permissions of

confidentiality we're not allowed to

669
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:54,270
tell sometimes we were in one occasion

670
00:32:51,809 --> 00:32:58,649
many years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were even told to to</font>

671
00:32:54,270 --> 00:33:01,080
to tell a lie why why the<font color="#CCCCCC"> LEM focused on</font>

672
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:02,880
that of course we refused we have not

00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:12,330
published on a<font color="#CCCCCC"> homepage a short note</font>

676
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:14,789
saying that during last nine months in

approximately<font color="#E5E5E5"> 20 weeks but if we go</font>

further<font color="#E5E5E5"> than that long we will want to</font>

00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,350
go further

681
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:32,130
Michael Rebecca I need sort of other

682
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,080
examples or company<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking of that</font>

683
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:35,520
have started<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get this balance right</font>

684
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,699
or we're sort of the stakeholder

685
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:40,770
community has been understanding of the

686

company position or we both work with

687
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:47,639
the you know Yahoo Microsoft you know

and I they took a risk they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

690
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:55,290
room with NGOs with you know social

00:33:53,850 --> 00:33:58,320
investment funds<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the light and they</font>

692
00:33:55,290 --> 00:33:59,820
said let's negotiate standing and then

693
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,010
they put themselves to the faces<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

694
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">they now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sarah Lulu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

695
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:05,850
yesterday that they have now begun to

696
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:09,899
evaluate Rebecca's building in that by

697
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:11,909
doing these these mentors I think again

698
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:13,679
the telcos haven't stepped up we're

699
00:34:11,909 --> 00:34:16,140
worse<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter were there a whole bunch</font>

700
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:17,880
of other companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't dating so</font>

701
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:20,339
I think it's to the credit of those that

702
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:22,980
were the first there and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

703
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:25,770
put themselves at risk by being out

704
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:28,050
there I think it can be done it's not

705
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:30,330
only the telcos it's also<font color="#CCCCCC"> where system</font>

706
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">now there's a slew of companies that are</font>

707
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:35,940
involved in this space that ought to be

708
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,980
essentially you know judge by similar

709
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:40,440
criteria again they should help define

710
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:43,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">the territory but then let's have a real</font>

711
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:45,630
discussion metrics let's have a real you

712
00:34:43,469 --> 00:34:47,850
know you do it in the financial world no

713
00:34:45,630 --> 00:34:49,740
company thinks twice about financial

714
00:34:47,850 --> 00:34:52,440
reporting everybody holds the same

715
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:54,509
standard<font color="#CCCCCC"> that public expects it if you</font>

716
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:56,460
want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the business</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case the</font>

717
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,500
business case comes when consumers can

718
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:02,220
evaluate one company against noted by

719
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:06,030
the same standard that's green yeah I

720
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean it's very much a work in progress</font>

721
00:35:06,030 --> 00:35:10,590
right

722
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:15,300
terms of what what is the ideal level of

723
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:17,460
transparency and I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

724
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:19,590
companies that are further<font color="#E5E5E5"> along but I</font>

725
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,420
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're all kind of collectively</font>

726
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:24,930

727
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,000
and there was a session on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Monday about</font>

728
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,730
transparency reporting and standards

729

around that and even just<font color="#E5E5E5"> in terms of</font>

known as it is jean rhys it's mainly

732
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:39,750
about reporting the number of requests

733
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,430
you receive more companies are reporting

734
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,560

736
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:48,900
blocking requests and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to</font>

737
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:50,940
get companies to be equally good about

738
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,560
all the different types of requests but

739
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:58,170
but also being transparent you know kind

how high we should<font color="#E5E5E5"> always standard about</font>

on it everything the goal is the right

754
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:34,330
amount of transparency so that people

755
00:36:33,330 --> 00:36:36,970
understand how

activities and<font color="#CCCCCC"> their access to</font>

766

power is being abused they can hold it

768
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:07,450
accountable and that's that's God's I

769
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:09,550
mean you know that's you know for those

773
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:19,750
of the new technologies we're still

774
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:22,120
working out exactly with where the sweet

775
00:37:19,750 --> 00:37:23,590
spot is<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mash the companies for</font>

776
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,089

777
00:37:23,590 --> 00:37:26,440
that unless we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get governments to be</font>

778
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:28,360
more transparent about what they're

00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:32,080
demanding unless we get governments to

780
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:34,240
allow companies to move port and and you

781
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:36,009
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a broader movement to get</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">often walls they're passing that are</font>

forcing you know so there's a much

785
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:45,819
broader ecosystem that obviously needs

<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of open it up for questions we've</font>

789
00:37:49,570 --> 00:37:53,250
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> a number of kind of lines of inquiry</font>

790
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:56,770
open here but wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at</font>

791
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:58,990
companies increasing leverage in their

negotiations or discussions engaging

00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:04,359
with state good session earlier this

794
00:38:01,870 --> 00:38:06,520
morning on this obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've heard</font>

795
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:07,990
today a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot about collaboration working</font>

796
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:09,820
with industry coalition's trying to

797
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:11,379
bring companies together as a more

798
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,150
effective way to gain leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

799
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:15,910
States we've heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about some creative</font>

800
00:38:13,150 --> 00:38:18,270
legal mechanisms potentially using

801
00:38:15,910 --> 00:38:20,830
contract law or contract provisions to

802
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:22,990
gain leverage<font color="#CCCCCC"> over States what are we</font>

803
00:38:20,830 --> 00:38:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">starting to see as some of the more</font>

00:38:22,990 --> 00:38:29,200
the blaze or more creative ways to think

about about them one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

806
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,089
was very striking to me when I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

807
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:35,950
government was how often a single

808
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:38,830
company would come and say who we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

real<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem in country X</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> well you would</font>

810
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:43,750
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up and I say you know I've heard</font>

811
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,610
from three other companies if you

812
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:48,940
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> you not only are exactly talk to</font>

813
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:51,100
them it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not possible everywhere you</font>

814
00:38:48,940 --> 00:38:53,830
know there are places China would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one</font>

815
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,839
that's so big and commercially important

816
00:38:53,830 --> 00:38:57,369
that it's hard to get everybody that

817
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,130
waiting but there are places where I

818
00:38:57,369 --> 00:39:02,619
think collective pressure by companies

819
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:05,290
together you know the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

820
00:39:02,619 --> 00:39:07,270
government's say can't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

821
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:09,190
you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean if every company</font>

822
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:11,200
comes in in the same way and says no one

823
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:13,869
I can cover if there's some places where

824
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,270
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the combination of diplomatic</font>

825
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:18,630
pressure from governments and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> United</font>

826
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:22,090
industry position would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> enormously</font>

827
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:24,310
attach that to fighting allies<font color="#CCCCCC"> in civil</font>

828
00:39:22,090 --> 00:39:26,200
society and politics because you know

829
00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:28,150
China is an example where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't do</font>

830
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,040
that so much because<font color="#E5E5E5"> now as in civil</font>

831
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:32,230
societies go to jail you<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach out to</font>

832
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:33,790
them but but there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> many sides of</font>

833
00:39:32,230 --> 00:39:35,950
Turkey would be an example in

834
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:38,050
philippines or analysts with these

835
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:41,799
battles are being fought that it's where

836
00:39:38,050 --> 00:39:45,310
you get that alliance between a part of

fighting against bad internet laws is

kind of their signature thing and

00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:08,618
finding the right allies because because

00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:15,259
17 cases so far and having the company's

and businesses to behave themselves and

911
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:50,240
we know what that means thank you yes

1018
00:48:45,569 --> 00:48:49,049
the principle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought is across the</font>

board<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a parent company</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1020
00:48:49,049 --> 00:48:54,538

1021
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:56,609
committed by the subsidiary but security

1022
00:48:54,539 --> 00:48:58,319
forces hired by the subsidiary that was

1023
00:48:56,609 --> 00:49:01,078
allowed to proceed against the parent

1024
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,579
company and one of the justifications

1025
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:04,890
was that you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> look to the guiding</font>

1026
00:49:02,579 --> 00:49:07,829
principles as a standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of care so you</font>

1027
00:49:04,890 --> 00:49:10,589
could skip the<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidiary division by</font>

1028
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:12,059
applying and direct liability argument

1029
00:49:10,589 --> 00:49:14,549
to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> predominance in preliminary</font>

1030
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:16,349
stages but the principle is actually

1031
00:49:14,549 --> 00:49:18,989
pretty significant that now we have a

1032
00:49:16,349 --> 00:49:20,999
standard of care for certain companies

1033
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:23,489
no matter where they<font color="#CCCCCC"> operate and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1034
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:25,769
and there's similar case in in England

1035
00:49:23,489 --> 00:49:28,019
also the metals context monterrico

1036
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:29,609
metals that it had to do with risk

1037
00:49:28,019 --> 00:49:31,828
management systems and whether the

1038
00:49:29,609 --> 00:49:35,279
parent company put in place a great risk

1039
00:49:31,829 --> 00:49:36,749
management system so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hope and</font>

1040
00:49:35,279 --> 00:49:38,430
the in terms of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> business</font>

1041
00:49:36,749 --> 00:49:40,078
incentives that legal risks are

1042
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,058
multiplying but they<font color="#E5E5E5"> multiply not</font>

1043
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:44,069
through legislation they're multiplying

1044
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:46,200
because there's consensus around these

1045
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:50,989
of standards which then becomes

1046
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:50,989
indirectly binding through private law

1047
00:49:53,690 --> 00:50:03,750
yeah detriment I'm first of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all I'm</font>

1048

1049
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:07,320
asked but about the UN guiding

00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:10,589
principles becoming ultimately illegal

with changes to it of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking</font>

1057
00:50:23,430 --> 00:50:28,259
there is applicable internationally

1058
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:30,450
where the court<font color="#CCCCCC"> said environmental</font>

connecting the two mentions that<font color="#CCCCCC"> rocky</font>

1063
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:43,290
guiding principles therefore leads us to

1064
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:45,180
a requirement<font color="#E5E5E5"> of duty of governments to</font>

00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:47,550
protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> American all defenders</font>

1066
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,890
particularly those confronting

1067
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:51,990
governments and resource extractive

1068
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:55,140
industry businesses who are in collusion

1069

duplicity against these environmental

1070
00:50:55,140 --> 00:51:00,870
and defenders but also using the guiding

1071
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:02,520
principles which says human rights

1072
00:51:00,870 --> 00:51:04,470
defenders must be respected by

1073
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:06,360
businesses and protected<font color="#CCCCCC"> by governments</font>

1074
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:08,520
so I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> wondering</font>

1075
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:11,730
comments about that if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> had</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> copies of</font>

1076
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:14,550
the article about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> collars case in</font>

1077
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:16,830
the subsequent<font color="#CCCCCC"> case but i think the</font>

1078
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:20,010
guiding principles play<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very useful</font>

1079
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:22,680
role in putting this subject on the

1080
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:25,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">agenda</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as legitimate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> subject the guiding</font>

1081

principles for a reaction<font color="#E5E5E5"> in some ways</font>

1082
00:51:25,470 --> 00:51:30,600
to the UN norms that were proposed 15 or

1083
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,180
20 years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago which were soundly rejected</font>

1084
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:35,370
by every government the government of

1085
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:38,220
Ecuador is trying to reopen that debate

1086
00:51:35,370 --> 00:51:39,960
it's not going to succeed so and I think

1087
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:41,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">the guiding principles don't think is</font>

1088
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,980
hard the notion<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies have a</font>

1089
00:51:41,850 --> 00:51:45,630
responsibility<font color="#E5E5E5"> to respect human rights</font>

1090
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:47,820
lots of companies come to me and they

1091
00:51:45,630 --> 00:51:50,130
say that's nice what does it mean from

1092
00:51:47,820 --> 00:51:52,290
even due diligence it's a nice phrase

1093
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:55,140
we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at each industry</font>

1094
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:56,910
specific problems that how does<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

1095
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,859
industry make its money what's its core

1096
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:00,480
business what are the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

1097
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:03,000
challenges we've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish</font>

1098
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:05,520
standards that companies themselves have

1099
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:07,380
a role<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a stay in creating and then do</font>

1100
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,410
the metrics the implementation and

1101
00:52:07,380 --> 00:52:13,380
evaluation so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's not</font>

1102
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:16,080
useful to try to make more the guiding

1103
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:18,090
principles are a point in<font color="#CCCCCC"> time but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

1104
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:20,009
Professor<font color="#CCCCCC"> Roger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> said it's the end of the</font>

1105
00:52:18,090 --> 00:52:22,050
beginning of the discussion we've got to

1106
00:52:20,010 --> 00:52:24,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">now move forward with more specificity</font>

1107
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:27,570
in terms of standards implementation

1108
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:29,399
yeah my social to a friend of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ours likes</font>

1109
00:52:27,570 --> 00:52:32,790
to say the guiding principles are floor

1110
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:34,530
to ceiling um you know and but but it's

1111
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:36,210
also important point out too that there

1112
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:37,770
been a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of sets of principles</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1113
00:52:36,210 --> 00:52:39,780
were under development before the

1114
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:42,109
guiding principles came out so the GI

1115
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:45,019
principles were already quite

1116
00:52:42,109 --> 00:52:46,670
the guy came out and there are some

1117
00:52:45,019 --> 00:52:48,439
projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are saying oh you know now</font>

1118
00:52:46,670 --> 00:52:49,910
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to evaluate gnite principles</font>

1119
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:52,640
based on a ruddy it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the</font>

1120
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:54,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">gnite kind of proceeded</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and also the</font>

1121
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:57,049
guiding principles are you know we're

1122
00:52:54,859 --> 00:52:59,598
formulating more in the context of

1123
00:52:57,049 --> 00:53:01,670
extractives and labor rights where it's

1124
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:04,489
a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies not following law</font>

1125
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:06,259
rather than the logging the problem to

1126
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:08,599
begin with which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1127
00:53:06,259 --> 00:53:11,569
ICT sector and for expression of privacy

1128
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:14,799
issues and so as mike says you know that

1129
00:53:11,569 --> 00:53:18,440
the principles kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> as broad brush</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are a</font>

1130
00:53:14,799 --> 00:53:20,079
nice broad brush but until you kind of

1131
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,730
work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what they actually mean</font>

1132
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:25,789
operationally and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then and what the gaps</font>

1133
00:53:22,730 --> 00:53:27,890
are there are things there that just you

1134
00:53:25,789 --> 00:53:31,549
know for specific industries and

1135
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:32,960
specific issues don't neatly apply the

1136
00:53:31,549 --> 00:53:34,609
way or the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> or there's a whole set</font>

1137
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:37,099
of things it doesn't really address so

1138
00:53:34,609 --> 00:53:39,288
so it makes absolutely right in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of</font>

1139
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:41,599
just needing to flesh things out but

1140
00:53:39,289 --> 00:53:44,150
developing a guiding principles towards

1141
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,589
legally binding document its second

1142
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:47,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">inhabitant just that's not what they're</font>

1143
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:49,430
intended to be and you're never going to

1144
00:53:47,420 --> 00:53:51,559
legally binding means that governments

1145
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:53,749
are going to adore Stan Lee<font color="#E5E5E5"> if the</font>

1146
00:53:51,559 --> 00:53:54,160
endorses they what governments are going

on

1148
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:58,120
what are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually compelling</font>

1149
00:53:55,510 --> 00:54:00,190
companies and companies are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to say</font>

1150

each industry is very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1151
00:54:00,190 --> 00:54:03,610
for the telcos it's very different than

1152
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:05,920
extractives they're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> different than</font>

1153
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,510
somebody may be fair changes you just

1154
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:12,250
can't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that says for</font>

1155
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:14,560
everybody the same um<font color="#E5E5E5"> for my challenge</font>

1162

you can look at the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> motive of why</font>

regardless what industry their game oil

00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:48,010
companies will fight tooth and nail to

1172

minimize the obligation to minimize the

responsibility to minimize liability and

1174
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:53,950
exposure that's why they're happy to

1175
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:55,629
spend thousands of dollars to outside

1176
00:54:53,950 --> 00:54:56,919
law firms helping them defend these

1177
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:59,320
cases that they'd rather do that than

1178
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,120
actually address the issue and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1179
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:03,550
wondering how<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we be convinced that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">these standards will be setting up for</font>

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stealing from their perspective that</font>

1184
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:14,529
you know we know they want to pay as

1185
00:55:11,650 --> 00:55:17,980
little bit this is the way it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how do</font>

1186
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:20,560
you reconcile that so when I say first

1187
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:22,690
of all is I start from the premise that

1188
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:25,660
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a standard companies want to</font>

1189
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:27,820
make money but they ought<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make money</font>

1190
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:29,020
in a way that also respects me<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and</font>

1191
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:30,820
I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think those things are</font>

1192
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:32,800
inconsistent does it mean that every

1193
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">company is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be embracing of this</font>

1194
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,990
no does it<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean it's not going to be a</font>

1195
00:55:34,780 --> 00:55:37,850
fight

1196
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:41,029
she a shin over both the language of

1197
00:55:37,850 --> 00:55:42,980
what the standards are<font color="#CCCCCC"> complemented etc</font>

1198
00:55:41,030 --> 00:55:45,290
how they're evaluated whether some

1199
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:47,060
external person comes in to evaluate key

1200
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:48,920
havior know every one of those things is

1201
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:51,110
a fight but<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end of the day what's</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> alternative home governments the</font>

statement is<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to regulate laws</font>

1206
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,810
that make it harder for us companies to

1207
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:05,379
compete globally it's the same thing

<font color="#CCCCCC">with the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Swedish government the UK open</font>

1209
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,950
the course you know we can say there's a

1210
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:11,869
case in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Canada or there's a case here</font>

1211
00:56:09,950 --> 00:56:14,689
and there it's the incentive of the ice

1212
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:17,930
there has to be companies have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

brought into the discussion and push<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to be rules of the road for the way they</font>

00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:28,640
offer another opportunity to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it yeah</font>

1218
00:56:26,390 --> 00:56:30,920
and working with companies to redefine

1219
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,240
how they define success right and

1220
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:34,460
because there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> George your success</font>

1221
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:35,868
which is but you know quarterly results

1222
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:38,030
driven and then there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term</font>

1223
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:40,010
success which ends up they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> find much</font>

1224
00:56:38,030 --> 00:56:41,119
more about sustainability you know what

1225
00:56:40,010 --> 00:56:42,530
to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the release of</font>

1230
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:53,450
there's tons of companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can give</font>

1231
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:58,850
lip service and you know kind of do the

minimum but you know until a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lesson</font>

until we get to a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> world where</font>

1238
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:16,910
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> one reason i'm doing ranking is</font>

1239
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:18,980
to kind of have a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> of stick but it's</font>

1240
00:57:16,910 --> 00:57:20,190
it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i just kind of</font>

put it out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and don't you</font>

1242
00:57:20,190 --> 00:57:28,470
there's all on what the you know what

1243
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:30,780
what the incentive is to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

to be pragmatic because governments

1246
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,390
aren't going to pass the laws and really

1247
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:38,700
wish them to pass a single<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that</font>

1248
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:40,980
the advocacy community could do that

the next quarter I don't know how it is

in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your but I talked with lots of people</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">in a corporate side who say we would</font>

right but we're you know I'm out of here

1259
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:04,799
I know me my quarterly he announced it

1260
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:06,690
well the song<font color="#E5E5E5"> centers that but that</font>

1261
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:08,670
infects market but there are you going

1262
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:10,829
to rush that through regulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

00:58:08,670 --> 00:58:12,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">address that for well I'm not sure that</font>

00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's a pioneer in question i would i</font>

1265
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:15,900
would go with Gerald's point but maybe

1266
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:18,030
there's a third way and that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1267
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,700
it's been a journey chasms as we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked</font>

1268
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:22,920
to or Google about privacy and Google

1269
00:58:20,700 --> 00:58:25,109
really or<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we talked to the US</font>

1270
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:26,410
government really understated<font color="#CCCCCC"> western</font>

1271
00:58:25,109 --> 00:58:28,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a third way</font>

1272
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:29,509
I'm nothing ever being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to think</font>

1273
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the question that needs to be</font>

1274
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:33,560
asked but if it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is ok wait as this</font>

1275
00:58:31,730 --> 00:58:34,700
combination of regular I mean Laura's

1276
00:58:33,560 --> 00:58:36,170
never going to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the answer that you</font>

1277
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:38,000
can drop as many of those as you like

1278
00:58:36,170 --> 00:58:39,830
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a way around the law but</font>

1279
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:41,090
it's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> combination of if</font>

1280
00:58:39,830 --> 00:58:43,250
you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change something you've</font>

1281
00:58:41,090 --> 00:58:45,230
got to engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the stakeholders almost</font>

1282
00:58:43,250 --> 00:58:47,390
engaged and so here<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's government and</font>

1283
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:49,310
companies and<font color="#CCCCCC"> civil society workers etc</font>

1284
00:58:47,390 --> 00:58:50,810
so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just leave one out of the</font>

1285
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:53,000
equation you're never going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to change</font>

1286
00:58:50,810 --> 00:58:54,320
corporate culture by law you know that

1287
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:56,300
can influence over time but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1288
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">find another way to get round it so how</font>

1289
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:00,230
do you change companies if you don't at

1290
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,520
some point also<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage them in the</font>

1291
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:03,560
discussion now some you may have to

1292
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,970
discard it some point on the road but I

1293
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:06,470
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can start by the point of</font>

1294
00:59:04,970 --> 00:59:11,980
saying they're all out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the discussion</font>

1295
00:59:06,470 --> 00:59:15,529
because of what the emotion is yeah sure

1296
00:59:11,980 --> 00:59:16,940
slightly different questions picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

1297
00:59:15,530 --> 00:59:19,040
one that's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the standards based</font>

1298
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:20,840
approach and what governments can do to

1299
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:23,660
promote a standards-based approach

1300
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:26,090
outside of legislation or regulation in

1301
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:27,259
it and I'm curious and then watching<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

at least two set of voluntary standards

1325

and engaging with those<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments</font>

1326

there is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of stick because</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">there is this sense that</font>

1333
01:00:30,660 --> 01:00:34,259
down the road we're still seeing a lot

1334
01:00:32,460 --> 01:00:36,090
of misbehavior of our companies based

1335
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:37,290
our jurisdiction we may take further

1336
01:00:36,090 --> 01:00:39,240
action where there's legislation or

1337
01:00:37,290 --> 01:00:41,070
regulation so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did an interesting</font>

dynamic and I'm you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I know there's</font>

1339
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:44,310
a lot of work to do the to work with

1340
01:00:42,930 --> 01:00:46,020
other governments around the world to

1341
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:48,240
develop these natural action plans yeah

1342
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,100
Harrison your father the role<font color="#CCCCCC"> that well</font>

1343
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:52,350
I be interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the inductive like</font>

1344
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:54,569
the UK national actually I<font color="#CCCCCC"> haven't seen</font>

1345
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:56,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">very many others but I'm interested</font>

1346
01:00:54,570 --> 01:00:58,680
interested to see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many UK based</font>

1347
01:00:56,970 --> 01:01:01,049
companies have changed their actual

1348
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:03,600
behavior as a national action plan I

1349
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:05,970
know I mean worked on the voluntary

1350
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:08,819
principles trying to get even<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1351
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:11,730
European governments to push I tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1352
01:01:08,820 --> 01:01:14,600
get Nigeria and Libya and Brock<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1353
01:01:11,730 --> 01:01:17,160
others in and I do really illogical and

1354
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:18,750
so at the end of the day kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1355
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:20,850
national action plan<font color="#E5E5E5"> that says the</font>

1356
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:23,880
guiding principles but when push comes

1357
01:01:20,850 --> 01:01:25,589
to shove I want the Dutch in the UK to

1358
01:01:23,880 --> 01:01:28,680
be saying this actually matters to us

1359
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:31,080
too goodluck<font color="#E5E5E5"> jonathan and say better</font>

1360
01:01:28,680 --> 01:01:33,419
join us or there's some company no I

1361
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:36,270
have a lot of everybody wasn't rushing

1362
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:38,340
to help it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I won't come</font>

1363
01:01:36,270 --> 01:01:40,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">back just at a home state you need to</font>

1364
01:01:38,340 --> 01:01:42,390
really talk a whole lot out but if you

1365
01:01:40,950 --> 01:01:44,240
have a number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> companies say the US</font>

1366
01:01:42,390 --> 01:01:46,100
companies that are calling the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US</font>

1367
01:01:44,240 --> 01:01:48,560
and say hey we're having troubles in

1368
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:50,480
China we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> troubles in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> grand or</font>

1369
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,920
other countries you have diplomatic

1370
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,330
relations with them you know the right

1371
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:55,160
people to talk to in the government why

1372
01:01:53,330 --> 01:01:57,680
don't you guys get<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the phone and help</font>

1373
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:59,750
us out<font color="#CCCCCC"> here where where it is that</font>

1374
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:02,779
where's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> responsibility around there</font>

1375
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:04,790
or is that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that too idealistic I mean</font>

1376
01:02:02,780 --> 01:02:06,650
it realistically is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> role that the</font>

1377
01:02:04,790 --> 01:02:10,460
State Department for example wants to

1378
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:12,320
play or can play but obviously it

1379
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:14,360
depends on you know some places are

1380
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:16,370
easier than some places are hard but

1381
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:19,100
it's much easier and again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1382
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:22,250
sort of our mantra in dar el it's much

1383
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:24,790
easier if you have high for a industry

1384
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:27,230
competitors while saying the same thing

1385
01:02:24,790 --> 01:02:29,960
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult and it was</font>

1386
01:02:27,230 --> 01:02:33,290
surprising news actually I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> bored</font>

1387
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:34,940
and shocking how resistant companies

1388
01:02:33,290 --> 01:02:37,040
were who were complaining about the same

1389
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,660
thing to<font color="#CCCCCC"> even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pick up the phone and talk</font>

1390
01:02:37,040 --> 01:02:41,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">to each other to try to bring them in to</font>

1391
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:44,000
say let's have common strategies no they

1392
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:46,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">all had their own you know ambitions to</font>

1393
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:48,059
be there and they're so used to being

1394
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,739
competitive

1395
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:52,140
this is a place where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you should put the</font>

1396
01:02:49,739 --> 01:02:55,019
competitive juices aside and say we

1397
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:57,058
actually have a common agenda it's in

1398
01:02:55,019 --> 01:03:02,508
<font color="#E5E5E5">the means to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> competitive we don't</font>

1399
01:02:57,059 --> 01:03:02,509
like the other telcos this arena we do

1400
01:03:03,619 --> 01:03:14,609
each meeting we have corruption is to

1401
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:19,829
trust state which we need to do horse

1402
01:03:14,609 --> 01:03:22,979
but that we promised each other before

1403
01:03:19,829 --> 01:03:28,829
each not to discuss any competitive

1404
01:03:22,979 --> 01:03:30,448
issues prices it's whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could</font>

1405
01:03:28,829 --> 01:03:33,769
be competitive but because<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

1406
01:03:30,449 --> 01:03:36,380
break the law have you found a couple

1407
01:03:33,769 --> 01:03:38,698
through the industry dialogue or other

1408
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:40,769
collaboration with with other telcos say

1409
01:03:38,699 --> 01:03:43,289
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go back to the Swedish ever</font>

1410
01:03:40,769 --> 01:03:45,779
finish prepping freedom are are they in

1411
01:03:43,289 --> 01:03:49,680
fact more<font color="#E5E5E5"> willing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to lend support to</font>

1412
01:03:45,779 --> 01:03:52,229
help in some situations wonder the 90s

1413
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:55,558
<font color="#CCCCCC">who died out catechols each had good</font>

1414
01:03:52,229 --> 01:04:00,749
hands with their respective governments

1415
01:03:55,559 --> 01:04:02,789
I think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> from my experience is you</font>

1416
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:06,178
can't you can't have the government the

1417
01:04:02,789 --> 01:04:08,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">whole government promised to in the</font>

1418
01:04:06,179 --> 01:04:11,730
future health in any case

1419
01:04:08,130 --> 01:04:16,440
will emerge because it depends kinds of

1420
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:19,200
politics and stuff so what my firm

1421
01:04:16,440 --> 01:04:21,990
recommendation company would be to have

1422
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:24,600
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know point of contact a very open</font>

1423
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:29,850
mind so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if something happens you</font>

1424
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:35,850
can establish contact very sweetly and

1425
01:04:29,850 --> 01:04:37,920
and then based on that if all the nine

1426
01:04:35,850 --> 01:04:52,319
companies could do likewise with their

1427
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:54,870
own great any other questions you

1428
01:04:52,320 --> 01:04:59,340
mentioned the confidentiality clauses as

1429
01:04:54,870 --> 01:05:01,799
a blocker in oil mining contracts

1430
01:04:59,340 --> 01:05:04,860
revenue watch Institute has done a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1431
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:07,860
of research young tho those clauses

1432
01:05:04,860 --> 01:05:11,910
exist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their application they turn out</font>

1433
01:05:07,860 --> 01:05:14,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">and not actually which are not me most</font>

1434
01:05:11,910 --> 01:05:16,230
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time now I know that a country's</font>

1435
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:17,550
claims about national security you're

1436
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:18,800
going to be a lot more intense<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1437
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:21,960
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to face a lot more</font>

1438
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:24,240
repercussions if you test them provide

1439
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:27,630
early but is there is there any work

1440
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:30,029
being done on that test case of well

1441
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:32,250
theoretically we could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> national</font>

1442
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:34,740
security punishment but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's still</font>

1443
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:38,310
worth pushing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the envelope on what we</font>

1444
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:40,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">disclose about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these contractors I think</font>

1445
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:41,540
it's one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the areas to meet a lot of</font>

1446
01:05:40,710 --> 01:05:43,000
attention

1447
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:45,500
again it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Rebecca said earlier</font>

1448
01:05:43,000 --> 01:05:47,810
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't or shouldn't be</font>

1449
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:49,910
disclosed and there are some legitimate

1450
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:52,279
reasons not to disclose both on the part

1451
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:55,060
of governments and for companies kind of

1452
01:05:52,280 --> 01:05:58,270
died by the law but companies misuse

1453
01:05:55,060 --> 01:06:02,480
secrecy initial security in such

1454
01:05:58,270 --> 01:06:04,580
egregious ways and so uniformly I think

1455
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:06,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">I need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really take a hard look at</font>

1456
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:09,440
that and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find some collective</font>

1457
01:06:06,730 --> 01:06:11,060
strategies I mean one of the things I

1458
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:13,430
know when this second will gather the

1459
01:06:11,060 --> 01:06:17,299
early discussions with you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1460
01:06:13,430 --> 01:06:19,430
googles and Yahoo's it's one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1461
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:21,740
challenges initially was that you have

1462
01:06:19,430 --> 01:06:23,509
people any country as the main

1463
01:06:21,740 --> 01:06:25,339
interlocutors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of government making</font>

1464
01:06:23,510 --> 01:06:29,480
decisions about a whole range of things

1465
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:32,330
and so to take<font color="#E5E5E5"> that decision home you</font>

1466
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:35,060
insulate the people who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the front</font>

1467
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:38,350
line ism and you may<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to have</font>

1468
01:06:35,060 --> 01:06:40,009
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> a more kind of arm's length</font>

1469
01:06:38,350 --> 01:06:42,020
discussion and a more thoughtful

1470
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:43,880
discussion about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's what can be</font>

1471
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:45,440
disclosed and what's not I think the

1472
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:48,020
premise ought to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the presumption</font>

1473
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:50,510
ought to be in those situations<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1474
01:06:48,020 --> 01:06:53,360
you have a repressive government that's

1475
01:06:50,510 --> 01:06:57,140
saying this is a violation to even tell

1476
01:06:53,360 --> 01:06:58,550
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> colluded with us I think the</font>

1477
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:01,160
presumption of<font color="#E5E5E5"> be how do we get around</font>

1478
01:06:58,550 --> 01:07:03,680
and again try to find an industry

1479
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:05,450
position that begins to really push it

1480
01:07:03,680 --> 01:07:09,470
it there's got to be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> constant push</font>

1481
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:12,640
back against unreasonable secrecy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1482
01:07:09,470 --> 01:07:12,640
information security

1483
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:19,410
it's a real problem again it kind of

1484
01:07:17,069 --> 01:07:22,670
also comes back to policy advocacy just

1485
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:26,538
so many state secrets laws and laws that

1486
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:30,470
make it much harder for companies to

1487
01:07:26,539 --> 01:07:34,470
communicate basic information

1488
01:07:30,470 --> 01:07:35,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">importantly a strategy yeah we're trying</font>

1489
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:38,819
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do as we talked about to come up with</font>

1490
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:40,470
some standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> for what that muscle so</font>

1491
01:07:38,819 --> 01:07:42,299
that everyone's playing on the same yeah

1492
01:07:40,470 --> 01:07:44,519
that's part of you necessary and

1493
01:07:42,299 --> 01:07:48,569
proportionate morgue that's one effort

1494
01:07:44,519 --> 01:07:50,848
to come up with a common set of totally

1495
01:07:48,569 --> 01:07:53,579
good standards for law at least around

1496
01:07:50,849 --> 01:07:55,470
surveillance and law enforcement but

1497
01:07:53,579 --> 01:07:58,980
this you know I think other efforts as

1498
01:07:55,470 --> 01:08:01,769
well to try it you know if you're a

1499
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:03,569
government that's actually to freedom of

1500
01:08:01,769 --> 01:08:05,069
expression<font color="#CCCCCC"> and privacy you know here</font>

1501
01:08:03,569 --> 01:08:08,130
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> are some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things you should</font>

1502
01:08:05,069 --> 01:08:10,558
should not be doing and more we can have

1503
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:13,950
those principles Adams with common

1504
01:08:10,559 --> 01:08:19,049
statements around and again alliance

1505
01:08:13,950 --> 01:08:21,028
between industry civil society no here's

1506
01:08:19,049 --> 01:08:23,040
what you if you're a government you

1507
01:08:21,029 --> 01:08:25,560
claim to believe in freedom expression

1508
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:27,028
of privacy this is what you need to do

1509
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:29,810
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want companies to actually be</font>

1510
01:08:27,029 --> 01:08:33,299
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect their</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> innocence rights</font>

1511
01:08:29,810 --> 01:08:35,429
so standards for<font color="#E5E5E5"> states yeah standards</font>

1512
01:08:33,299 --> 01:08:38,158
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> states you know this is part of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1513
01:08:35,429 --> 01:08:40,080
you know I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it really goes hand in</font>

1514
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:46,349
hand if you don't have standards for

1515
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:49,120
states in terms of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need law actually</font>

1516
01:08:46,350 --> 01:08:54,610
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> Abel's companies to respect</font>

1517
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:57,370
their users otherwise it just becomes

1518
01:08:54,609 --> 01:08:59,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">what for me if I can just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> add one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font>

1519
01:08:57,370 --> 01:09:00,760
piece which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't talked about</font>

1520
01:08:59,050 --> 01:09:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">which I think it's also part of this</font>

1521
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:07,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">phase it's the issues</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of secrecy and</font>

1522
01:09:05,260 --> 01:09:11,320
privacy and national security becomes

1523
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:13,360
are much less important or less of a

1524
01:09:11,319 --> 01:09:15,099
challenge when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you talk about the</font>

1525
01:09:13,359 --> 01:09:17,529
relationship of companies to their

1526
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,900
customers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that's also part of these</font>

1527
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:21,460
discussions when we talk about standards

1528
01:09:19,899 --> 01:09:23,349
and I know there's a long-standing

1529
01:09:21,460 --> 01:09:24,880
discussion about this i don't think it's

1530
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:28,720
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> been as effective as it needs</font>

1531
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:30,430
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be but companies also the the</font>

1532
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet industry in particular has</font>

1533
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:36,400
basically monetize information about its

1534
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:38,620
customers who are really part of its

1535
01:09:36,399 --> 01:09:41,649
visit their business plans but there are

1536
01:09:38,620 --> 01:09:43,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">all kinds of issues relating to privacy</font>

1537
01:09:41,649 --> 01:09:45,370
in particular that only part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

1538
01:09:43,660 --> 01:09:47,920
discussion that's part of<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights</font>

1539
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:50,680
discussion and certainly companies it's

1540
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:52,260
within their grasp to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out whether</font>

1541
01:09:50,680 --> 01:09:53,940
they want to make public and how

1542
01:09:52,260 --> 01:09:55,920
they want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with those issues I</font>

1543
01:09:53,939 --> 01:09:57,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">think we have to include that in the</font>

1544
01:09:55,920 --> 01:10:02,190
discussion we're talking about human

1545
01:09:57,390 --> 01:10:05,310
rights and writers good well we are

1546
01:10:02,190 --> 01:10:06,750
right at time so would invite any sort

1547
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:08,460
of further discussion with our panelists

1548
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:10,670
but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> meantime thank you all very</font>

1549
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:10,670
much
