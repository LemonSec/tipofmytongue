<font color="#CCCCCC">the reason that we care about this topic</font>

44
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:22,920
is that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> often get asked why do</font>

virtual for instance province and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

49
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:37,920
answer for us is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know as more</font>

00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:41,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">and more people become members in</font>

internet communities in development

52
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,830
better and better understanding of the

54
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,489
where the relationship<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have with</font>

55
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,600
those platforms the more people start to

56
00:02:50,489 --> 00:02:54,120
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their relationship with</font>

57
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:55,709
their data in their speech and how the

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,730
various platforms you interact would

59
00:02:55,709 --> 00:03:01,230
mediate that we believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it's going</font>

60
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be more and more and more and more</font>

61
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:05,518
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> more important for any company on</font>

62
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:08,459
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet to develop odd about</font>

policies that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> pro</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users and to</font>

64
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:12,590
respect to user<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly</font>

65
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,690
and develop a positive trust

66
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:17,390
relationship so it's and that the

67
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:20,140
companies that<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that will also create</font>

68
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:24,559
a more sustainable business in the long

69
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:27,380
so that's our perspective nothing hi I'm

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,390
Jamie Thomas Allen I mean policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

strange title<font color="#CCCCCC"> professional proper now in</font>

73
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,150
its ok policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> and investigation is an</font>

74
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:41,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting role at our organization</font>

75
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:44,810
because it's one that requires many hats

76
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,940
so it encompasses your traditional trust

77
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:49,010
and safety or inbound abuse complaints

78
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,030
those types of issues law enforcement

response so I oversee all of those types

82
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:02,510
of those types of issues so anything

83
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:06,200
that could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be related to trust and or</font>

84
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:09,109
safety and the reason why I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

85
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> important is because it's not a</font>

00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:12,600
question of when you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to have an</font>

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've learned is that being</font>

there are so many employers in the room

there's a proxy that that loads of

I'm very forward to being very complex

00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,889
the sort of more straightforward issues

00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:26,740
around security and dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with mahaan</font>

203
00:09:23,889 --> 00:09:29,829
forcement and then move into some of the

00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:34,449
more complicated issues about shaving

205
00:09:29,829 --> 00:09:37,540
speech you know certain kinds of privacy

206
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:40,540
and so on and so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a small room I</font>

207
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:43,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">would encourage you guys to interrupt</font>

when we actually fight it and then to

risky area for us but it's happening

<font color="#CCCCCC">more and more so from that perspective</font>

of that nature at clouds that we have

very clear policies on how we deal with

worry you can have unless it meets those

311
00:13:55,240 --> 00:14:00,550
angers that you decide your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> company</font>

312
00:13:57,340 --> 00:14:02,440
and you have you really consistent with

those policies you can't be like oh well

314
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:06,700
on this case we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to do but</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this case we'll fight it you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> respond we</font>

about attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> with technical</font>

318
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,900
I guess that's that's one of the things

319
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:16,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've had felt like that if we get</font>

320
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:18,500
a subpoena that's the language of what

321
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:20,330
they're asking for like I know I could

322
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,650
interpret it in the way that they may be

323
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:27,980
intended and satisfy it versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> they talk</font>

324
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:29,750
about use the language like email when

325
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:31,100
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> aren't an email provider because they</font>

326
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:32,840
have some boilerplate like what do you

327
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,970
do in that case<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're like it's pretty</font>

328
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:37,280
obvious like what they intended like is

329
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:38,600
it is it appropriate to they say be

330
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:41,630
jerks about it and just push back to

331
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:43,520
push back on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of that you know yes I</font>

332
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:45,590
mean it technically is appropriate for

333
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:48,890
you do it it depends<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your fear your</font>

334
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:50,300
company's perspective right if you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">looking for a way to push back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

336
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,699
whole process that you can push<font color="#CCCCCC"> back on</font>

337
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,950
technicalities ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you</font>

338
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:57,820
specifically asked for an email account

339
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:01,370
we don't have email you know you respond

340
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:04,520
<font color="#CCCCCC">to sorry I should start this with this</font>

341
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,340
disclaimer I'm not a lawyer I do not say

342
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:09,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">on TV I'm not your lawyer so obviously</font>

343
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:12,500
you need to run<font color="#CCCCCC"> this all buying your own</font>

344
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:13,550
counsel but from our perspective you

345
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:15,350
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen two different things</font>

346
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:17,209
that come please do they either say

347
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:18,820
there's technicalities and so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

348
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:21,400
respond to certain pieces of information

349
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:25,400
because a lot of law enforcement are

350
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:28,040
educated on your technology around other

351
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:29,780
people's technology and so they will

352
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:32,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">send you that traditional isp telco</font>

353
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:36,170
subpoena attachment right they asked for

354
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">like call records or you can choose to</font>

355
00:15:36,170 --> 00:15:41,000
educate law enforcement and try to build

356
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:43,970
a relationship of<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust instead</font>

357
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:46,190
appropriate boundaries and say look we

358
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,810
know that you guys have a job to do we

359
00:15:46,190 --> 00:15:50,610
respect the government if you know we're

360
00:15:47,810 --> 00:15:51,719
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> contrary it is nothing</font>

361
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,730
just for acquisition believe the

362
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:56,279
government has a purpose now trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

363
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:59,899
make your government<font color="#E5E5E5"> better by getting</font>

364
00:15:56,279 --> 00:16:03,170
out there and voting right people but

365
00:15:59,899 --> 00:16:05,730
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces of process are appropriate</font>

366
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:08,969
with due process and judicial review and

367
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,940
so from art from our<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective so when</font>

368
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:12,990
we receive a subpoena or we receive a

369
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,510
court order was an inappropriate

370
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,190
attachment you know I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> completely</font>

371
00:16:15,510 --> 00:16:19,709
pushing back and saying okay we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

372
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:22,709
to respond at all we do use that as an

373
00:16:19,709 --> 00:16:25,018
opportunity to educate those people in

374
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:27,180
law enforcement to say look what you

375
00:16:25,019 --> 00:16:28,589
were asking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> appropriate what</font>

376
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:30,209
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is narrow the scope of</font>

377
00:16:28,589 --> 00:16:31,589
your attachment what you need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do is</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">have an understanding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> technology</font>

379
00:16:31,589 --> 00:16:36,240
what we do because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going to</font>

380
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,070
give you what you've asked for what what

00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:41,310
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to conduct</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:45,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we do is we provide</font>

education to law enforcement to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> FBI</font>

385
00:16:45,690 --> 00:16:49,980
on cloud service providers like this is

386
00:16:48,269 --> 00:16:51,930
what the technology means do not issue a

387
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,420
warrant for this server in a shared

388
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:56,670

you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for is there but you did</font>

really need that content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I highly doubt</font>

397
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,140
you need that content I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push</font>

398
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:18,750
back on it I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask for warrant</font>

for anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that any content related</font>

401
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:26,819
an opportunity to educate law

402
00:17:23,730 --> 00:17:29,669
enforcement and it's actually paid off

403
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:33,960
really well as we've got better more

404
00:17:29,669 --> 00:17:35,100
narrow scope process going forward

405
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,870
and we've actually heard from other

406
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,250
folks that said you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know because you</font>

407
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:39,928
guys were consistent with the

application of your policy and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

409

educated that side of the need for order

410
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:45,240
it didn't surprise me the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> time when</font>

00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:48,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">I went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a different service provider</font>

what I'm supposed to do so it helps so

428
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:39,360
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> during the early days so we</font>

were building<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone in 2007 we knew</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">from the start certain things that we</font>

want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we will</font>

provide a baseline please or privacy a

want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

435
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:53,040
people have access to user data you want

00:18:50,190 --> 00:18:54,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">to have on everything they do they want</font>

437
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">so I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let that sort of on the</font>

00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:00,659
technical side but on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the on the full of</font>

software both side we also knew we had

00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:05,460
to decide what like what our promises

441
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,010
were to our users and that's something

442
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,880
that like when you're just building the

443
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:13,770
neat stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> is hard to stop and think</font>

444
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">about what what are the implicit and</font>

00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:17,879
explicit promises active users it took

446
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:22,010
us<font color="#E5E5E5"> a while to actually write books down</font>

447
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:25,620
we summarize them our CEO of<font color="#E5E5E5"> hosted</font>

448
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:28,080
officially on our blog in 2011 that we

449
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,540
have three logs<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of office to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Commonwealth Office things but a lot of</font>

451
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:35,010
the one was your data is yours our

452
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,489
philosophy is we are we are custodians

453
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:41,670
of your<font color="#CCCCCC"> information we do not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own your</font>

454
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:45,180
data therefore it's not ours to to sell

455
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:49,040
or resell or monetize we are you are

456
00:19:45,180 --> 00:19:52,170
paying us to to alter data your data is

457
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:54,240
is protected we will make our best

458
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:57,060
effort to protect the integrity of that

459
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,710
the data is private by default<font color="#E5E5E5"> only if</font>

460
00:19:57,060 --> 00:20:00,830
you go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of your way to explicitly</font>

461
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:04,350
sure that someone has become public and

462
00:20:00,830 --> 00:20:06,929
third law was your data is portable we

463
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:08,580
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the very beginning said that we</font>

464
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:10,740
must make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you to take</font>

465
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,540
all of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> content out of Evernote at a</font>

466
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,700
moment's notice and take somewhere else

467
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:17,280
so with either<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our desktop</font>

468
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:18,790
applications there's a menu<font color="#CCCCCC"> item to say</font>

469
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,170
exported

470
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,570
the most portable form that i could

471
00:20:20,170 --> 00:20:24,250
think of HTML documents interlinked with

472
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:25,540
all images and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so that</font>

473
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,830
you could talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about your a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">accountant leave tomorrow if you wanted</font>

476
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:35,350
to that was important for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us part of it</font>

477
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:38,379
was important philosophically the

478
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:40,480
founders<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our company had left the</font>

479
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,610
Soviet Union during Soviet days and

480
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">their their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attitude with any any</font>

482
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:49,449
country that you could leave and that's

483
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:51,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was sort of deep in our psyche but</font>

484
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:54,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">from a business perspective from from a</font>

00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:57,129
cold calculating capitalist perspective

486
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:59,950
that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very important to give</font>

487
00:20:57,130 --> 00:21:02,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">confidence that it is safe to invest</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">are doing to to make people feel like</font>

from them from under them at some before

492
00:21:09,670 --> 00:21:13,120
you know realistically this<font color="#E5E5E5"> being in</font>

493
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,790
Silicon Valley like we weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

494
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,070
about of funding selling off furniture

<font color="#E5E5E5">this day we wanted to make sure that the</font>

496
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,990
people felt<font color="#CCCCCC"> like putting hours and weeks</font>

00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:29,140
and months of their life into our

product was was not a risk of their time

499
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:31,570
not a risk of their privacy they

completely

501
00:21:31,570 --> 00:21:37,419
I think a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of companies don't really</font>

502
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:39,040
have a chance to sort of reflect on what

503
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:40,210
that relationship is with our users and

504
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,770
I don't think it's I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

505
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:44,860
one size fits all there are going to be

506
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:46,240
companies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they they they tell</font>

507
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,860
you that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> will take all your phone</font>

00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,480
records<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then send you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it repeats at</font>

every<font color="#E5E5E5"> month that's not concurrently</font>

510
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:54,190
immoral like if if that is a contract

511
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:56,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to get into it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a company</font>

512
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,910
like that's that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as long as</font>

513
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:59,350
transparent as long as like you know

free pizza and that's that's it that's

516
00:22:00,790 --> 00:22:03,820
where I trade off to you I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think</font>

517
00:22:02,170 --> 00:22:06,100
if that's that's wrong but on the other

518
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:08,169
hand that needs to be obvious that that

519
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:10,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to be like explicit and that's</font>

520
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:13,960
what they're selling a rational person

521

00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,930
of treating their information about

guess in that case but um but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a certain amount of</font>

right we're doing no evil with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

558
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:48,370
when we say that we're custodian and it

00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:50,230
try to be transparent and say look this

560
00:23:48,370 --> 00:23:53,800
is what we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be clear</font>

00:23:53,800 --> 00:24:00,129
better net citizens because people have

fairly low expectations right now well

564
00:24:00,130 --> 00:24:05,530
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so there's this idea that as a</font>

the expectations of people from the

713
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:56,439
outside about what you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> spending all</font>

714
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:58,539
of your time on versus the expectations

715
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,159
of what you're doing a 40-person startup

716
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:03,970
that really hope you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can make payroll in</font>

717
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:08,039
whatever the amount of hours that you're

718
00:31:03,970 --> 00:31:10,210
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend on writing out the exact</font>

719
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:11,740
workflow that you would go through if

720
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:14,230
you get exactly this type of support

721
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:16,899
from the government before you've ever

722
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:18,100
had that subpoena before it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

723
00:31:16,899 --> 00:31:19,418
completely unrealistic that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

724
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:21,490
we've been someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a patty</font>

726
00:31:21,490 --> 00:31:24,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time they're trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

727
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,860
which will lead to release out and

<font color="#E5E5E5">training in front of the service stop</font>

729
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:32,429
crashing and things like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think</font>

730
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:34,770
that in general when you see it small

731
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:37,170
companies he<font color="#E5E5E5"> has startup that gets some</font>

732
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:40,020
bad we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting privacy right not</font>

733
00:31:37,170 --> 00:31:42,270
getting security right there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always a</font>

734
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:45,870
lot of snark oh my gosh I can't believe

735
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:47,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">it a positive gotten that wrong from my</font>

736
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:48,659
perspective the almost feels like my

737
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,580
gosh I can't believe it if the one

738
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:52,470
doesn't get it wrong it's hard because

739
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:56,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">you have to get everything right to stop</font>

740
00:31:52,470 --> 00:32:00,990
bad guys all it takes is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> crew yo on</font>

741
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:04,440
one thing to get a wrong and the intense

742
00:32:00,990 --> 00:32:06,210
the intention is I found usually good

743
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,800
it's just don't have time<font color="#E5E5E5"> or resources</font>

744
00:32:06,210 --> 00:32:09,690
to really work on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're looking</font>

745
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the right person to come in and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

746
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:18,060
you get actionable stuff done fast and

747
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:20,430
you often see companies forming these

748
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:22,679
policies after in response to something

749
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that happened great so one we were</font>

750
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:27,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussing earlier it was there was a</font>

751
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:30,930
situation Kickstarter where there was a

752
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:34,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">project that got funded where the author</font>

753
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:36,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the book had made it was a a guide to</font>

754
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:39,879
getting laid

755
00:32:36,669 --> 00:32:42,129
dude the throw thing and the guy have

756
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:43,299
made some sort of unsavory comments

757
00:32:42,129 --> 00:32:46,090
about women<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhere else and the</font>

758
00:32:43,299 --> 00:32:48,460
project<font color="#CCCCCC"> that fact and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what happened</font>

759
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:51,369
people got really upset and put the

760
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:53,379
question to Kickstarter what's our role

761
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:54,939
in either supporting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a not supporting</font>

762
00:32:53,379 --> 00:32:57,459
this type of project right so that's

763
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,960
like a very specific case that tests

764
00:32:57,460 --> 00:33:03,519
your sense of your role as a platform in

765
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">moving things are certain direction sir</font>

766
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,109
you know and having an agenda in

767
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:10,059
addition<font color="#CCCCCC"> to soar your basic</font>

768
00:33:08,109 --> 00:33:12,269
responsibilities and I think it's pretty

769
00:33:10,059 --> 00:33:15,428
hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what they ended up doing was</font>

770
00:33:12,269 --> 00:33:17,559
issuing an apology is that they hadn't

771
00:33:15,429 --> 00:33:19,929
they felt like they should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> hold it</font>

772
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,999
in they<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't it's very complicated and</font>

773
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:23,710
that gets us to the complicated section

774
00:33:21,999 --> 00:33:25,570
of the conversation but<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> point I just</font>

775
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:28,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">wanted to make is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think it makes</font>

776
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:30,668
a lot of sense to try and think of our

777
00:33:28,059 --> 00:33:32,678
as early as possible what kind of

778
00:33:30,669 --> 00:33:34,929
company you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and what kind of</font>

779
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,889
questions are most likely to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font>

780
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:41,139
most immediately so in some cases

781
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:43,059
remember and it's very obviously you

782
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:45,758
know people's innermost thoughts are

783
00:33:43,059 --> 00:33:47,739
<font color="#CCCCCC">recorded here so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Israel or</font>

784
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,570
issue you<font color="#E5E5E5"> should have a pub sort of</font>

785
00:33:47,739 --> 00:33:51,369
which go into this with a perspective on

786
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,168
that with I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think a lot of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

787
00:33:51,369 --> 00:33:57,330
nuanced things it does make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

788
00:33:53,169 --> 00:33:59,499
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> incident you know trigger the</font>

789
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,399
conversation that gets you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the point</font>

790
00:33:59,499 --> 00:34:02,900
breeding

791
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:04,340
policies and you know one of my<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorite</font>

792
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,230
things about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is that we get</font>

793
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:08,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">to experiment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and one of my great things</font>

794
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:09,980
about companies is the way that watching

795
00:34:08,418 --> 00:34:12,710
them respond to crisis and there's this

796
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:15,770
notion of the service recovery paradox

797
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:19,010
where if a company<font color="#E5E5E5"> bought fails and then</font>

798
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:20,360
recovers gracefully like them more than

799
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,760
if they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> never failed in the first</font>

800
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:27,190
place and<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I think you see a lot of</font>

801
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:29,899
that these kinds of policies within to

802
00:34:27,190 --> 00:34:33,770
answer your question a little bit as

803
00:34:29,899 --> 00:34:36,250
well it you do<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to figure out what</font>

804
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:38,989
your company's values as<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mission</font>

805
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:40,730
missions are but how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you communicate</font>

806
00:34:38,989 --> 00:34:42,979
to that how do you communicate that to

807
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:45,139
your customers I mean it's leveraging

808
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:46,460
its really how important is that is it

809
00:34:45,139 --> 00:34:48,230
so important you need to start

810
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:51,470
communicating that on day one if you

811
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:52,490
guys know<font color="#CCCCCC"> what your core values are then</font>

812
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:53,839
yet you will you will start

813
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:55,580
communicating through your blog post

814
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:57,620
you're doing communicated through your

815
00:34:55,580 --> 00:35:00,620
PR are your social media and all of that

816
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,089
it just becomes any tentative speaking

817
00:35:00,620 --> 00:35:03,470
engagement<font color="#E5E5E5"> anytime you guys are going to</font>

818
00:35:02,090 --> 00:35:04,850
meet and talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it because it's</font>

819
00:35:03,470 --> 00:35:07,819
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're probably you know</font>

820
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:10,190
what Mozilla is about right because they

821
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:12,140
evangelize<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad just in everything that</font>

822
00:35:10,190 --> 00:35:13,790
they do you know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that I'm</font>

823
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:16,490
constantly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about a lot how is</font>

824
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,990
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> important</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no talks</font>

825
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:20,089
about how this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a key part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of their</font>

826
00:35:17,990 --> 00:35:22,669
their services you make<font color="#E5E5E5"> it part of your</font>

827
00:35:20,090 --> 00:35:25,250
marketing use it becomes<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of your</font>

828
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:27,350
brand and so you just communicated early

829
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,700
and often and if it changes you

830
00:35:27,350 --> 00:35:30,589
communicate that as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just be</font>

831
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,390
honest and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

832
00:35:30,589 --> 00:35:34,219
you're you want your customers to be

833
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:35,690
evangelists they're more willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

834
00:35:34,219 --> 00:35:38,599
forgive<font color="#CCCCCC"> you make a mistake</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you</font>

835
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,650
apologize it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> about admitting fault</font>

836
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:45,319
it's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> about admitting responsibility</font>

long period of time and<font color="#E5E5E5"> money thanks for</font>

853
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:27,710
the remarks i think is an interesting

854
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:29,239
panel but i do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to push a little bit</font>

855
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:30,829
messy photos if you're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

856
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:32,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues in terms of marketing and</font>

857
00:36:30,829 --> 00:36:34,099
communication but fundamentally we're

858
00:36:32,450 --> 00:36:35,718
talking about human rights issues here

859
00:36:34,099 --> 00:36:39,140
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about people's legitimate</font>

860
00:36:35,719 --> 00:36:41,150
rights so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wonder if perhaps the sector</font>

861
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:42,799
and perhaps small companies and big

862
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,869
companies in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sector are getting a</font>

863
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:47,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit of an easy pass on largely</font>

864
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:49,369
because perhaps user data isn't and

865
00:36:47,089 --> 00:36:51,859
privacy isn't really the most tangential

866
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:54,799
type of human<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights harm that can be</font>

867
00:36:51,859 --> 00:36:57,739
affected so you know the question then

868
00:36:54,799 --> 00:37:00,019
<font color="#CCCCCC">becomes do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you learn from mistakes and</font>

869
00:36:57,739 --> 00:37:02,089
suggesting or is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> a proactive</font>

870
00:37:00,019 --> 00:37:04,578
agenda here<font color="#CCCCCC"> where small companies who</font>

871
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,680
want to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> evangelic evangelical about</font>

872
00:37:04,579 --> 00:37:08,269
these issues can band together and<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

873
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,308
about ways to push back both at the

874
00:37:08,269 --> 00:37:11,749
government level and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this idea</font>

875
00:37:10,309 --> 00:37:13,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">that like we'll just iterate and</font>

876
00:37:11,749 --> 00:37:16,729
eventually we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this right I mean a</font>

877
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:17,989
transparency report from if you compare

878
00:37:16,729 --> 00:37:18,979
transparency report they all look

879
00:37:17,989 --> 00:37:21,140
totally different there's no

880
00:37:18,979 --> 00:37:22,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">standardization so the data book that it</font>

881
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:25,249
becomes somewhat hard to decipher or

882
00:37:22,819 --> 00:37:27,979
gather meaning from so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

883
00:37:25,249 --> 00:37:29,689
is are we<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting our companies in this</font>

884
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:31,450
sector getting it kind of easy in terms

885
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,490
of any other sector where there's

886
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">human rights implications and secondly</font>

887
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:37,509
where is the innovation happening is it

888
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,609
just about putting impound before this

889
00:37:37,510 --> 00:37:41,320
there was one transparency report that

890
00:37:39,610 --> 00:37:43,300
was showcased that had charts and

891
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:45,040
flowcharts and colors and the big

892
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:47,080
innovation<font color="#E5E5E5"> was that they used they</font>

893
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:49,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">packaged data in a different way so I</font>

894
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:51,009
mean is there innovation as protective

895
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,939
of rights are we here innovating about

896
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:57,190
marketing I think was it go back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

897
00:37:54,940 --> 00:38:00,700
before arm essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> a company's the</font>

898
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:02,350
engine and sorts out yes I mean even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

899
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:04,000
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> previous session right they were</font>

900
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:05,710
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with a standard way of</font>

901
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,390
reporting so that we're comparing apples

902
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:10,650
to apples are in the know just oranges

903
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:13,750
so we see that happening we see this

904
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:15,580
push to get startups to be to think

905
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,050
about these issues because<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

906
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:19,569
times it's easier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

907
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:21,270
a user right from a privacy perspective

908
00:38:19,570 --> 00:38:24,400
than from a human rights perspective

909
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:27,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">human rights is a very charged word or</font>

910
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:30,130
phrase it so it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard sometimes</font>

911
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:31,330
if you just walk in and say to your CEO

912
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,610
hey let's see what human rights

913
00:38:31,330 --> 00:38:37,509
violations well you know that's a big

914
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:39,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">deal but from a clown player look from a</font>

915
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:43,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">consular perspective you know there are</font>

916
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">situations where we have people using</font>

00:38:43,390 --> 00:38:47,560
our services websites that use

921
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:58,090

922
00:38:55,960 --> 00:39:00,130
pressure from governments from third

parties that say hey you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take</font>

to be terrorists<font color="#E5E5E5"> speech and that was</font>

926
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,570
something where you know we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sit</font>

down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say okay if somebody comes to</font>

941
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:45,210
political speech issue and that's

942
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:47,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that you know I think there's</font>

943
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:48,960
room for that type of conversation of

944
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,420
all right when you're dealing in

945
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:53,940
especially user-generated content that

946
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,410
human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights issues do come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up but</font>

947
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:58,320
they're not going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be framed that way</font>

948
00:39:55,410 --> 00:40:00,089
because I you can sing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you that</font>

949
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,510
phrase<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights is very frightening</font>

951
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:08,010
there's there's things that might be

952
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:10,410
right that aren't necessarily human

953
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,880
rights I mean if<font color="#E5E5E5"> they like our bar bar</font>

00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:14,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">in our insistence that you can export</font>

958
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:21,960
right thing I do is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not like this was</font>

959
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,279
not so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it's they get that the</font>

00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:27,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of what they're doing really</font>

962
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:29,190
touches on human rights per se but I

963
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,660
think the thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would really help</font>

964
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:32,130
for small companies having gone through

965
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:35,279
this a few times co really help the

966
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:37,470
small companies is is some simple check

967
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">checklists and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boiler plates for privacy</font>

968
00:40:37,470 --> 00:40:42,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">and security that they could follow</font>

969
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:44,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">without having to figure it out from the</font>

970
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:48,000
whole block and not have to take the

971
00:40:44,460 --> 00:40:50,850
entire universe<font color="#CCCCCC"> of every single security</font>

972
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">risk and every single privacy issue</font>

973
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:54,600
come up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> solve them all like is it</font>

974
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally when you've got ten people and</font>

975
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:58,860
you barely material for two months like

976
00:40:57,090 --> 00:41:00,360
like something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they could they</font>

977
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,010
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a twisted time I so I've got</font>

978
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,900
a couple talks lately trying to walk

979
00:41:02,010 --> 00:41:05,430
startups through security and like it

980
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,990
when you have this many employees you

981
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,609
should be doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this which we envision</font>

982
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:10,439
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> realistically you're talking about</font>

983
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:12,690
doing this like I think if<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font>

984
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,130
something for for privacy that would

985
00:41:12,690 --> 00:41:18,360
that would help that that some simple

986
00:41:17,130 --> 00:41:22,740
road maps but that's not going to be a

987
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:26,880
one size fits all I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that not every</font>

988
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:30,000
company is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to have to have the</font>

989
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,840
same constraints around what they do

990
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,790
with date i think the the right to be

991
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:39,210
forgotten as an example if that sort of

992
00:41:35,790 --> 00:41:41,460
his home<font color="#E5E5E5"> for us people spend months</font>

993
00:41:39,210 --> 00:41:42,810
putting together thousands of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:50,790
and delete that casually with a single

997
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:52,500
click of a button is kind of dangerous

998
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:54,600
like that's dangerous for the end user

999
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,730
because someone gets into their come and

1000

me that one's not a black black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

remove the information they put<font color="#CCCCCC"> together</font>

I think that super easy I actually think

00:42:25,259 --> 00:42:28,589
that goes against the<font color="#CCCCCC"> interest of most</font>

not because we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to retain users</font>

1020
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:40,799
that's because we want to prevent

someone from accidentally doing

1022

a sense of know your customer right if

and a lotta I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope that at least</font>

1054
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:58,670
some portion of this could get reduced

know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the you want to be very careful</font>

1135
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:32,470
picking who you work with it was back in

1136
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:35,710
your country and what you know what

1137
00:47:32,470 --> 00:47:38,080
their mindset is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only speak for</font>

1138
00:47:35,710 --> 00:47:39,930
ourselves and tell you what the things

1139
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:42,490
that we think about it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we care about</font>

1140
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,470
but but that's our that's a real issue

1141
00:47:42,490 --> 00:47:49,359
for sure whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> your company's private</font>

1142
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:50,980
or public from your perspective you know

1143
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:54,100
how you apply pressure to third parties

1144
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,540
think that that's a that's a challenge

1145
00:47:54,100 --> 00:47:58,720
when you're small right because you're

1146
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,670
not using market pressure and it's a lot

1147
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">of time the pressure as well i only have</font>

1148
00:48:00,670 --> 00:48:05,050
X amount of dollars I've gotta use I've

1149
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:06,610
gotta use this week has been through

1150
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:08,650
I've got to use somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the cloud</font>

1151
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:10,270
I've got you something i don't have got

1152
00:48:08,650 --> 00:48:13,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">stretch for money as far as i can and</font>

1153
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:16,390
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about i think one of the best thing</font>

1154
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:18,610
that you can do an early stage is be

1155
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:21,549
able to evaluate your risk<font color="#E5E5E5"> now would be</font>

1156
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:23,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say okay I'm doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as much</font>

diligence as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can on this company there</font>

1158
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:26,649
are some basic security controls that

1159
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,120
are out there and whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you</font>

1160
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:31,060
grab<font color="#CCCCCC"> some sort of due diligence</font>

1161
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:32,710
spreadsheet you know to send those in a

1162
00:48:31,060 --> 00:48:35,140
answer these questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me do these</font>

1163
00:48:32,710 --> 00:48:38,770
basic security controls are you you know

1164
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:40,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">ISO 27001 just ask those basic questions</font>

1165
00:48:38,770 --> 00:48:43,100
but get a sense of what their control

1166
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:45,229
and and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what their privacy</font>

1167
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:47,180
policy is if they've got control over

1168
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:49,850
your data or your shipping user data off

1169
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:51,109
but they're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respond to a law</font>

1170

1171
00:48:51,110 --> 00:48:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">their parties or monetize it well then</font>

1172
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:56,690
you've broken your contract with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1175
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:04,839
are like-minded and sometimes you won't

1176
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:07,250
but you've got to be able to say okay

1177
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:09,920
identified who they are and when it's

1178
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:11,920
time to<font color="#E5E5E5"> move will move but yeah it's</font>

1179
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:17,900
difficult trying to at least establish

1180
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:21,170
talk to them about their controls you

1181
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:22,910
mentioned earlier defects<font color="#CCCCCC"> in subpoenas</font>

1182
00:49:21,170 --> 00:49:25,910
and over broad request for information

1183
00:49:22,910 --> 00:49:28,368
things like that I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> curious how</font>

1184
00:49:25,910 --> 00:49:31,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">many times have you gotten completely</font>

1185
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:34,070
paperless requests for information with

1186
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,020
a wink I know Mozilla got a phone call

1187
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,970
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Homeland Security a while back</font>

1188
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,190
asking for certain things<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be done and</font>

1189
00:49:37,970 --> 00:49:43,009
it responded with a letter and Homeland

1190
00:49:40,190 --> 00:49:45,590
Security just went away but it didn't

1191
00:49:43,010 --> 00:49:47,750
stop Homeland Security from making the

1192
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:49,730
effort over the phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I was just</font>

1193
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if this is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

1194
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:53,600
see on a regular basis or if it's rare

1195
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mean just Homeland Security</font>

1196
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">by me any law enforcement agency um do</font>

1197
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">we give it a formal request yes we will</font>

1198
00:49:59,660 --> 00:50:03,470
receive<font color="#E5E5E5"> an informal request was when</font>

1199
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:05,420
people say hey you can you know keep

1200
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:08,529
reminding as<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

1201
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:12,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">oh well you sent me this is our policy</font>

1202
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:14,089
here's our subpoena or subpoena

1203
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:16,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">processes started before they go okay</font>

1204
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:18,950
thanks and come back with process

1205
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:21,290
sometimes those conversations mag

1206
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:22,640
rephrase really have I had a

1207
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:23,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation like that where it was</font>

1208
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:25,819
malicious where they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to get</font>

1209
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:27,740
information without extra sort of

1210
00:50:25,819 --> 00:50:29,750
process part of that may be because

1211
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:31,129
you're really<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked about it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot like</font>

1212
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:32,839
this is our policy<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what we do</font>

1213
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:36,230
that we're very<font color="#E5E5E5"> consistent about it a</font>

1214
00:50:32,839 --> 00:50:38,180
lot of times the conversations are folks

1215
00:50:36,230 --> 00:50:40,700
that don't know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> our policy is and</font>

1216
00:50:38,180 --> 00:50:44,149
they just need the competition fiscal

1217
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:45,890
policy is or they're just getting a

1218
00:50:44,150 --> 00:50:47,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">heads up because they want to make sure</font>

1219
00:50:45,890 --> 00:50:49,730
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're sending a tailored</font>

1220
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:52,280
attachment so we've never had a wink

1221
00:50:49,730 --> 00:50:54,680
wink nudge nudge can you give us an can

1222
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:56,270
we give us information with Allison can

1223
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,240
you give us a customer information a

1224
00:50:56,270 --> 00:51:01,880
billion i have not had that<font color="#CCCCCC"> head of</font>

1226
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,510
about activism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think in the</font>

1227
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:07,160
initial handshake with each of the

1228
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:09,710
organization to figure out what your

1229
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:12,649
procedures and look harder and think you

1230
00:51:09,710 --> 00:51:15,079
figured out about the only thing i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1231
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:18,170
may be relevant would be retention

1232
00:51:15,079 --> 00:51:20,510
requests we are going to be serving you

1233
00:51:18,170 --> 00:51:23,660
with this and we would like you to

we do get the payor to you 48 hours from

1236
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:31,040
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> it will still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be there that's</font>

1237
00:51:28,339 --> 00:51:33,890
probably relevant for for some

1238
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,558
organizations and there's that voluntary

1239
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:38,299
emergency requests where and there is an

1240
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:41,569
emergency situation they can send you

1241
00:51:38,299 --> 00:51:43,009
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can it pretty much that you can</font>

1242
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:45,410
voluntarily provide us with<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1243
00:51:43,010 --> 00:51:46,740
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> because its emergency and</font>

1244
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:48,450
and we go

1245
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,720
that's good<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know but we are not going</font>

1246
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:53,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">to give it to you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font>

1247
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,140
companies have different policies when

1248
00:51:53,790 --> 00:51:59,160
it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> down to if there's that</font>

1249
00:51:55,140 --> 00:52:00,180
imminent harm I know it it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

1250
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,740
for closure because we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> novelistic</font>

1251
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:03,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">provider right we don't have content or</font>

1252
00:52:01,740 --> 00:52:07,140
laws and things of who posted this on

1253
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:08,460
the site at this time but there are like

1254
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,080
social networks to think where it's like

1255
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:11,610
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person is threatening to commit</font>

1256
00:52:10,080 --> 00:52:13,110
suicide right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need this IP</font>

1257
00:52:11,610 --> 00:52:14,850
address maybe their address information

1258
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:16,410
so we can make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they are not</font>

1259
00:52:14,850 --> 00:52:18,180
going to kill<font color="#CCCCCC"> themselves are bomb threat</font>

1260
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:20,190
or some sort of school threat something

1261
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:23,430
like that those emergency request do

1262
00:52:20,190 --> 00:52:25,530
exist and companies do respond to them

1263
00:52:23,430 --> 00:52:27,029
with information because they know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1264
00:52:25,530 --> 00:52:31,020
legal process is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to follow up</font>

1265
00:52:27,030 --> 00:52:34,490
rarely does it not and in those stories

1266
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:37,890
their imminent threat of life or<font color="#CCCCCC"> death</font>

1267
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:40,279
we don't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those because have a type</font>

1268
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:40,279
of content

1269
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:46,180
so you talked about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> position of</font>

1270
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,290
wanting to be as objective as possible

possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> I suspect that is essentially</font>

1273
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:55,310
the easiest<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to do in terms of what</font>

00:52:55,310 --> 00:52:58,190
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like how you deal with whether two</font>

1277
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,820
or whatever else it is the easiest thing

1278
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:04,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do is step away from those</font>

1279
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:07,490
responsibilities to their you can owning

1280
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:09,170
i love the three points so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess what</font>

1281
00:53:07,490 --> 00:53:11,569
I'm curious about is not necessarily

1282
00:53:09,170 --> 00:53:13,370
with y'all but have you seen any great

1283
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:15,620
examples where people do take<font color="#CCCCCC"> that next</font>

1284
00:53:13,370 --> 00:53:16,730
step and say we're an open platform we

1285
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:18,710
try to stay out of this as much as

1286
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:21,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">possible</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a view from</font>

1287
00:53:18,710 --> 00:53:23,810
somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we are like we're pushing</font>

1288
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:25,220
this in the right direction or we're not

1289
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,710
like actually have<font color="#E5E5E5"> some kind of</font>

1290
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:29,470
subjectivity in<font color="#CCCCCC"> their their staffing or</font>

1291
00:53:27,710 --> 00:53:32,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">editorial or whatever they call it</font>

1292
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:35,180
curation something that that allows them

1293
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:38,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">to have policies and platform kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1294
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:41,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">stances that gives them some flexibility</font>

1295
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:43,129
while also contain mostly open<font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

1296
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:46,370
acceptable use policies in terms of

1297
00:53:43,130 --> 00:53:50,350
service give platforms the ability to

1298
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:53,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">make those calls there are a lot of a</font>

1299
00:53:50,350 --> 00:53:54,880
lot of service providers that will take

1300
00:53:53,060 --> 00:53:58,269
down phishing sites that will take

1301
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:00,309
down you know hate speech because they

1302
00:53:58,269 --> 00:54:02,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">part of their terms of service they've</font>

1303
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:05,500
remade into their terms of service so

1304
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,150
what so I'm very<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar those examples</font>

1305
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:10,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm actually only other Gretchen okay</font>

1306
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:12,039
like so things you do want and kind of

1307
00:54:10,569 --> 00:54:14,859
pushing more than that darling<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1308
00:54:12,039 --> 00:54:18,339
anybody thinking about creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> space</font>

1309
00:54:14,859 --> 00:54:19,720
like guide but as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you touch</font>

1310
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:22,420
something right and you actually create

1311
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,379
liability under sites if you like where

1312
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:28,180
to promote something we create a symptom

1313
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:29,680
now we now we're to login for it right

1314
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:31,720
so you haven't<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> business of</font>

1315
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,980
cultivating acting truck charge said I

1316
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:34,660
try to activate<font color="#CCCCCC"> activists so we</font>

1317
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,220
definitely take down ATM charge a sec

1318
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:37,899
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I guess I can make it more context</font>

1319
00:54:36,220 --> 00:54:40,089
but there's also many things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1320
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:43,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">think are actually very good see go</font>

1321
00:54:40,089 --> 00:54:45,400
further but touching them and making

1322
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,230
sure more of your users might see it or

1323
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:49,480
maybe getting it to more people actually

1324
00:54:47,230 --> 00:54:51,670
also creates liabilities Timaeus yeah

1325
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:52,990
yeah so I'm curious<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you see is there</font>

1326
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:56,259
anybody doing it like extraordinarily

1327
00:54:52,990 --> 00:54:58,118
well that is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like for lack of a</font>

1328
00:54:56,259 --> 00:55:02,730
better term is totally subjective like

1329
00:54:58,119 --> 00:55:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">promoting good while mitigating</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stat</font>

1330
00:55:02,730 --> 00:55:07,380
right that is easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the hate speech</font>

1331
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:12,930
line but now there's a whole other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1332
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:12,930
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so hard like time</font>

1333
00:55:13,090 --> 00:55:19,099
if the answer's no it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just interesting</font>

1334
00:55:15,619 --> 00:55:22,460
to but I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just curious no okay so every</font>

1335
00:55:19,099 --> 00:55:23,780
marketplace that I know of does them to

1336
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,310
control what kinds of things happen in

1337
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:28,130
the marketplace whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's air being</font>

1338
00:55:25,310 --> 00:55:30,440
me your uber or Etsy or Kickstarter

1339
00:55:28,130 --> 00:55:33,020
right and so there's this something that

1340
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:34,640
guides the behavior of certain direction

1341
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:38,420
whether it's a set of standards or

1342
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:39,950
inspections or sort of guidelines on on

1343
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:41,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you raise an interesting</font>

1344
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:44,390
question link at what point does doing

1345
00:55:41,780 --> 00:55:46,760
that introduced actual legal liability

1346
00:55:44,390 --> 00:55:49,368
to the platform<font color="#E5E5E5"> Andrew might know the</font>

that well a lot of my show useful is a

1366
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,330
lot of marketplaces do it but it's yeah

1367
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:31,790
you know it's different<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one thing</font>

1368
00:56:29,330 --> 00:56:34,279
for etsy to promote wedding accessories

1369
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:36,740
and for you to promote overthrowing the

1370
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,630
government well means differently it's

1371
00:56:36,740 --> 00:56:40,098
june june / it's okay that usually like

1372

in the marketplace but this is different

1375
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:59,049
you thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> content marketplace in</font>

1376
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:01,119
some ways right so they're used to it

1377
00:56:59,050 --> 00:57:03,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">but they will often pick a cause they</font>

1378
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:05,740
agree with<font color="#E5E5E5"> and promotes it in a big way</font>

1379
00:57:03,339 --> 00:57:07,240
right and claps<font color="#E5E5E5"> are I would say also did</font>

1382
00:57:09,580 --> 00:57:15,069
more of a this<font color="#CCCCCC"> not that's a specific</font>

example<font color="#CCCCCC"> rated as part of our sort of</font>

1384
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:19,089
general philosophy impact factors months

1385
00:57:17,170 --> 00:57:20,950
ago day we fight back and there's

1386
00:57:19,089 --> 00:57:23,650
certain things that we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> but specific</font>

1387
00:57:20,950 --> 00:57:25,060
to like in general always this thing

1388
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:26,950
yeah so I mean I think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font>

1389
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:28,930
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your point it's like we would come</font>

1390
00:57:26,950 --> 00:57:30,399
out in favor of like open internet or

1391
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:33,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">something on behalf</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of like our company</font>

1392
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:35,770
stance on that but like a user starts a

1393
00:57:33,490 --> 00:57:37,419
petition right and it's like a

1394
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:40,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">user-generated content than you then</font>

1395
00:57:37,420 --> 00:57:42,760
don't want to take further that's

00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:54,010
that person to optimize it right that

1400
00:57:50,290 --> 00:57:55,869

<font color="#CCCCCC">yeah there's a bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of questions well</font>

1413
00:58:16,050 --> 00:58:20,850
as 11 is at what point do curatorial

1414

action on a platform impinge on user

1415

rights and and then there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> another one</font>

1416

that was the only signal that we would

1504
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:46,860
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> picture of me when I</font>

01:02:46,860 --> 01:02:53,850
have a mechanism for that because the me

01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:56,540
the little discretion that that has to

1508
01:02:53,850 --> 01:03:02,240
impose on our staff<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to</font>

just that we're not the liability region

1511
01:03:05,970 --> 01:03:10,669
because for efficiency reasons your

1512
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:13,380
staff didn't happen and I remember

1513
01:03:10,670 --> 01:03:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">policy yet for that we have official</font>

1518
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:28,430

1521
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:33,740
formal<font color="#CCCCCC"> policies to define exactly what</font>

the steps are for someone to do it

1523
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:39,620
formal take down based on the content is

1524
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:42,950
one of the independent process separate

putting in human rights protection

1537
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:13,310
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you never know who's going to</font>

01:04:11,450 --> 01:04:14,899
use your platform so<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you start off</font>

so<font color="#CCCCCC"> just something to consider I think</font>

we'll leave that thank you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> all your</font>
