1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:08,039
okay so 400 plan this as a fireside chat

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,080
so there's really very little structure

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:13,829
to it and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to add them as</font>

4
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:15,960
much food as possible we have been

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,800
thinking about you know the rolling

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:24,260
around human rights work and we thought

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:26,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">that having a freedom personal nature</font>

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,460
journalist and benefit could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a big</font>

9
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:32,520
mix for us to better understand how to

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:35,730
move it to our a world where you know

11
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:39,510
inclusion is a it's a it's a very huge

12
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:41,430
and the service of a German second so

13
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:43,769
that's kind of where this panel is

14
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:49,649
coming from and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> will tell you a little</font>

15
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:52,620
bit of why I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the same so I am</font>

16
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:54,920
advocating SS and work led human rights

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,269
program and benefit when I take is a

18
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,670
nonprofit technology company based in

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:03,449
the Silicon Valley<font color="#CCCCCC"> wherever that is not</font>

20
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:06,619
here and that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> providing a free</font>

21
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:06,619
and open source information

22
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:14,920
presently we are increasing<font color="#E5E5E5"> interested</font>

23
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:18,670
in importing journalists mostly<font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font>

24
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:21,930
they all laughed<font color="#CCCCCC"> with human rights</font>

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:24,790
defenders for example you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they are</font>

26
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:26,080
another civil society with that sort of

27
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,460
our county building business fights

28
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,630
injustice it's also a group that is

29
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:34,289
under tremendous pressures from

30
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:38,920
governments and organized crime and

31
00:01:34,290 --> 00:01:41,229
probably most importantly is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:44,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">are in the same way that gun rights</font>

33
00:01:41,229 --> 00:01:46,600
practitioner are they are tasked with

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:48,820
collecting and storing information of

35
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:51,699
some of the people some of the most

36
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:54,039
vulnerable populations out there so we

37
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:57,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">think that is important for us to</font>

38
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:58,960
contribute to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work just a bit of</font>

42
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:08,949
to our perspective<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh this is what about</font>

43
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:11,680
providing you know strong crypto let us

44
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:15,640
know it will call you no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem it's</font>

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,890
from people and we think that struggling

48
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:24,940
Emerson journalistic work mostly because

00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the reasons that the people like us</font>

abundance of the moment correlations or

53
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,040
surveillance so that's a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of</font>

54
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:38,010
why I'm here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's definitely for me</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the next few decades you know we really</font>

76

start an organization to highlight the

Obama administration has approached

81
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:53,140
prosecuting sources is that they really

82
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">decide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually go after the</font>

84
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:58,988
cases you'll see that they subpoenaed

email providers<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party email</font>

86

providers and their phone call providers

87
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,799
basically circumventing the way that

88
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,450
they would have gone after sources for

89
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:10,989
decades which is to get journalists to

90
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:13,629
testify in court against them you know

91
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:20,310
for since<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 1970s journalists have</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">been that banding together and basically</font>

and prosecute prosecutors figured out

96
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:31,510
about six or eight years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago that they</font>

didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to start paying reports</font>

testifying

99
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,189
easier ways to do it so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know they've</font>

100
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:39,719
figured out their investigations over to

101
00:04:38,189 --> 00:04:41,819
the initial conversations rather than

102
00:04:39,719 --> 00:04:43,889
after the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact of court and so now I</font>

103
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">think journalists are starting to</font>

to protect their sources through

encryption<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of cases using</font>

108

the Mafia a corporation that you're

175
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:29,710

176
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:32,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">to stress that anybody covering anything</font>

177
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:36,770
needs to be thinking about their sources

178
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:39,848
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just too</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to two so much other</font>

sources to these needs of surveillance

180
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:46,010
so so one thing about for my given that

181
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:48,260
you know you are the greatest of all

182
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,670
because they're here so early and feel

free<font color="#E5E5E5"> to interrupt us you know to bring</font>

let's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> wait until the end it's a</font>

187
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,150
might river right there it's also you

188
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:04,430
can just shout but but so I have the

189
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:06,650
sense that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the different vision</font>

190

192
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,980
to think that is because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the</font>

193
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:15,410
recent revelations of surveillance among

00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:16,940
other things<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> allowed us to</font>

195
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:19,819
understand that data can be collected

196
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:24,350
adjusted a value 1 over x you were just

197

00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:28,990
something

199
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,370
that we have all on the same plate we

may differ<font color="#CCCCCC"> in terms of like you're</font>

used by everyone to use all the time for

00:09:35,139 --> 00:09:42,069
example to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be something level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it be</font>

204
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:44,529
flying in any<font color="#E5E5E5"> way but before we discuss</font>

205
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:46,269
that is this a debate that I don't think

206
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,220
we have sufficiently discussed and it

207
00:09:46,269 --> 00:09:50,949
somehow army is this community and the

208
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,279
idea of<font color="#E5E5E5"> open demo body and I'm a part</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

209
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:57,790
a Cell you gotta go to take no political

210
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,350
debate but my sense is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the</font>

211
00:09:57,790 --> 00:10:02,439
products that are advocating for strong

00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,870
hint of our alignment about to drop to

213
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:07,329
the field and there's very little

214
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:10,690
conversation<font color="#CCCCCC"> about open education which</font>

215
00:10:07,329 --> 00:10:12,729
is again another way that I find is

216
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:14,290
quite straightforward and you come to us

217
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:17,829
of an encryption with someone had to be

218
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,269
right but<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it a issue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the one that is</font>

by the NSA revelations especially what I

00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:30,620
mean you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think you're talking</font>

about more<font color="#E5E5E5"> broadly than just encryption</font>

00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:47,529
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company's knowledge and so I</font>

269
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:51,260
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> all of this lends to the</font>

00:12:47,529 --> 00:12:53,060
conclusion that for something<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,240
remotely trusted it has to be open

source of even then there's you know

273
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:03,740
still a lot of argument to be had but

274
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:07,540
you know the case for source software

general<font color="#E5E5E5"> things ever been from stronger</font>

wasn't it there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 27 32</font>

278
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:23,310
there was a variety<font color="#CCCCCC"> of steps okay i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font>

282
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:38,610
from a practical standpoint I would like

00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:41,310
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see more people using encryption even</font>

it's somebody turning on final<font color="#E5E5E5"> bullet</font>

they're one of the most disruptive

328
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:53,220
things that could happen would be to

329
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,930
increase the usability business as

that's going to protect them and

commonly protect them pretty well

depending on who it is that's angry at

with regard to other technologies that

359
00:17:11,869 --> 00:17:17,689
would be a very good next step is to

in why they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> more usable and more</font>

00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:48,440
building these apps are usually

437
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:50,209
photographers or you know hackers people

438
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:52,700
who have sysadmin backgrounds who are

439
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:54,560
really interested in security but don't

440
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:58,550
necessarily think about usability

441
00:20:54,560 --> 00:21:01,760
because they've been steeped in you know

442
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,639
this type of technology forever and they

443
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:05,680
take it a sense

444
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,840
don't understand that regular people

445
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:12,160
non-technical people can understand it

446
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:17,169
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is our various barriers that I</font>

447
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:21,340
think you know these types of tools need

448
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:23,800
to get over to really reach the<font color="#CCCCCC"> masses</font>

449
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:25,720
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that could make a huge</font>

450
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:30,399
difference i mean you know in some

451
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:33,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries if you're using tor you know</font>

452
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,690
your IP address<font color="#CCCCCC"> kami like you know they</font>

453
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,970
can't believe you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing over tour but</font>

454
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:38,410
if they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> accessed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the entire network</font>

455
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:41,830
they can see the IP<font color="#CCCCCC"> addresses that</font>

456
00:21:38,410 --> 00:21:43,330
actually connect to it and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

457
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:44,980
huge problem when not a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

458
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:46,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">are connecting the tour so they put</font>

459
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:49,000
everybody out but if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are millions</font>

460
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,020
of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it for example then that</font>

461
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:54,550
problem slowly disappears but again it's

462
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:57,010
you'll see this problem we're over again

463
00:21:54,550 --> 00:22:00,090
with any improvement tool encryption

464
00:21:57,010 --> 00:22:03,820
tool and they're just<font color="#CCCCCC"> on easy solutions</font>

465
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:07,510
unless we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a lot more money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

466
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:10,990
talent and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot more development skills</font>

467
00:22:07,510 --> 00:22:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to usability and you know I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

468
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:16,030
this problem has become the prevalent in

469
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">the last year or so it's really to</font>

470
00:22:16,030 --> 00:22:20,720
compare that that usability is actually

471
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:24,590
a security issue and if

472
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:28,580
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break their hard to use and</font>

473
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:30,408
people will eventually fail and so the

474
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:34,990
quicker everyone would last that the

475
00:22:30,409 --> 00:22:37,669
better so yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can hardly sit with</font>

476
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:39,590
others from point O usability should be

477
00:22:37,669 --> 00:22:42,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">over social security teacher</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that should</font>

478
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:45,770
be safe in the numbers and one think is

479
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:48,020
one thing too many prison what version

480
00:22:45,770 --> 00:22:49,940
i'm sick and i think it's interesting

481
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:54,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in this venue but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

482
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,890
about the challenges<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know for me</font>

483
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,510
much is the creation of the adoption and

484
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:01,130
you guys are<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking about that I don't</font>

more about involved effort that you're

of all that they play in the field<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

490
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,990
a health perspective or practical

491

perspective but also given that your

492
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,120
major is different there than position

00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:32,749
that's acute probable over the next week

499
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:36,739
sure so I mean I couldn't give a little

500
00:23:32,749 --> 00:23:39,999
background as if your God first so we

501
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:44,840
secure was originally created by

502
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:46,639
Aaron Schwartz and in about a year

503
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:49,279
before you dive with kevin poulsen is

504
00:23:46,639 --> 00:23:52,758
actually here<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the audience</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today the</font>

505
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,779
wire an investigation center and its

506
00:23:52,759 --> 00:24:00,529
basic premise is to combine a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

507
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:02,779
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we know work into a much more</font>

508
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:07,789
usable format so right now it looks like

509
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:11,690
is we are finding the use of tour the

510
00:24:07,789 --> 00:24:13,908
use of gpg encryption and use of<font color="#CCCCCC"> trails</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the operating system the only board last</font>

512
00:24:13,909 --> 00:24:21,350
night and essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> our goal is to</font>

513
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,119
lower the barrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> for sources who want</font>

514
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:25,789
to submit documents<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> journals but</font>

515
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:27,649
don't have a way of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it email even</font>

516
00:24:25,789 --> 00:24:29,629
if you're using encryption the meta data

517
00:24:27,649 --> 00:24:31,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">can be back to your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> email address if you</font>

518
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:33,408
<font color="#CCCCCC">ever try</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a truly anonymous email</font>

520
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:38,989
it's close to impossible you know if you

521
00:24:35,239 --> 00:24:40,369
want a gmail address<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to neither</font>

522
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,539
have another phone number or another

523
00:24:40,369 --> 00:24:42,980
email address so if you want another

524
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:45,889
phone number you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to school of</font>

a pact with to get a burner phone to

then when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally get that and have</font>

531
00:24:55,990 --> 00:25:02,260
to go to a coffee shop that you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

532
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:03,760

any other internet connection it could

be associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> you so it's really</font>

537
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:15,010
really important and the mistakes we

538
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:20,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">made and so secured awkwardly tries to</font>

539
00:25:15,010 --> 00:25:23,080
lower these problems another<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font>

540
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">secure job goes after is the this</font>

541
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">third-party model that I mentioned</font>

542
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:30,159
before you know the prosecutors figured

543
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:32,350
out that they can subpoena their own

544
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,720
email providers for journalists or

545
00:25:32,350 --> 00:25:36,699
sources emails and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists won't</font>

546
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:39,700
find out until after so secure job takes

547
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:43,840
away<font color="#CCCCCC"> third-party completely the secure</font>

548
00:25:39,700 --> 00:25:45,010
drop servers sit in the journalists we

549
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend their their</font>

550
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:51,190
general counsel's office at this point

551
00:25:46,450 --> 00:25:54,190
and the source is logging in through a

552
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:56,260
web applications so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is no third</font>

553
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:58,000
party to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> subpoena they can only go to</font>

554
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:01,540
the journal as an organization if they

555
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,820
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> any type of data and prosecutors</font>

556
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:06,520
are loath to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this they will avoid</font>

557
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:09,230
this at all costs and<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very rare</font>

558
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:11,990
times they do their base with two

559
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:13,610
for your legal path and then so the

560
00:26:11,990 --> 00:26:17,570
final problem we try to solve as the

561
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:19,490
meta data which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know there are in</font>

562
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:23,840
all these cases you will see that that

563
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:25,340
they will try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out who these</font>

564
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,290
sources are talking to you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> that met</font>

565
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:30,350
that in their house so we try to log as

566
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:33,260
little men that it's possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

567
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:35,418
<font color="#E5E5E5">metadata do blog is deleted regularly so</font>

568
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,160
even at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this giant legal</font>

569
00:26:35,419 --> 00:26:40,400
battle hopefully there will be nothing

570
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:44,480
for prosecutors to get and so that's

571
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,549
basically the idea is that we're trying

572
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:48,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to solve the problems that cropped up in</font>

573
00:26:46,549 --> 00:26:54,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the past decade because of all just</font>

574
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:56,630
digital surveillance and but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

575
00:26:54,410 --> 00:27:00,020
they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> always facing is that as we've</font>

576
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">been talking about security is hard you</font>

577
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:02,720
know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can make it easier for the</font>

578
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,490

actually go there physically on the site

to help them install secure drop after

we install it we will sit there and

587
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,870
train their journalists and how to use

<font color="#E5E5E5">tools that you can use more broadly and</font>

594

use them<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then hopefully they can</font>

spread this knowledge more

00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:58,549

afraid I can't say their names but

607
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:29,449
they're some of the bigs makers in the

obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> 19</font>

00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:56,260
other forms of surveillance so you can't

00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,539
you have more more privacy because you

668
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:20,639
right how's Jefferson had a friend who

00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:25,229
created<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cipher that I think 2009 I</font>

00:31:20,639 --> 00:31:28,738
think it was broken using supercomputers

671
00:31:25,229 --> 00:31:32,639
I mean there was more opportunities

672
00:31:28,739 --> 00:31:34,649
through just the lack of these

673
00:31:32,639 --> 00:31:37,998
technological tools to have private

you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be trapped into that field</font>

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> could be tiny recording device</font>

the parallel collectors and the other

679
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,419

681
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:58,320
journalists really do have a duty to

00:31:56,669 --> 00:32:00,599
learn these things it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is part of the job</font>

you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put in the effort and so I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">more privacy in the past where they</font>

00:33:30,530 --> 00:33:34,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the 1980s because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

723
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">reason he was convicted was because the</font>

724
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,570
journalism organization handed over

725
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,150
photographs that he allegedly gave them

726
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:47,500
with his fingerprints on so you have to

727
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:50,530
worry about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can obviously mail</font>

728
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:52,630
your home mailbox because they can trace

729
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:55,120
back to you so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go to a</font>

730
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:57,550
public location hopefully not anywhere

731
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,159
near<font color="#E5E5E5"> where you regularly visit with</font>

732
00:33:57,550 --> 00:34:03,100
surveillance cameras on the way and once

733
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:05,350
you do all this put<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the mail and</font>

734
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:06,669
you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no way of them communicating</font>

735
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:08,918
with the report or whether they ever

736
00:34:06,670 --> 00:34:11,440
received it whether they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> questions</font>

737
00:34:08,918 --> 00:34:16,899
and if they can do anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it so</font>

738
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:19,480
it's very hard no matter what medium

739
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:23,219
you're using to communicate to

740
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:25,810
completely avoid surveillance for

741
00:34:23,219 --> 00:34:29,020
potentially the IRS inators after the

742
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:33,250
fact and so I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

743
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:37,120
people come to us as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 safer than</font>

744
00:34:33,250 --> 00:34:40,179
security depends in many cases that may

745
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:41,799
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> be so this is all all things that</font>

746
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:50,110
sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> internals have to be aware of</font>

747
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:52,389
that they may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have tattoo before I</font>

748
00:34:50,110 --> 00:34:54,370
know you mentioned making up secure drop

749
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gateway drug towards</font>

750
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:59,200
being secure online and I also know

751
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,270
earlier the talking were speaking about

752
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,939
how you want everybody marketing

753
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:06,220
usability etc how would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you say the best</font>

754
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,170
way is for young people I'm talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

755
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:10,569
junior high and high schoolers doing

756
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:13,360
their first-ever campus paper whatever

757
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:16,690
it is to start to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

758
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:18,520
issues because those habits that they

759
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">found when there's not a confession are</font>

760
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:22,840
going to be there sort of default habits

761
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:25,210
what would be your best use case

762
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:28,930
scenario<font color="#E5E5E5"> for somebody in their teenage</font>

763
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:32,550
years to become a secure digital citizen

764
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:34,549
who might ever be a citizen<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalist</font>

765
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:34,550
I

766
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:47,319
so I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it would be</font>

767
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,500
important especially for us<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think of</font>

768
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:52,480
the to think of the problem their

769
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:54,619
companies are behind the management of

770
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,750
sources

771
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:02,309
so nobody that's rapidly aboard the

772
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:06,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">train and open source that would what</font>

773
00:36:02,309 --> 00:36:08,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">about so be seeing over time to be very</font>

774
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,788
different they have to say that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

775
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,019
working on his paper it kid I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

776
00:36:11,789 --> 00:36:15,269
probably the most important thing would

777
00:36:13,019 --> 00:36:21,240
be to play the<font color="#CCCCCC"> exerciser you know man</font>

778
00:36:15,269 --> 00:36:23,390
having the information about ethical

779
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:26,390
exercise and a technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> point</font>

780
00:36:23,390 --> 00:36:26,390
information

781
00:36:29,550 --> 00:36:34,980
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first thing that</font>

782
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:38,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">anybody needs to do is be aware what's</font>

783
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:40,860
happening I mean there has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> losing a</font>

784
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,600
sea change in the way people view

785
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:44,970
privacy ever since they at least feel

786
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,790
revelations partially because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

787
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:50,069
didn't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of people have said</font>

788
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,750
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people didn't even take didn't care</font>

789
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:54,150
in the past I think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wasn't in</font>

790
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:57,540
their purview and so they had an easy

791
00:36:54,150 --> 00:36:59,460
day to ignore it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> now they don't you</font>

792
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:01,020
know people say that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> the people say</font>

793
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:02,880
that younger people don't care<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

794
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:04,560
privacy as much there's been two recent

795
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,480
studies that<font color="#CCCCCC"> showed actually when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

796
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,660
look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> their much more conscious of the</font>

797
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">privacy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> settings on social media than</font>

798
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:14,370
older adults<font color="#CCCCCC"> off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually restrict</font>

799
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:18,150
information more you soon as the way

800
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:20,430
they have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving to applications</font>

801
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:22,080
like snapchat that will delete the

802
00:37:20,430 --> 00:37:25,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">messages as soon as they send them and</font>

803
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:29,790
so I think young people are actually

804
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:32,190
aware this issue at least in the general

805
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:34,710
sense because their natural instinct is

806
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:36,540
is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> want privacy despite the fact that</font>

807
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:41,460
they're always<font color="#CCCCCC"> online i was posting</font>

808
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:44,520
things publicly and so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the way</font>

809
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">to get young people involved is to make</font>

810
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:49,440
these products more accessible to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

811
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:52,069
who haven't necessarily thought about

812
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,579
the need for antenna diversionary

813
00:37:52,069 --> 00:37:58,279
potentially is and that goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

814
00:37:55,579 --> 00:38:00,049
house were discussing before<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just</font>

815
00:37:58,279 --> 00:38:02,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">realize that our events to end like</font>

816
00:38:00,049 --> 00:38:08,559
eight minutes or so so maybe we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

817
00:38:02,209 --> 00:38:10,940
just take the curlers right bro yeah

818
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:12,229
yeah I can't when people say they have

819
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,089
quick questions but I have two quick

820
00:38:12,229 --> 00:38:15,799
questions in a long one when you send us

821
00:38:14,089 --> 00:38:17,660
in the fireside chat so i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try to</font>

important than the you that gray so one

about all the stuff you know I for the

out to gmail again<font color="#E5E5E5"> for party providers</font>

854
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:46,529
to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> use these media companies</font>

into doing this stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> more it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

protecting the privacy of your readers

00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:56,580
it's about<font color="#E5E5E5"> making sure that your</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">review of our experiences things so the</font>

866
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:18,430
second part of the question was how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

867
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:18,430
of you people here have security

<font color="#CCCCCC">credit is encrypted okay so the problem</font>

869
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,870
I've encountered with organizations you

870
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,670
guys are all encountering it is it's

871
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:34,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">really hard to get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them to do this I</font>

872
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:37,050
work with organizations<font color="#CCCCCC"> tepic reporters</font>

873
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:39,270
and protecting reporters they don't have

874
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:41,730
your encrypted email how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a</font>

875
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:44,130
penny over that area I'm kind of like a

876
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:46,410
long to find immunity i would say that

877
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:47,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">did you afford on human rights work in</font>

878
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:51,690
Norma listen you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> the responsibility</font>

879
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:53,069
to protect responsibility today<font color="#E5E5E5"> we know</font>

880
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:55,680
that one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that you can do</font>

881
00:40:53,070 --> 00:40:57,630
is rely on open source strong people so

882
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,009
you're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using it the road leading up</font>

883
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:02,990
to the standard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're supposed to</font>

884
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:02,990
be government economic very dogmatic

885
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:09,960
when you're trying to me organizations

886
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:13,500
the skill<font color="#CCCCCC"> level and the awareness level</font>

887
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:14,730
varies widely I mean there are I heard

888
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:17,550
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other day that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a major</font>

889
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:19,440
news organization that outright refused

00:41:17,550 --> 00:41:20,730
to install pgp for the reporters

891
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:22,490
covering for actually left this

892
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:25,020
organization probably for this reason

893
00:41:22,490 --> 00:41:27,060
because he had a bunch of national

894
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:28,380
security sources<font color="#CCCCCC"> league he couldn't talk</font>

00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">to and he couldn't get the technical</font>

896
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:33,810
help needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk to them but I think</font>

897
00:41:32,430 --> 00:41:35,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good news is that in the past six</font>

898

ignore me they just don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

901
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:44,869
they have to do and it's also a larger

902
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:48,859
problem for them it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

903
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:51,109
one-size-fits-all solution you know they

00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:52,910
have a variety of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different threats you</font>

trying to you know Chinese hackers

trying to get into their corporate

911
00:42:03,769 --> 00:42:08,598
network and so they have all<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font>

00:42:06,489 --> 00:42:13,519
attempts to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> into account when they</font>

decide to implement something zation why

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's why I actually have sympathy for</font>

sources that are losing their<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights</font>

918
00:42:23,559 --> 00:42:29,930
when it comes to us apenas but it's also

919
00:42:26,749 --> 00:42:31,419
protecting them organization-wide in a

920
00:42:29,930 --> 00:42:34,749
better way<font color="#CCCCCC"> than maybe possibly do</font>

against<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chinese hackers so you know its</font>

922
00:42:34,749 --> 00:42:42,109
securities Mary I mean exactly we were

923
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:46,180
sort of using earlier the fourth panel

924
00:42:42,109 --> 00:42:48,949
about whether it's freelancers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for major</font>

925
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:51,850
institutional media organizations that

926
00:42:48,949 --> 00:42:54,280
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> more actively engage these things</font>

927
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:56,020
and often wonder whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's veteran</font>

928
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:57,220
reporters talk to some of that<font color="#E5E5E5"> use as</font>

929
00:42:56,020 --> 00:43:00,130
well that's not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> different from when</font>

930
00:42:57,220 --> 00:43:01,810
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was reporting abroad in actions and I</font>

931
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,260
just think about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it i'm used to think</font>

932
00:43:01,810 --> 00:43:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">about these things or if it's the cub</font>

933
00:43:05,260 --> 00:43:10,720
reporters who are more familiar with

934
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:12,540
technology i would say that to the

935
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:16,540
extent that there is a feeling of

936
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:19,140
privilege or remove you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think a</font>

937
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:22,000
large organization might feel that

938
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:28,000
lawyers by training sometimes feel that

939
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:29,560
we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> targeted that</font>

940
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:33,160
should just be thrown out pulling that

941
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:39,070
we've seen incredible aggression for the

942
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:40,810
press from this administration time for

943
00:43:39,070 --> 00:43:42,940
one last question and but before we

944
00:43:40,810 --> 00:43:45,520
tackle that just<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would like us to</font>

945
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:47,200
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> given we don't have time just info</font>

946
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:49,180
you know what are the piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

947
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,580
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are missing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the</font>

948
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:53,799
problems are our and solve the<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs are</font>

949
00:43:51,580 --> 00:43:54,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">met and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think of them and we</font>

950
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:57,520
have a few seconds after the next

951
00:43:54,970 --> 00:44:01,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">question from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rolling over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here or using</font>

952
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,290
the issue in the guidance<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the panel</font>

953
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:12,070
because many girls the world heart

954
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:22,879
for the ceiling

955
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:24,740
yeah it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great question i would love</font>

956
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:27,710
to scale it as much as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible I mean</font>

957
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:29,689
the problem we have right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> is purely</font>

958
00:44:27,710 --> 00:44:33,770
we just don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough manpower we</font>

959
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:36,170
have you know one person James Dolan who

960
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:38,570
was one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the original developers on</font>

961
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:40,400
this perfect who's working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

962
00:44:38,570 --> 00:44:42,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">full-time who's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the journalism</font>

963
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:44,360
organizations to help them install a

00:44:42,290 --> 00:44:46,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">keys troubleshoot it with people we</font>

965
00:44:44,360 --> 00:44:47,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">can't actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> physically go there you</font>

966
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,030
can email<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and we'll try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> answer</font>

967
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:52,160
questions we're also trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

968
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:54,880
installation process much easier it's

969
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,799
already<font color="#E5E5E5"> gone a long way from where was</font>

970
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight or ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> months ago where it was</font>

971
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,790
there was a security audit by<font color="#E5E5E5"> Bruce</font>

00:45:00,020 --> 00:45:03,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">Schneier and State University of</font>

00:45:01,790 --> 00:45:06,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">Washington researchers which basically</font>

974
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,069
said that and then click<font color="#CCCCCC"> install and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

975
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:12,830
we have really tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the</font>

976
00:45:10,070 --> 00:45:14,540
documentation online a lot better it's

977
00:45:12,830 --> 00:45:16,670
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> a complicated process right now</font>

978
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:18,110
but it's doable if you have technical

979
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:21,170
skill the installation process is

980
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:23,990
definitely the hardest part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it all we</font>

981
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,180
are currently<font color="#E5E5E5"> also looking for funding</font>

982
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:28,129
so we can hire two or three<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people</font>

983
00:45:26,180 --> 00:45:31,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">to work on this project whole time so we</font>

984
00:45:28,130 --> 00:45:34,000
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually go internationally and how</font>

985
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:36,230
organizations in different countries

986
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,510
install secure drop basically the only

987
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:44,510
reason that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is</font>

988
00:45:38,510 --> 00:45:45,090
because it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> based and it's easy for us</font>

989
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:49,830
to reach

990
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:52,590
so if the weather we can expand<font color="#E5E5E5"> Adam s</font>

991
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:55,700
will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it here effective 81</font>

992
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:58,320
very brief point as with circular draw

993
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:00,149
really the installation or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

994
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:02,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">opportunity cost getting people over</font>

995
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:04,590
that hump to actually get them to use

996
00:46:02,370 --> 00:46:06,560
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> tools is often the issue people</font>

997
00:46:04,590 --> 00:46:08,790
can use these tools it's a matter of

998
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:11,220
getting given to install them getting

999
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:15,180
them to start using them and as you said

1000
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:19,049
it's a there many gateways to digital

1001
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:22,049
security so it's emotion and this last

1002
00:46:19,050 --> 00:46:23,550
