1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,420
I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody else feels I</font>

2
00:00:02,909 --> 00:00:08,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of combination of being</font>

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:10,500
extremely exhilarated and extremely

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,120
exhausted at the same time and I was

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:13,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to scribble down some notes of</font>

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,178
things that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say and I had</font>

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,800
this feeling<font color="#E5E5E5"> like I just couldn't</font>

8
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:22,189
actually think anymore i just have taken

9
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:29,390
in so much information and met so many

10
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:33,200
met so many people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was thinking</font>

11
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:35,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I've had some had some very positive and</font>

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,140
feedback from people that I've spoken to

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,610
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess the people who haven't had</font>

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:43,770
positive feedback haven't come and

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:48,629
spoken<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me but feel free to hurt but</font>

16
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,980
maybe tomorrow not today and I I was

17
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:51,510
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why this conference has</font>

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,489
been so special and I think one of the

19
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:56,730
reasons why is that it is so<font color="#E5E5E5"> unique is</font>

20
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,180
because it is actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> a civil society</font>

21
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,910
owned organ organ<font color="#CCCCCC"> a civil society owned</font>

22
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:05,549
conference that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought governments</font>

23
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:08,189
and corporations into this space and

24
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,799
created a kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of an environment in</font>

25
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:14,580
which conversations can happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

26
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,729
we can debate and be honest with<font color="#CCCCCC"> each</font>

27
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,350
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> and also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge each other and</font>

28
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:21,479
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we talked right at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning</font>

29
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:23,789
about you know gathering a room of

30
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:26,158
experts and making unreasonable demands

31
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,900
and which was the quote from earlier and

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,970
I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of feel like we have done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

33
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:34,439
and I look forward to more unreasonable

34
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:36,750
demands the conversation seems have been

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,829
much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more mature than the conversations</font>

36
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,220
in 2011 I feel as though the lexicon has

37
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:46,380
actually changed and and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

38
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,030
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a shared lexicon and new words</font>

39
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,399
in that lexicon as well but also a

40
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:53,130
capacity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be able to communicate with</font>

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,079
each other across diverse they call the

42
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">groups and diverse issues and I think</font>

43
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,389
any most of us who have kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of hopped</font>

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:04,700
between different rooms have seen like i

45
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,869
went from the LGBT session which was

46
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:09,179
amazing and this just listening to some

47
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:11,899
of the voices there and then all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

48
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:11,899
into

49
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,700
the Export Control discussion which was

50
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,189
about the Western<font color="#E5E5E5"> our agreement and how</font>

51
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:22,980
we're going to stop the sale and the

52
00:02:20,189 --> 00:02:26,129
transfer<font color="#CCCCCC"> of technologies that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would do</font>

53
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:28,819
people harm across borders and just the

54
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:31,170
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of diversity of the depth and the</font>

55
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,420
expert nature of the conversation and I

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:35,219
think I said in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opening session and</font>

57
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,649
just about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extraordinary level of</font>

58
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:39,930
expertise and I think our level of

59
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,939
expertise has actually gone one step up

60
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:45,299
I feel like I have learned an incredible

61
00:02:41,939 --> 00:02:46,950
amount and I feel like<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody here I</font>

62
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:51,930
hope has also learned an incredible

63
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:54,720
amount and what we have in a way is like

64
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:59,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">a global network of digital rights</font>

65
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:02,099
defenders here and and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a real</font>

66
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,849
possibility to grow this network and

67
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,250
this is the 700 people or so who were

68
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:09,209
here and then there's thousands more and

69
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,010
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's a real</font>

70
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:12,780
opportunity to double<font color="#E5E5E5"> and redouble and</font>

71
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:14,280
could rip all that effort as the

72
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,769
challenges would become greater and the

73
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,599
possibilities become greater and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font>

74
00:03:16,769 --> 00:03:19,799
to us also<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier about at the</font>

75
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,018
beginning of the session about outcomes

76
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:23,669
and like what are the outcomes of the

77
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,099
conference and you know I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

78
00:03:23,669 --> 00:03:29,159
let's build coalitions action plans or

79
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,959
even just the next step and I've been

80
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:32,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">talking to a few people just casually</font>

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,109
and scribbling stuff down and I feel

82
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">like there's so many outcomes that have</font>

83
00:03:34,109 --> 00:03:38,819
come from this conference and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many</font>

84
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:41,189
that are yet to come as well even<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

85
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:43,048
the possibility of meshing another

86
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,549
person I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the beginning I was like</font>

87
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">took somebody in the room who you don't</font>

88
00:03:44,549 --> 00:03:48,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">know I think it's much harder to find a</font>

89
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:55,109
person in the room<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you don't know</font>

90
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:57,478
now and and so you know just a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

91
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:59,280
random outcomes that from conversations

92
00:03:57,479 --> 00:04:01,769
that I have and incidentally<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

93
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:06,900
going to be a document that's going to

94
00:04:01,769 --> 00:04:08,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">be put up later on today which has a</font>

95
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,349
whole collection of outcomes which the

96
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,909
policy team headed by your Chi has

97
00:04:10,349 --> 00:04:13,738
pulled together through all the sessions

98
00:04:11,909 --> 00:04:15,720
there's been accessed staff and

99
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,840
volunteers taking notes and pulling

100
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:24,389
together one outcome per per group and

101
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:25,219
well you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys sort of say not every</font>

00:04:24,389 --> 00:04:27,260
group

103
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:29,000
but it's a living document as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so</font>

104
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,440
we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a draft up at the end so you</font>

105
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,750
have an opportunity if you want to send

106

108
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,890
now org if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> any outcomes even if</font>

00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:41,270
it's something small or something large

posts which has a<font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility please</font>

113
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:48,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">include that in the outcomes document so</font>

114
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:50,630
that we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a sense of why all of us</font>

115
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:53,090
spent all of these days together and

116
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:55,219
what the possibilities are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward</font>

00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:58,340
you know the global<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a global</font>

it sounds obvious to us but it actually

apparently<font color="#CCCCCC"> got cleared by the NSA so</font>

it's a step<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward we've seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also the</font>

137
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:49,640
like the MBLAQ group that met experts a

dozen of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to try and fix that broken</font>

system the digital rights fund which I

proposed at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> beginning of 50 million</font>

00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:59,630
dollars is now a hundred million dollars

142
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:00,950
which I'm really<font color="#CCCCCC"> excited about about 50</font>

143
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,430
million bucks that can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make it 100</font>

144
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:06,650
million and what we could do with that

145
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:09,200
the rapid responders group met which is

146
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:11,780
22 people across the world who are

147
