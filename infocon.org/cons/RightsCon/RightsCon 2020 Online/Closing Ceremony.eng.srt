and it is my absolute pleasure to be

11
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,079
moderating the closing ceremony to what

12
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,200
has been

13
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:01,839
an incredibly inspiring exciting and

14
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,880
also exhausting week at roscon

15
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:08,080
um i want to start on a personal note to

16
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,799
say how incredible i find it

17
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,640
that each one of us is sitting right now

18
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,520
in front of a small screen

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,879
in many different corners of the world

20
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,760
with different backgrounds

21
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,679
literally speaking yet here we are

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:24,640
emerging after we could run

23
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,680
with a strong sense of community with

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,040
great deal of

25
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,640
enthusiasm energy creativity and

26
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,799
resilience

27
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,480
and this really gives me a great deal of

28
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:37,599
hope

29
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,840
knowing going forward that somehow

30
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,760
we are ready for the challenges ahead

31
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,040
from the imminent threat of the

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,200
ongoing covenanting pandemic to many of

33
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,319
the structural and systematic problems

34
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,760
it has unearthed and intensified in our

35
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,640
societies

36
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,000
racial social economic injustices and

37
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:59,040
discrimination

38
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,159
colonization and its continued legacies

39
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:08,079
patriarchy surveillance capitalism

40
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,159
you name it um and

41
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,440
sometimes i feel like whenever we look

42
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,399
around there are so many

43
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,920
fires and smoke uh it becomes sometimes

44
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:20,159
difficult to

45
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:22,640
look up for a clear patch of blue sky

46
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,879
and as cheesy as this sounds to me right

47
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,238
scoring did exactly that

48
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:31,760
it brought us together as a community it

49
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:35,120
gave us a space to think collectively

50
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,280
to be in solidarity and the boundaries

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,400
of many of the issues we're

52
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,840
grappling with and i want to

53
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,599
stop here and pause to reflect as we're

54
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
convening

55
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:51,679
now on on many of the people and

56
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,040
communities who are currently on the

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
front lines

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,879
fighting for human rights protesting on

59
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,518
the streets

60
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,480
fighting back in courts and many of our

61
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,519
behind bars

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,319
for speaking up and for defending our

63
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
rights

64
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,480
in egypt in india in myanmar

65
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,799
and many many other places and

66
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:15,119
just to like give a an overview and

67
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,680
highlight what has been happening this

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,239
week

69
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,799
as all of all of us has have got

70
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:21,279
together

71
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,719
to discuss digital rights issues and

72
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,599
internet freedoms

73
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,120
um in hong kong for example this week

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,160
four student

75
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,199
activists have been arrested and charged

76
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,400
under the newly adopted

77
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,400
national security law

78
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,880
even in countries where democratic

79
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,880
safeguards exist on paper

80
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,199
many governments continue to undermine

81
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,360
freedom of press

82
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:52,400
and attack independent

83
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,160
media and independent non-profits in

84
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,638
hungary for example

85
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,880
the editor-in-chief of the biggest

86
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,039
independent online news site index

87
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,880
was fired following imminent political

88
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,880
and financial pressure

89
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,800
then the full editorial board of 80 to

90
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,560
100 people also resigned

91
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,720
and now they are facing retaliation

92
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,840
we're also very disturbed by the recent

93
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
news that uh

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:20,479
from the u.s uh that the open digi fund

95
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:22,320
fund is bringing eighty percent uh

96
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,560
of internet freedom projects and

97
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
services to a complete halt

98
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
due to arbitrary and unnecessary delay

99
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,479
in funding

100
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,198
jeopardizing lives of millions of users

101
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:35,120
who rely

102
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:39,120
on their technologies worldwide

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,960
and the list of human rights violations

104
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:46,160
is really long and uh it's pretty grim

105
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:49,599
but bring it to a lighter

106
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,199
uh note uh i want to mention one of my

107
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,680
favorite book titles

108
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:55,280
by african-american author and poet

109
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
alice walker

110
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,638
it's called hard times require furious

111
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,719
dancing

112
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,479
and maybe if we were in costa rica

113
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
that's what we would probably do

114
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,280
after the closing ceremony but given

115
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,719
where we are i would say

116
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,119
hard times require radical imagination

117
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,039
so following one week of many

118
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,240
interesting discussions on the issues

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,719
we're grappling with

120
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,000
thinking forward how can we build just

121
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,160
equitable systems for

122
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,479
the future how can we have technologies

123
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,800
that

124
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:29,360
connect us without preying on our

125
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,840
privacy and personal data

126
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,199
what kind of internet in the future we

127
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
would like to have

128
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,639
and to help us think through these

129
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,720
questions and share with us

130
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:41,199
their visions for the future uh

131
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,479
reimagining our presence

132
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,639
i would like to welcome our

people

159
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,880
that must be taken into account

160
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,479
regarding the digital divide and access

161
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,479

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
we're in the middle of the pandemic so

176
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,840
um

177
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,520
we have to make the most of it so nobody

178
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,080
imagined before the pandemic

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,000
that the world were living today and the

180
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,680
arrival of the virus with no doubt at

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,599
all has challenged the impact that

182
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,880
technology has on today

183
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,559
today's society and human rights um

184
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,919
as from the ancient american commission

185
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:41,439
on human rights

186
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,079
during the context of the kovit i myself

187
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,920
have seen the importance of technology i

188
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
have been able to have a dialogue

189
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:49,760
with different organizations and leaders

190
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,719
of indigenous people throughout the

191
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,959
americas

192
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,560
something that before we wouldn't do so

193
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,079
i think um

194
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,880
it has shown us the importance of

195
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,040
technology we have been able to observe

196
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,360
how a large group of indigenous leaders

197
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,880
have have appropriated the technology

198
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,120
they have been using cell phones

199
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,080
community radios televisions

200
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:12,320
production of videos instant messages

201
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:15,360
and that's beginning to be part of the

202
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:17,200
daily life and they're using technology

203
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
as a form of cultural and political

204
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,880
resistance

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,600
developing and community communicating

206
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,000
strategies

207
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,120
on their right to autonomy and

208
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,279
self-determination

209
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,959
my myself have been have been in

210
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,000
meetings with indigenous people from the

211
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,160
amazons

212
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,120
and you see them with their cell phones

213
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,360
moving around

214
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,320
even upon trees and i'm not joking when

215
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,160
i talk about that

216
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,720
to have access to internet and to be

217
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,079
able to meet with the commission

218
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:47,600
so of course um this the pandemic

219
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,920
is something that has been awful for the

220
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
for

221
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:54,560
for the world today but also it has um

222
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,959
required us to seek opportunities about

223
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
in

224
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,000
indigen i mean technology and

225
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,200
before talking about the inter-american

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,360
human standards i

227
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,279
i i think we have to make ourselves some

228
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,800
questions especially regarding the

229
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,959
the people that are here with me today

230
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,800
and and also the people that are

231
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,079
listening to us today

232
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:16,000
there's a lot of questions on how how we

233
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:17,439
can seize opportunities which also

234
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,480
supports indigenous people

235
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,480
in addressing the gaps and challenges we

236
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,920
must ask ourselves how does technology

237
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:26,160
treat indigenous people

238
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,160
how much of that treatment is with their

239
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,319
participation and consent

240
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:32,079
do indigenous people have the same

241
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,959
possibilities of making use of

242
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,599
technology

243
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:36,640
as other actors in society does the

244
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:38,880
different

245
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,959
meet does a youth story of different

246
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,279
media contribute to the transmission

247
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,199
of their historical memory or their

248
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,760
physical and cultural survival

249
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,440
on the contrary as some indigenous

250
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,000
leaders pointed out on some of the

251
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,800
events

252
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
that took took out this week does the

253
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,599
access

254
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,079
to different media put at risk their

255
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
heritage and may even mean an extinction

256
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,439
of their culture

257
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,439
what can organizations that work with

258
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,240
new technologies and human rights like

259
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
accessnow do to guarantee the access of

260
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,320
indigenous people

261
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:13,120
to internet to information what can the

262
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:14,720
organizations do for capacity building

263
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,399
especially regarding to the elders of

264
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,399
the indigenous communities

265
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,839
the elders are essential in transmitting

266
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,160
their culture and heritage

267
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:23,680
to the younger ones but they do not

268
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,959
understand the use of these new

269
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,719
technologies

270
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:28,000
there are urgent matters that we must

271
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,839
focus on

272
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,760
there are so many issues to be addressed

273
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,279
and undoubtedly many have been discussed

274
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,959
through these days

275
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,800
and it seems to me that rice con has

276
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,959
been very visionary when it raised these

277
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,479
matches before the pandemic

278
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:45,680
and of course today wisconsin 19

279
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:48,079
and it has been palpable to to us the

280
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,439
the the digital divide more palpable

281
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,319
than ever

282
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,800
and in that sense um before addressing

283
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
and

284
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,160
the question you asked me what we're

285
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,000
talking about

286
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,000
indigenous people and access to

287
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,120
technology when we're talking about

288
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,079
the digital divide and the gap we're

289
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,639
talking about

290
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,519
um for example last week in deutsche

291
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,240
welle

292
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,040
uh showed the case of a quechua family

293
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,200
in the nd

294
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:15,360
and then region whose children had to

295
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,440
walk every day to the highest mountain

296
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,720
to connect with one cell phone for the

297
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,040
three children

298
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,480
to have classes online that is what

299
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,719
we're talking about when we talk about

300
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:28,160
indigenous people and technology

301
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,200
and the gap that we see today on the on

302
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,439
another case

303
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,320
with the teacher who works with mapuche

304
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,839
children

305
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,200
who do not have technology they don't

306
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:36,959
have access to internet they don't have

307
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,760
computers they don't have cell phones

308
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,479
and so what did her teacher do she goes

309
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,600
every week

310
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,480
once a week on her horse to visit all of

311
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,639
her students

312
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,320
and give them homework and the week

313
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:49,440
after that she goes and gets the

314
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,480
homework

315
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:55,519
and gives them new homework so of course

316
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,920
the digital um gap is the

317
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
importance when we talk about inclusion

318
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,599
when we talk about

319
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,880
democracy when we talk about a

320
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,440
democratic society

321
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:06,000
in a post-pandemic world and we must

322
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,240
take

323
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,360
charge of these issues urgently and in

324
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:12,800
that sense

325
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,680
um the the american human human rights

326
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,319
commission

327
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:18,839
and the inter-american court we do have

328
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
some standards on these issues

329
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:23,120
um and those standards are first of all

330
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,760
in the declaration

331
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,480
on the rights of indigenous people it

332
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,200
says

333
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
the article 14 says and i'm i'm sorry if

334
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,200
i read it but i think it's important to

335
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:35,360
see that we already have standards

336
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:37,040
on these issues it says that indigenous

337
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,760
people have the right to promote and

338
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,599
develop

339
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,839
all their communication systems and

340
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
media including their own radio and

341
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,240
television programs

342
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:48,959
and to have equal access to all other

343
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,279
forms of communication and information

344
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,279
states shall take measures to promote

345
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,160
the broadcasting of radio and television

346
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,160
programs

347
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,160
in indigenous languages particularly in

348
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:59,120
regions where there is an indigenous

349
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
presence

350
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,959
present states shall support and

351
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,800
facilitate the establishment

352
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:07,119
of indigenous radio and television

353
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,079
stations as well as other means of

354
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:10,880
information

355
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,680
and communication this of course what i

356
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:14,480
have just read

357
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:15,439
is crucially the pandemic context

358
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,360
because despite the

359
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:19,360
despite the widespread situation of

360
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,199
limited access to the media

361
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,639
we have seen the importance of

362
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:25,040
information campaigns

363
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,360
that indigenous people have developed to

364
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,040
inform their members about kvid19

365
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,279
and prevention measures in their own

366
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,599
languages thus ensuring

367
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:36,240
the cultural relevance of these means of

368
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:38,399
information transmission

369
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,279
and the inter-american commission has

370
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,040
has a

371
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,800
resolution resolution 120 and that is

372
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,800
precisely about the pandemic and human

373
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,560
rights and it has recommendations for

374
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,959
the states of the oas

375
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,119
regarding different issues relating to

376
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:56,079
the pandemic of course and human rights

377
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:58,160
but one of the issues is exactly that

378
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,279
states must guarantee

379
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,760
um that the peoples especially

380
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,800
vulnerable groups have access to

381
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,040
internet and all

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:09,120
other kinds of media we're talking about

383
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:12,399
a continent were 23

384
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:14,959
20 sorry 23 of the population today

385
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,000
does not have any access to internet the

386
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,399
inter-american

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,440
development bank bank has said that in

388
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
latin america

389
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,519
indigenous people have less than half

390
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,480
the access to mobile phones

391
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,600
than the non-indigenous peers in bolivia

392
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
internet access

393
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,399
is four times less for indigenous people

394
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:34,959
than for non-indigenous people

395
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,639
access to a computer is far less for

396
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:39,119
indigenous people in bolivia

397
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,720
brazil peru and colombia and that

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,079
implies an evident

399
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:47,519
digital exclusion if we don't address

400
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,120
these issues of course it has an impact

401
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,160
on human rights it has an impact on

402
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,680
democracy

403
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,600
and that is one of the issues that the

404
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,319
commission has been working on with the

405
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,160
repertoire and freedom of expression and

406
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,720
then that's why we think that this

407
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,719
issue is so important and what you have

408
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,399
been discussing this week especially

409
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,480
not only for indigenous groups but all

410
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,000
vulnerable groups and especially

411
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,480
in the context we have today of the

412
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,800
pandemic because the pandemic

413
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,839
of course has apparently is here to stay

414
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,639
for a long time

415
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,480
so access to internet has of course a

416
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,320
whole dimension on democracy and human

417
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,759
rights and how we can access to and

418
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:24,399
guarantee human rights to

419
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,279
everybody and like just to finish

420
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:28,320
regarding the

421
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,839
these kind of situations and i just want

422
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,000
to mention we have a case

423
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,199
today that has just been sent to the

424
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,600
inter-american court

425
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:36,959
regarding regarding these issues we're

426
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,240
discussing today

427
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,680
about um the indigenous people of pango

428
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,120
in guatemala

429
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:46,719
and community radios all the

430
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,959
legislation in guatemala i'm not going

431
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:50,000
to go through the details of the of the

432
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:53,439
case but all the

433
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:57,040
legislation in guatemala um

434
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:00,079
is against is against the inclusion of

435
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,680
of human rights of indigenous people

436
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,439
and we have a case which is going to be

437
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,520
very important on these issues

438
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,880
the case is from april we sent it to the

439
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,480
court in april

440
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,400
just when the pandemic was starting but

441
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:13,520
i think it's going to be very important

442
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,760
because we will um be able to

443
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,119
to discuss in inter-american standards

444
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,599
on a on a case

445
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:21,599
for the very first time in the presence

446
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,760
of the inter-american court i think

447
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:26,159
um those are my first remarks i have

448
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,039
been a bit um

449
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,840
um messy to to to talk about so many

450
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:32,080
issues

451
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,760
there's not much time but once again i

452
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,320
want to thank you this invitation and i

453
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,879
think

454
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,879
this is a very important issue if it was

455
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,919
before the pandemic today

456
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:43,760
is absolutely crucial that states

457
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,360
international organizations and

458
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,320
technology companies also

459
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:50,240
address the gap address this digital

460
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,879
thing because it has

461
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:54,720
of course it has it's very important for

462
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,799
the internet for the people

463
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:59,280
and democracy in the americas and the

464
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,160
whole world

465
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,840
thanks a lot for capturing the main

466
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
struggles of the indigenous communities

467
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:06,879
and peoples around the world

468
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,959
especially when it comes to access to

469
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:12,480
the internet and new technologies i

470
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,960
will move the conversation to nick um

471
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:17,120
and i mean nick you are um the the

472
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,520
editor of one of the prominent magazines

473
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,559
on

474
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,200
uh technologies and the impact uh

475
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,080
uh of these technologies on our on

476
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,200
politics

477
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,159
and uh societies and from where you sit

478
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:31,600
also thinking into the future what do

479
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,760
you think is coming ahead of us

480
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,639
and i mean being right now at wright's

481
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,799
con

482
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,240
obviously it's a conference on the

483
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:40,480
intersection of human rights and

484
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,600
technology so how can we

485
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:46,240
mainstream human rights into

486
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,320
new technologies that are emerging from

487
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:49,200
silicon valley but also in many other

488
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,120
parts of

489
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:56,720
the world oh that's a fabulous question

490
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,559
i mean the way i think about it is that

491
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,960
the struggle for democracy and human

492
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,240
rights with respect to technology is the

493
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:04,799
story of our times

494
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:06,480
when these technologies were invented

495
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,559
when they first started to

496
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:10,960
become a big part of our lives 20 years

497
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,639
ago it seemed to me inevitable

498
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,880
that the internet by connecting people

499
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,640
by making information accessible to all

500
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:18,240
would just accelerate democracy and

501
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:20,640
would increase human rights

502
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:22,400
and accelerate equality and what we've

503
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:25,120
seen is that over time there's actually

504
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:26,799
the opposite has largely happened it's

505
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,360
helped authoritarian states

506
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,480
in many cases it's pushed democracy to

507
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:32,879
the background it's

508
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,240
actually accelerated inequality but i

509
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,039
think what's happened in the last couple

510
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,520
of years

511
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,720
and it's reflected in the success of

512
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,918
rightscon

513
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,240
extraordinary things that have been

514
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:43,919
discussed at rights cons the initiatives

515
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:46,320
that have been launched at wright's con

516
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,919
it's become clearer and clearer that

517
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:49,520
everybody is realizing that

518
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,200
it's also clear to a certain degree in

519
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,039
the anti-trust hearings we had in the

520
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,480
united states just two days ago

521
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,720
so i think the conversation about

522
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,240
technology is changing

523
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,240
the initial assumption was that

524
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,400
technology would ineluctably

525
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:03,600
bring about more democracy civil rights

526
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,440
human rights

527
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,639
now pretty much everybody is realizing

528
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,000
it's not the case so

529
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,320
the next couple years are going to be

530
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,799
about that struggle how to build

531
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,840
basic rights into common artificial

532
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:18,158
intelligence

533
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,879
how to use technology to empower

534
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:22,159
media and fair reporting as opposed to

535
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,039
to disempower it

536
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,400
how to use technology to facilitate

537
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,960
democracy as opposed to just to

538
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,880
facilitate authoritarianism so

539
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,480
that is a way of saying i can't tell you

540
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,520
exactly what's coming in an answer to

541
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,240
your question

542
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,080
but i feel better about where we are at

543
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,760
least in the conversation

544
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,760
than i did a couple years ago

545
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:50,799
the age of innocence thinking that the

546
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,000
internet will liberate the world to age

547
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:54,879
of experience where

548
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,559
exactly uh the conversation or the focus

549
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,000
on human rights should be right at the

550
00:20:56,559 --> 00:21:00,000
center

551
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,360
of new technologies i want to dig a

552
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
little bit further in something you

553
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,320
mentioned

554
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:06,400
given that many independent media

555
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,600
agencies and organizations are currently

556
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:10,400
under attack

557
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,639
what needs to be done for these

558
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,880
organizations to survive

559
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,960
what is required from our community and

560
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,760
also from governments

561
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,320
international organizations maybe other

562
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,679
media

563
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:27,520
organizations as well to keep

564
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,280
freedom of press afloat in these times

565
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,200
yeah well you know there was a proposal

566
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:33,440
earlier this week at access now for

567
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,960
public funding of independent media

568
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,400
organizations

569
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,200
make them less independent if they're

570
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,200
publicly funded but public funding for

571
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,799
fair media organizations across the

572
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,200
globe which i thought was a very

573
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:46,320
worthy initiative one of the big changes

574
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:48,480
that needs to happen

575
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,559
is for the algorithms which distribute

576
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,280
readers and in some ways distribute

577
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:54,799
economics to make sure that they are

578
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:57,520
prioritizing truth

579
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,158
prioritizing people who are doing their

580
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,960
best

581
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,559
to get things right to not use the

582
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,280
algorithms to just prioritize

583
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:06,240
outrage and emotion i think that is the

584
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,240
fundamental

585
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:10,640
error of the social media platforms over

586
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:11,440
which them so much democratic discourse

587
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,400
happens

588
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:16,240
so the extent that the algorithms and

589
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,440
the artificial intelligence that powers

590
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,240
all these

591
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,039
can push us towards truth accuracy

592
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:23,120
fairness

593
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:24,640
that ultimately does help the media

594
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,760
organizations and then it's also

595
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,840
incumbent

596
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:29,840
upon the media organizations this is one

597
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,000
of the struggles that wired

598
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,520
to build viable business models

599
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,120
certainly the united states we had a

600
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:37,440
long period where

601
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:39,600
you know there was a monopoly on a form

602
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,000
of advertising that monopoly

603
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,439
disappeared it's the way capitalism

604
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
works capitalism is often paired with

605
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:47,679
democracy and so it is incumbent

606
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,959
upon media organizations like wired to

607
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:51,280
identify

608
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:53,440
new business models and for the public

609
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,320
to recognize the civic value

610
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,280
of what organizations like this do and

611
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:59,200
to support it

612
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,399
so it's a combination of government

613
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:05,520
action philanthropic action

614
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:07,440
people the journalists themselves

615
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,720
and the underlying structure of the

616
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,840
internet all

617
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,520
have to act in unison to recognize that

618
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:16,480
civil society

619
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:22,000
democracy works best if the press can be

620
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:25,679
free and the press can be fair

621
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:26,960
thanks a lot nick i will move now to our

622
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,720
third speaker

623
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:32,799
uh zade um i'm so happy you're with us

624
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,840
and i will totally take advantage of the

625
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,400
fact that we both come from the same

626
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:38,879
region

627
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,159
as a palestinian i want to hear your

628
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:43,039
views

629
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:44,000
um about uh and your vision as well

630
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:46,000
about the region

631
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,279
uh many regions around the world but

632
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,360
especially ours where

633
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,880
there seems to be like an interesting

634
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,279
contradiction

635
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,000
on the one hand we're still dealing with

636
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:56,960
age-old

637
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,240
problems like unemployment poverty war

638
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:00,000
bloodhead

639
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,600
and yet at the same time many

640
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,799
governments in

641
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,840
in region trying to rush to adopt new

642
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,760
technologies

643
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,840
such as digital ids and other biometric

644
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:14,400
uh data processing technologies like

645
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:17,439
contact tracing out and so on

646
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,760
with very little regard to human rights

647
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:22,559
what do you think is the way forward for

648
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,080
us to get out of this uh

649
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:31,440
this crisis of priorities i should say

650
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,080
uh well thank you marwa for inviting me

651
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,120
i'm delighted

652
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:36,720
to be here today the day of the the eid

653
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,520
i should be having a day off but i'm

654
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,679
happy to be

655
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,840
here with all of you and thank you brett

656
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,640
and nikki it's been an amazing week i've

657
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,799
enjoyed

658
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
all the fireside chats and i've enjoyed

659
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:48,639
the panels and

660
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,600
even for many of us who've worked in the

661
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,840
space when we feel

662
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:54,080
we've begun to know there's always

663
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:55,678
always the odd surprise the

664
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,840
piece of detail that you didn't know

665
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:00,480
beforehand and it makes this

666
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,360
an immensely rich conference and so

667
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,080
thank you for

668
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:05,520
having me i'm going to begin by not

669
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,399
answering your question

670
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,960
um in in the in this sort of first part

671
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,840
of my

672
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,240
response i think listening to nick you

673
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,918
know i

674
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:19,840
i can't but help feel that the digital

675
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:23,039
age in one way has dehumanized us

676
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:27,360
um it has created out of our lives

677
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:30,720
bits we've become shadow individuals

678
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,799
parlayed from one

679
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,840
firm to another our lives are in bits

680
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:39,840
our thoughts are in bits our economies

681
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,120
are in bits our political life

682
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,918
is in bids and when we speak about the

683
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,039
regulation

684
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:50,000
of this space i would argue that

685
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,799
less speaking or less paying attention

686
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:54,000
to

687
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,400
the legal regulation we need to invest

688
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
more into thinking about the contextual

689
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,559
regulation of the space

690
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,240
the the world in is falling apart as

691
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,200
we've heard time and again over the last

692
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:05,039
few days

693
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,279
and i'll come to the middle east and or

694
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:10,240
the mena region in a few minutes

695
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:11,200
and and that is what will determine

696
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,600
eventually

697
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:16,159
where the tech industry needs to go and

698
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,639
i'll give you a quick example

699
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,360
the situation between china and the us

700
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,400
is very

701
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,439
concerning to to everyone and

702
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:27,760
through a series of miscalculations

703
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:30,080
we could easily see a giant

704
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,960
confrontation between two nuclear powers

705
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,439
it's not

706
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,640
difficult to foresee this so let's

707
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:38,240
assume

708
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:41,120
that the and you can see china being led

709
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:42,400
toward a very nationalistic position and

710
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,879
so is the u.s i mean

711
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
president trump makes no sort of bones

712
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,000
about it

713
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,918
let's say for the sake of argument we do

714
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:51,600
have something short of a conflict or a

715
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,480
conflict in being

716
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,678
and if i was a chinese-american living

717
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,080
in the u.s

718
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,720
i'd be very concerned right i mean we've

719
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:01,760
seen this

720
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,240
before there weren't there won't be

721
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,840
internment camps but it's quite possible

722
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,520
that the us government would approach

723
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:10,158
the big tech companies

724
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:11,039
and tell them give me everything about

725
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,919
all my

726
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:15,120
chinese citizens i need to know what

727
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:17,600
they're up to

728
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,600
and it's at that point where the tech

729
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,399
companies are going to be tested

730
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,279
and and there we will see what position

731
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:26,479
they're going to take

732
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:29,600
i'm not convinced that many will not

733
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:31,279
turn over the data i think one or two

734
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,719
leaderships i'm impressed by i'm not

735
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:35,600
impressed by the rest

736
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,320
and and that would be the telling point

737
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,678
um and i

738
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,320
i hope we can sort of talk about that

739
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:42,960
the middle east yes it i i mean i a few

740
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,439
years ago

741
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:46,000
i was spent a week in silicon valley i

742
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,200
was

743
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:51,600
amazed by what i saw in technology terms

744
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,520
and then 10 days later i was in in

745
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,879
tripoli in libya

746
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:57,360
and i mean a a a situation where there

747
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,919
was

748
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,439
absolutely no law and order complete

749
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,679
insecurity

750
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,720
violence of the most terrible kind and

751
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,720
the people living

752
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:08,000
on the great anxieties not knowing

753
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:11,120
whether they're going to live

754
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,039
another day and it occurred to me

755
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:14,879
that really the the space between

756
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,080
silicon valley and libya

757
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,880
was not so great it was not so great

758
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,320
uh if you imagine a cyber war where the

759
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,240
electric grid is

760
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,320
is you know killed off in this country

761
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,080
by and large i live in the united states

762
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:30,320
you know how soon would it be before we

763
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,080
become like a libya already with covet

764
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,520
we can see the stresses and strains of

765
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,879
society here

766
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,600
you know and so it is we are trapped in

767
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,320
this

768
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,399
in this uh sort of space where we seem

769
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,760
to be unable to graduate and lift

770
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,719
ourselves out of the

771
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,760
misery that so many people experience on

772
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,760
a day-to-day basis

773
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,480
i have i have also a positive message

774
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:00,960
but i'm going to leave it to the end

775
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,919
i mean i have one uh one additional

776
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,760
question for you

777
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:05,440
being the former high commissioner for

778
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:08,879
human rights um

779
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,399
and this year is the un's uh

780
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,640
75th anniversary and

781
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,879
what i wanted to ask you like what must

782
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:19,840
change to ensure the relevance

783
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,039
of the un bodies in the digital age like

784
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,918
how can we

785
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,080
uh and our communities maintain watch

786
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,080
the human rights pillar which is

787
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,199
unfortunately the least funded of three

788
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:33,279
pillars

789
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:35,039
of the u.n well you know

790
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:37,120
to all of us in the human rights

791
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:39,039
community we understand the importance

792
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,120
of it it's surprising actually how many

793
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,080
outside of our community don't

794
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,399
understand it

795
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:46,639
especially in the global north i mean it

796
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:48,879
hardly ever figures into

797
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,320
business literature you hardly ever see

798
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:53,679
it in academic literature

799
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,360
outside of legal literature or the work

800
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,120
done specifically on human rights it's

801
00:29:55,360 --> 00:30:00,158
quite amazing to see

802
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,279
um look the the un is a reflection of

803
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,159
the world

804
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:05,679
the un i've long said is as pathetic or

805
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:07,840
as great as the world is

806
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,880
outside it's a reflection of it as are

807
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:11,279
all the

808
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,919
these big groups the group you know g20

809
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,240
g8

810
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,399
g7 and so forth uh they're not going to

811
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,399
be vastly better because

812
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:19,678
essentially the reform has to begin

813
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,479
within states

814
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,880
and then it's it's sort of the the shine

815
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,080
will

816
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:28,320
will it will sort of grace itself on

817
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,360
the international organizations at the

818
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:34,320
moment uh i think covet has proven

819
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:36,879
what a failure we are as humanity i mean

820
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:38,960
this pandemic this corona virus

821
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:41,360
i mean it's hardly new to us i mean ever

822
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,760
since human beings began to roam the

823
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:43,600
earth

824
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,760
we've had disease and pestilence and

825
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:48,080
then you had the black death and

826
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,679
i mean it's hardly new to us and yet

827
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,240
utterly incapable

828
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:54,000
of creating systems whereby a serious

829
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,240
health outbreak in one country

830
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:58,399
doesn't affect everyone else i mean it's

831
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,880
a terrible indictment of us

832
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:01,918
and i think part of the problem we have

833
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,320
is that our

834
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,519
our belief in the wonderment of

835
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,279
technology

836
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,679
has also made us accept the arrogance

837
00:31:09,279 --> 00:31:13,519
of those who peddle it as as if it's

838
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
going to solve all our problems

839
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,039
the problems actually are human problems

840
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,959
and they must begin

841
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:21,679
with much better quality global

842
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:25,039
leadership because unless we have that

843
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,880
i think we are imperiled and i'm

844
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:28,320
always reminded of the comments that

845
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,919
niels bohr penned

846
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,279
to fdr to franklin delano roosevelt in

847
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,279
1944

848
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,120
when he said yes the atomic bomb could

849
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:38,240
give you some temporary military

850
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:41,279
advantage and

851
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,399
a very brutal war but it will be

852
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,279
a perpetual menace to human society and

853
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:49,518
i fear this is now where technology is

854
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,760
it's going to be a perpetual menace but

855
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,559
there is a positive note i mean when i

856
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,720
look at the amazing work of max french

857
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,320
and we had the decision handed down by

858
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,799
the european court of justice the other

859
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
day

860
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:05,440
i mean just to me in in respect of

861
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,000
the ill-named privacy shield uh policy

862
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,200
i mean it's amazing what one activist

863
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,159
can do and when with

864
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,720

00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,200
sort of the state of where we're at

900
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,120
after finishing up

901
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:33,600
five days of rights con and i'm glad

902
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,039
that marwah used such beautiful words to

903
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,799

904
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,480
you know radical imagination that's been

905
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:40,240
demonstrated at rights con

906
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:42,320
and that the speakers really commented

907
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,519
on the state of where we're at and what

908
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,600
needs to happen

909
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,880
and you know every year i think we're

910
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:48,959

911
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:50,640

and what we've achieved here was an

917
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:01,519
undertaking that wouldn't have been

918
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:03,039
possible without the help of many many

919
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,720

920
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,600

us

940
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,639
rethink what this looks like in an

941
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:44,800
online context so

942
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,480
big thank you to ariana shannon nick

943
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
each and every technical moderator that

944
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,320
helped us in our sessions and helped

945
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:52,719
us understand how to translate all of

946
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,040
this online

947
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:56,959
and you know lastly but surely not least

948
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,200
i want to thank all of our sponsors who

949
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,760
enabled this conversation to happen

950
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,078
who joined us in a largely untested

951
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,359
unknown online platform

952
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:07,200
and we look forward to continuing to

953
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,560
working with all of you into

954
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,839
2021 and so i think a big question that

955
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,680
remains

956
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,839
that i'm sure many of you are asking is

957
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,359
what's

958
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,960
and well first the rightscon team and

959
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:19,359
the accessnow team is going to take some

960
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,680
time

961
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:22,799
to rest before we re-emerge for the next

962
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,560
cycle

963
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,560
but in the short term a lot of you have

964
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,160
been asking about the platform about

965
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,520
what happens to it and we have some

966
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:31,200
really great news

967
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,280
and that the conversation won't finish

968
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:35,200
after we close up

969
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:36,720
closing ceremonies you'll be able to

970
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,399
continue to watch and revisit the

971
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:39,598
content hosted on the platform for the

972
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,280
next little while

973
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:43,040
you know that was created by all of you

974
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,079
for all of you and we will continue to

975
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,560
make it accessible

976
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:47,680
and think about the ways in which we can

977
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,920
you know showcase those

978
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,839
important conversations and continue to

979
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,000
build off of them

980
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,680
next we are looking forward to talking

981
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:57,200
to you all about what we've achieved

982
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:58,879
here so there's you know moments to

983
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,799
celebrate our successes

984
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,240
document the outcomes and learn about

985
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,920
what worked and didn't work

986
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:06,399
um so that we can adapt to make next

987
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:08,560
year's summit even better

988
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,440
and you know whether we'll be able to

989
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,960
meet in person

990
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,960
is something that remains to be

991
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,079
determined as the current context

992
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,920
evolves

993
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:17,200
but i think you know we can all feel

994
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:19,440
confident in the ways this online

995
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,598
experience has demonstrated

996
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,920
the potential and opportunity that we

997
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,200
have in creating the spaces to discuss

998
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:29,440
and protect and extend our human rights

999
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,960
and so i think that there's one you know

1000
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:32,240
thing right now that is important for

1001
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,760
all of you to know

1002
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,879
which is that the rights con community

1003
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,359
will come together again in 2021

1004
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:40,720
so on behalf on behalf of all of us

1005
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,680
thank you for coming on this journey

1006
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,759
