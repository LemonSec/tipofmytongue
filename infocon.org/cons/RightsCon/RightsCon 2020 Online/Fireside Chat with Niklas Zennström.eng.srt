9
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,758
zenstrom uh who most people know as

10
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,399
the co-founder and ceo of skype and who

11
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,000
is now

12
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:55,840
the ceo of atomico um

13
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,840
one of europe's leading pc firms

14
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,200
great to be here holiday

15
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,158
so let's dive uh immediately in

16
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
the reason why actually we're speaking

17
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,800
through

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,080
screens and why we're having writecon

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,120
online this year

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,959
is a response to covid19 and and the

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,160
pandemic that went

22
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,959
the pandemic so ourselves at acts now

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,280
we had to adopt new tools and and be

24
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,760
innovative and find technologies

25
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,560
that would be suitable for for an online

26
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,879
summit

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,480
and we're not the only ones who had to

28
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,079
seek solutions and

29
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,160
technical solutions um as a response to

30
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,120
covet 19 around the world

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,680
a lot of government have tried to adopt

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,760
various tools and various apps

33
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,680
especially tracking apps as a response

34
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,160
to the pandemic to do

35
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,519
event prevention measures but also

36
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,560
immediate response

37
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,120
to to the pandemic i was wondering for

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,200
you

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,640
as you know you invest in lots of

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,040
companies what has been

41
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,958
your immediate response to covet 19

42
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:08,799
so um as an investment firm what we did

43
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,239
when when uh the pandemic hit us in

44
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:15,519
so we're based in the uk we uh

45
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,280
first of all we locked down and uh

46
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,760
started to work from home two weeks

47
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:22,800
before the lockdown and

48
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,280
i think for us and and for a lot of

49
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,360
other

50
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,120
actually most tech companies and other

51
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,680
investment firms i've been speaking to

52
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,080
that switch to working from remotely was

53
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:35,760
so seamless and remarkably seamless

54
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,959
and so our first focus was safety of our

55
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,359
team

56
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,159
um to make sure everyone was safe it

57
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,680
could work from

58
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:45,120
from home secondly uh was our portfolio

59
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,799
companies

60
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,319
and we engage with all our portfolio

61
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:51,760
companies and i think that

62
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,679
we probably had more board meetings in

63
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:57,920
three months than we had in three years

64
00:03:53,680 --> 00:04:01,439
and we advised all our companies to

65
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,040
do whatever they could to also to have

66
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,400
this kind of three-stage approach to

67
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,640
focus first on the team

68
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,159
secondly on their business and third

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:12,480
also what they can participate

70
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,840
in society to help combat this this this

71
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,000
pandemic so um it was very much about

72
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,320
these companies to help them to preserve

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,320
cash to extend their runway because

74
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:24,000
these companies are typically non

75
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,680
still burning money they're not

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,199
profitable because they're early stage

77
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,199
growth companies so

78
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,520
they're dependent on raising new funds

79
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,360
and and when the market is

80
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,198
turning down investors are usually

81
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,919
shying away so it's critical for the

82
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
survival of

83
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,440
these tech companies these startup

84
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,840
companies we're not talking about the

85
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,520
big

86
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,440
big tech giants we're talking about

87
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,560
young startup companies

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,280
to preserve their cash so they can uh

89
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,639
last longer without raising more capital

90
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,239
so that was the first thing

91
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,919
we did with them and and ourselves and

92
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,080
and then the third thing what we did was

93
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,880
also both as a firm but also through our

94
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,280
companies

95
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,360
start to think how can we engage in the

96
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,239
society to combat

97
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,600
the um the crisis situation that we were

98
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
all finding ourselves in

99
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:12,080
and and uh you know part of that is of

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,159
course is used to

101
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,440
biggest possible extent possible to work

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,199
remotely to

103
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,199
help to stop the spread of iron spread

104
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,800
uh which we did and the other one was

105
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:24,400
like thinking through how can we then

106
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
proactively work

107
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,719
what are the companies that we have

108
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:33,039
investments in that can actually help

109
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,680
to do positive things that to combat

110
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:35,680
the crisis

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,440
thank you so did you notice uh a spike

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,719
in interest and like have you been

113
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,600
approached by

114
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,160
more companies that had maybe like a

115
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,080
focus

116
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,199
on on fighting the pandemic or did you

117
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,359
yourself

118
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:53,039
uh looked into the companies you were

119
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,680
already investing in

120
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,560
um and see what were the solutions

121
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,560
available there

122
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:00,560
yeah absolutely two things there one was

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,199
that we certainly

124
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,720
most what we did was work with our

125
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,759
companies that we are investors in so we

126
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,199
typically are on the board of these

127
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,199
companies we are not

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:11,039
minority we are minority investors we

129
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,680
cannot tell them what to do we can only

130
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,560
advise

131
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,919
and encourage them so that's what we did

132
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,240
and a few of our companies

133
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,080
actually did a lot of things that are

134
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,360
great that we were very proud of and

135
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,159
as an example accurx which is a company

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,520
in the uk

137
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:30,080
which are now in um

138
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
i think majority or almost a majority of

139
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,080
all uh gp practices

140
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
providing messaging service they quickly

141
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,159
launched

142
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,240
a telehealth video consultation service

143
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,400
so that it enabled gp practices in the

144
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,080
uk to do

145
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,479
remote consultation obviously this was

146
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,280
not

147
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,479
for primarily for covet but i said one

148
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:53,039
of the

149
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,800
challenges that healthcare system had

150
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,440
when they had to focus on covid as

151
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,880
normal health practice primary practice

152
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,800
and other practices

153
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:04,080
had a setback so providing telehealth

154
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,720
was a great thing another example was

155
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,840
a farm drop is not a company in the uk

156
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:10,880
which is providing

157
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,080
a marketplace enabling consumers to buy

158
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:18,159
produce food from local producers from

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,159
local farmers local fishermen local

160
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,960
bakers and so forth and when we had the

161
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:26,160
lockdown

162
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:28,638
and supermarkets had empty shelves it

163
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,360
really proved out that the global supply

164
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,880
chain was

165
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,639
for food was in a bit stressed out but

166
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,560
farm drop really could really really

167
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,919
increase the capacity at the same time

168
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:40,319
provide food

169
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,919
for for people in the uk or primarily

170
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,400
london i must say

171
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,960
but also also provide a livelihood for

172
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,159
those

173
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,878
um farmers who could continue to provide

174
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,240
even more

175
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,599
uh food um another example

176
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,639
is um scout bay which is a

177
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,520
company that is um

178
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,039
helping big enterprises with managing

179
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,840
their supply chain

180
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,120
and they actually kind of did a lot of

181
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,119
product innovation

182
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:14,160
to help to provide a global

183
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,039
database for for companies to to find

184
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,720
other survival suppliers obviously the

185
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,080
whole supply chain was a bit

186
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:24,560
challenged and another one is not a

187
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,318
health company and sock talk in new york

188
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,199
which is a marketplace helping people to

189
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,680
find doctors

190
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,960
they also switched on telehealth and had

191
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:34,399
a huge spike

192
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,079
in in into telehealth practices so so

193
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
that's kind of the primary things we did

194
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,880
with our portfolio companies the other

195
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,959
thing that we saw

196
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,039
was that and and not only us but all i

197
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:46,880
guess all tech investors saw that

198
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:49,120
there's you know i think the first

199
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,360
kind of assumption when when we're

200
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,680
entering this new situation and of

201
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,279
course it's also becoming a

202
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,000
demand is is in in general uh decreasing

203
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,839
but

204
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,640
what happened was that there was a huge

205
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,920
shift to digitalization and to

206
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:07,600
online both from enterprises and from

207
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,360
consumers so there was a lot of

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:11,519
companies which are benefiting from that

209
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:13,440
and i'm sure

210
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,720
most people have seen you know now

211
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,560
they're certainly used to

212
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,399
become you know something like zoom that

213
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,000
maybe not so many people used before but

214
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,720
that's a company which is a good example

215
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,680
of a huge beneficiary of

216
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,279
of the this kind of pandemic and the

217
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:29,760
lockdown so there is

218
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:32,320
actually for investors specifically for

219
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,319
venture investors like ourselves this

220
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,080
actually represents a huge opportunity

221
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,519
to invest in companies that

222
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,720
are accelerating kind of online

223
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,279
and and remote working and and also

224
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,720
remote kind of e-commerce and other

225
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,200
other ways to kind of communicate

226
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,440
remotely so so those are things that are

227
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,560
being on the kind of i would say kind of

228
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
the silver lining

229
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:55,439
for someone like us

230
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:00,399
yes connectivity is a big theme this

231
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:03,040
year at reichskone especially access to

232
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,480
to the internet um it's really

233
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,519
interesting some of the examples that

234
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,240
you brought in

235
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,240
um are direct i would say collaboration

236
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,800
or partnerships between

237
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,680
private companies developing uh specific

238
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,279
tools

239
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:20,000
um and governments uh in this case like

240
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,920
health ministries or or the the branch

241
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,399
of government responsible for

242
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,199
for health and access to health care i

243
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:28,000
was wondering

244
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,240
because so many things uh happen in a

245
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:32,079
really accelerated way as you said and

246
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,120
and we rushed sometimes to some

247
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,439
solutions

248
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,880
some of them with little oversight uh

249
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:39,200
when it came to

250
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,200
respect for privacy and and compliance

251
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:44,240
with other human rights

252
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,160
what really can people do and and in

253
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,959
response to to those partnerships

254
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,480
between

255
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:52,880
companies and governments and yourself

256
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:55,519
you said like you you're often like a

257
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,040
a minority sharehold stakeholder in

258
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,760
those companies but is there

259
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,920
a way for you to to influence or what is

260
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,959
your approach when it comes to

261
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:06,880
ensuring um that privacy and other

262
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,560
rights are respected

263
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,399
in those in those kind of government

264
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:13,119
company partnerships

265
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
yeah yeah so i you know so think about

266
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,240
that question i think it's

267
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,680
it's actually not a big difference

268
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:22,000
whether a service is provided

269
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:23,120
for through you know through governments

270
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,160
or um

271
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,560
to to end users or directly

272
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,360
from the company itself the tech company

273
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,399
itself

274
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:35,920
i think that we all need to ensure

275
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,120
that privacy is respected

276
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:40,560
and and um see if you think about

277
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,480
if you think about the tech company that

278
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,359
normally the provide the services

279
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
directly to

280
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
to the consumers we need to ensure that

281
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,200
as a society we have

282
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,000
uh a system in place to keep check on on

283
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,760
these companies

284
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,079
that that the rights of

285
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,519
citizens are protected and i think that

286
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,839
is exactly the same that need

287
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,040
to apply whether that service is

288
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,720
provided

289
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:10,079
through a government procurement and uh

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,000
and you know and paid for by

291
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:14,479
taxpayers money so i don't think that

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,760
there needs should be a separate

293
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,399
system in place i think that we all have

294
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:19,920
responsibilities

295
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,000
whether we have we certainly think that

296
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,279
we have a responsibility as an investor

297
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,360
and as as a usually we are board members

298
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,800
of these companies to ensure

299
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:33,839
that these companies are considering uh

300
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:39,680
privacy and other kind of rights for for

301
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,680
its end users and other stakeholders

302
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,959
you know that's right and and when we

303
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,479
see actually in the

304
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:49,518
categories of of most used apps uh

305
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,839
in response of the pandemic one of the

306
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,760
most

307
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,000
um the most popular

308
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,680
applications that were used were mostly

309
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,079
voice and video chat

310
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,519
so you created skype what was your

311
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:03,279
reaction when you saw

312
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:06,720
all of this happening and did you think

313
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,120
that the sector was ready yeah i mean

314
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:10,639
it's

315
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,600
it's it's just that um

316
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,320
when we when we launched skype a long

317
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:21,200
time ago now in in

318
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:24,560
2003 and we launched a video in in

319
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,399
early 2004 i think we didn't know if if

320
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,079
that was too early for video but it

321
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,880
turns out that it was a great timing for

322
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,760
video and

323
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:33,120
we certainly enjoyed a lot of success

324
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,880
and we had

325
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
you know hundreds of millions of people

326
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
using skype for video calling all around

327
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
the world

328
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,959
and it really connected people and and

329
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,160
brought people together so that's

330
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:44,560
something that

331
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,709
i'm certainly very kind of proud of and

332
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:48,800
what we have seen now is used to kind of

333
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:52,880
[Music]

334
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:55,839
the next wave of demand for for uh

335
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,639
for for video and where i would say

336
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,959
before

337
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:01,040
the lockdown the video was used maybe

338
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,079
more as an alternative

339
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,719
so as an alternative way to to meet the

340
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:06,800
where the

341
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,560
people's primary way to meet was always

342
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:11,839
in person and we got on an

343
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:12,800
airplane or we drew a car we were stuck

344
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,240
in traffic

345
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,040
and we were in public uh subways and

346
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,320
buses and

347
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:23,760
and whatsoever and wasted both

348
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,240
time and and

349
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,680
and carbon emission to meet what

350
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,800
happened in the lockdown was that there

351
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,359
was a flip

352
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,319
where the primary way to meet is the via

353
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,720
video

354
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,600
and now it becomes a very rare thing to

355
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,800
meet

356
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,720
in person in real life so that's what

357
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:44,240
has kind of really kind of

358
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,399
made a big big step change but

359
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,320
we wouldn't be able to do this if the

360
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:52,160
infrastructure was not ready for it

361
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:55,600
and you know whether you're using zoom

362
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,839
meet hangout

363
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:03,120
teams or skype or any other facetime

364
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,560
whatsapp video etc

365
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,320
none of these would work if if video was

366
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,518
not something that was very very popular

367
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,839
video communication was something that

368
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:12,800
was

369
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,120
very popular for you know 10-15 years

370
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,279
and

371
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,880
it wouldn't work if the internet wasn't

372
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:19,600
built out with this

373
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,360
massive infrastructure and i think

374
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,839
certainly i was surprised and many

375
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,680
others

376
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,160
were surprised that that they kind of

377
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,599
last mile of the internet didn't kind of

378
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,639
break down in terms of

379
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:35,360
of congestion because there were so many

380
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:38,240
people sitting at home doing video calls

381
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
so in a way we're very fortunate you

382
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,000
know

383
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,479
it's like if this pandemic would have

384
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:45,440
happened 15 years earlier

385
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,720
we would struggle as a world economy

386
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,399
because we didn't have the cloud

387
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,920
remote working wouldn't really work at

388
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:51,600
all and

389
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,959
you know the capacity of a video calls

390
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,480
would not be sufficient

391
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
so so now we have such a great

392
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,399
infrastructure so that

393
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:00,000
it's just and the other thing that most

394
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,440
of us are finding out that is so much

395
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,800
more efficient

396
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,839
um and we can work from where we want to

397
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:08,160
work

398
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,880
um and this is more efficient to have

399
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,639
video meetings but i would also say that

400
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,240
the other thing that at least i realized

401
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,360
that i value

402
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,320
maybe more in-person meetings

403
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,440
uh uh to get together in depth to get to

404
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,040
know people and to

405
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:24,480
you know to to bond and build strong

406
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,800
relationships and i think also when you

407
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
really want to be creative

408
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,319
it's probably nothing is better than

409
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,519
getting together

410
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,519
in in person

411
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,199
so when you talked about um

412
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,959
you know like the fact that everyone was

413
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,479
moving to two video calls you also

414
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,399
mentioned the demands

415
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,720
and the expectations that people had

416
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,399
when when you turned to those tools

417
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,759
i know that this community is

418
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,199
particularly

419
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:56,480
interested or or one of its um

420
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:59,599
fierce demands is towards encryption

421
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,000
and as privacy advocates like we're

422
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,800
almost

423
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,520
asking sometimes developers to to build

424
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:07,039
tools with encryption by default or

425
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,559
really strong privacy settings by

426
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,000
default

427
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:11,439
i'm not talking about skype i'm talking

428
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,839
also about all of those new tools those

429
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:14,240
that

430
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,000
are new those that that don't exist yet

431
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,079
what are your thoughts towards

432
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,400
you know encryption and and really

433
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,480
strong privacy by default

434
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,000
when you when you debate yeah for sure

435
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,200
um i think it's a really really

436
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,440
important question and

437
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,640
i think the reality with the internet

438
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,120
even from the beginning

439
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,400
when i started you know early on in my

440
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:39,439
career and i started

441
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:41,919
you know the internet was always an

442
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:43,600
insecure network you have to assume that

443
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,080
whatever you're transmitting on the

444
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,959
internet is available for anyone

445
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,000
to tap into whether that is a government

446
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,280
or a hacker

447
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:55,120
or use you know whoever is having you

448
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,918
know downloading some tools and sniffing

449
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:59,840
your wi-fi network

450
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,600
and in the early days of the internet

451
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,320
there was a big criticism

452
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,600
uh from the telecom industry that it was

453
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,559
an uncontrollable

454
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,559
network that that was very anarchic

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,678
there was no governance

456
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:15,039
and always the way from the early on the

457
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:18,640
way to provide

458
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:21,280
privacy was end-to-end encryption

459
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:23,280
and that is still the way to provide

460
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:26,720
privacy today is end-to-end encryption

461
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,160
so anyone who wants to stay

462
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:32,960
private and want to have private

463
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,520
conversations or private messages

464
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
without

465
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:40,320
anyone eavesdropping on it needs to have

466
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,240
strong end-to-end encryption

467
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,840
and that's just very very fundamental

468
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:45,440
thing so that

469
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,760
if you don't have anton encryption you

470
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:50,240
just gonna have to assume that

471
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,320
someone is have the ability and if they

472
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,880
have that ability to do probably will

473
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:55,360
potentially listen into you the thing

474
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:59,440
that has

475
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:01,918
changed um over the last 10 years or so

476
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,919
was that

477
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,360
in the old days was maybe that it was

478
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:09,039
maybe someone wanted to tap into you

479
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,399
because they wanted to

480
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,640
they were interested in what you were

481
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,480
saying because actually just to kind of

482
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,600
actually eavesdrop today

483
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:19,280
it's been a commercial benefit to tap

484
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:22,639
into

485
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:23,678
where you are who you are what interests

486
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,720
you have

487
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,280
you know how you feel so there's a huge

488
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:31,679
industry today advertisement industry

489
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,559
that is benefiting from collecting

490
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
information

491
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,720
about you as an individual and that's

492
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,399
the big difference from

493
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,080
from in the old days i think we just

494
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,360
need to kind of separate these two

495
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,360
different things that when you

496
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,799
think about there's private

497
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,360
communication and

498
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,200
there is an industry that is benefiting

499
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,240
from knowing about you to serve your ads

500
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:53,840
to provide

501
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,840
services to you that you don't pay for

502
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,400
thank you um and actually speaking about

503
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:02,240
like

504
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,520
ads and how we protect ourselves from

505
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
from ads or whether

506
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:06,799
we want ads or we don't want ads and

507
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:09,918
what kind of ads we want

508
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,639
in we're both in europe uh where there

509
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,679
are strong

510
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,039
uh privacy and data protection

511
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:19,360
regulation some detractors to

512
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,799
to this regulation are saying that it's

513
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,639
killing innovation or that it's

514
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:25,280
preventing innovation

515
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:26,320
and recently we at the same time we've

516
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,440
seen

517
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:30,960
backlash from practices in u.s and

518
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,720
chinese tech groups

519
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:35,600
because of their lack of consideration

520
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:37,120
for privacy for data protection and and

521
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,158
human rights in general

522
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:40,719
but also for for diversity do you think

523
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:43,600
that

524
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,720
first of all is this is this um i want

525
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,840
to call it a myth

526
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,159
that that protecting human rights

527
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,039
prevents uh

528
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,440
innovation so is this for you i mean you

529
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,320
you

530
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:55,120
you innovated you founded skype uh you

531
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,720
invest in

532
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:01,360
in very ambitious programs and projects

533
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:03,679
so do you think that there is a real

534
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,039
antagonism between innovation and human

535
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,400
rights

536
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,520
yeah i think it's a very important

537
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,600
question and it's very easy to say

538
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
to say to make that blanket statement

539
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,280
that that all these privacy laws whether

540
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:20,320
there's gdpr

541
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:22,320
or or others that are uh

542
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,520
stifling innovation and use that as a

543
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,200
blanket statement

544
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,639
for doing whatever you want to do as a

545
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:30,000
company

546
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,600
we um i think because

547
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,960
if if that's the kind of approach that

548
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,639
we have i think we're in very very

549
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,559
dangerous territory

550
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,919
and i think that's not okay um we did a

551
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,440
survey

552
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,360
so we issued this report state of

553
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:47,200
european tech

554
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:50,719
each year and of each year and

555
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,610
we did a survey a year and a half ago

556
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,720
among founders in

557
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,678
[Music]

558
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,080
technology companies in europe we asked

559
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:01,200
them

560
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:02,240
if they thought that gdpr was hindering

561
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:05,039
them

562
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,400
to pursue their business objectives and

563
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,200
the other thing we asked them was that

564
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,480
if they thought that

565
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,280
gdpr was a good thing for society

566
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,720
and there were more people who responded

567
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,440
that

568
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:19,520
they thought that g and p founders so

569
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,159
leaders of company ceos who responded

570
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,639
that

571
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
they think that gdpr is a positive thing

572
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,159
is

573
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,000
for society there were more people who

574
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,320
all suggested that than the

575
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,360
peop ceos who answered that it was

576
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,320
stifling their

577
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:35,120
uh innovation or their progress for

578
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:38,720
their businesses

579
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,199
so it's very very rare

580
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,000
that we hear from any company when we

581
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,919
invest and we

582
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,360
work with these companies that they say

583
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:48,559
that

584
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,918
you know privacy is

585
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,120
privacy regulation is is um stifling

586
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:55,120
what they do

587
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,399
in terms of progressing their business

588
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,000
now

589
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:03,919
i would say when we think about

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:06,799
um i would say that the

591
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:08,960
the other point i would say here is that

592
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:12,400
when we come to big data

593
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,520
and we talk think about uh

594
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,440
ai and machine learning there's a lot of

595
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:21,280
amazing um solutions that can provide it

596
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,200
and that will be provided by machine

597
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:25,200
learning and artificial intelligence i

598
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,640
was thinking specifically

599
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,679
in healthcare in preventing you know in

600
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,159
in producing

601
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:34,480
treatments for diseases one of our

602
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,120
companies

603
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:39,200
helix is using machine learning to find

604
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:41,120
treatments to rare diseases which are

605
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,039
have two small patients group for big

606
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:46,959
pharma to provide

607
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,679
solutions for now because of

608
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,039
privacy laws in terms of how much

609
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:55,440
companies can access

610
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,760
health data that is being protected by

611
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,960
privacy laws i think there there is

612
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:02,960
something to be done

613
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:06,640
in terms of making that data available

614
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,760
in a way that is completely protecting

615
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,480
individuals privacy so i think there is

616
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,559
something to be

617
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,400
done there but i think it's really

618
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:16,000
important when we whatever we do

619
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:19,039
is that we make sure we're protecting

620
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:21,279
people's privacy and and

621
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:22,960
i would say also that if you take that

622
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:23,840
other kind of the first statement like

623
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,919
well if there's no

624
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,840
regulations we have we can access

625
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,480
whatever data we have then

626
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,240
then we're going to be um have a

627
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,480
competitive advantage now

628
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,360
china is going to win that game because

629
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,760
they

630
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:42,000
they have um a different

631
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,799
set of rules around this and they also

632
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,080
have a huge

633
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,879
database of people i think that's the

634
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,000
game that i don't know if founders

635
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,000
certainly in europe

636
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,159
really want to play and i think that

637
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,159
taking the high road here and saying

638
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:59,120
that whatever companies are being being

639
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:02,400
built

640
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:06,000
are there to put you know to to

641
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,520
honor um data privacy and human rights

642
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,200
i think those are the companies that

643
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:11,039
will be built in europe and i think

644
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:12,960
europe will take a leading role in those

645
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:15,039
kind of companies because

646
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,320
our heritage how we know how we think

647
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,080
about

648
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,918
privacy how we think about respecting

649
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,559
human rights i think we have

650
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,000
a leadership role there but i also think

651
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,320
that

652
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,799
i'm certain about that the companies

653
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,918
that are successful specifically in tech

654
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:32,960
are the ones that can

655
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:36,400
attract and recruit the best talent

656
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,799
and studies shows that

657
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,640
talent in tech wants to work for

658
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:43,600
companies which are ethical

659
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,640
and which have an ethical approach so i

660
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,719
think that if you

661
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,320
taking like an unethical approach to

662
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,760
this and say like well we're not going

663
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,760
to respect privacy you're not going to

664
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,279
be able to

665
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:56,799
attract the best talents in in volumes

666
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,200
so i think it's a competitive advantage

667
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:02,000
i also think that customers

668
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,000
are more and more

669
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,960
starting to think about these these

670
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:12,400
issues as well so companies which are

671
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:15,520
respecting privacy will eventually be

672
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:16,559
more attractive to customers and

673
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,639
consumer

674
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:19,918
today that's not the case today

675
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:23,039
convenience

676
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:25,120
wins over over our or our concerns

677
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,200
and and and we do because it's so

678
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:31,039
difficult today

679
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,679
to use operate online if you want to use

680
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:34,720
products that fully are respecting you

681
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:36,480
know

682
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,840
privacy rather than thinking of you as

683
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,840
an individual as a product

684
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,000
yes i think the the human rights

685
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,320
advocate in me uh

686
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:48,720
jumped a bit when i heard you say uh

687
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,360
china is gonna win this game

688
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,640
but uh but i think you're right we we

689
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:54,879
see that increasingly

690
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,080
companies have to listen to to the

691
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,559
people that are using

692
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,678
uh their products and their tools and

693
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,720
we've seen in europe

694
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:05,440
already how the demands have have

695
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:06,640
um have increased and and especially

696
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:08,960
actually like during

697
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:10,640
coved if we make a comparison between

698
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:13,840
the countries that have adopted

699
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,720
um tracking apps for example for for

700
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,039
kovid

701
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:18,960
the the most popular apps have been the

702
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:19,440
ones that were privacy respecting when

703
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:22,960
they

704
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,240
when they had also been in ireland um

705
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:29,679
um some education and some dialogue

706
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:31,679
about what what the app would do and

707
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,200
would not be able to do as opposed to

708
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:35,679
in other countries i know that in france

709
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,919
for example the the app was a

710
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,120
disaster and and the take-up was was

711
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,320
really low

712
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,279
so hopefully i want to remain uh hopeful

713
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,200
that

714
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,960
uh strong privacy regimes and regulation

715
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,840
can offer

716
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,799
solutions and that also the more that

717
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,879
people will be

718
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:56,799
familiar and used to to having these

719
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,679
rights protected and respected by

720
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:58,799
companies

721
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:02,080
the more companies will have an

722
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,760
incentive to to apply them

723
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,279
i know that a lot of people in in the

724
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,039
chat have some

725
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,039
questions there is one more question

726
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,960
that i could not not ask you

727
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,399
uh today and then i will follow up with

728
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:14,960
some uh

729
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:17,120
people's questions is because already

730
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:19,919
since the the beginning of writecon

731
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,918
uh we've heard of criticism of the the

732
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:23,840
tax role in reproducing

733
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,559
racist and discriminatory power

734
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:29,600
structures in the digital age

735
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:32,240
and in in a way like the vc community

736
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,199
we could say has failed to fund and to

737
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,520
support

738
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,440
non-male and and monitoring or

739
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:39,679
underrepresented founders

740
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,640
although i think prominent ferns have

741
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:43,039
scrambled uh

742
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,000
over the last couple of months i know

743
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:47,279
that um

744
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,000
this is not a new issue um to atomico

745
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:50,080
because you

746
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,440
you have your own diversity policy i

747
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,199
just wanted to ask you

748
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,039
a bit more like what are your thoughts

749
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,640
with regards to

750
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,039
these discussions and what are your

751
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,240
steps towards a more equitable

752
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,120
funding environment yeah yes no it's a

753
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,440
huge problem

754
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,520
and and it's been a huge problem for a

755
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,640
very long time

756
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:13,840
and it's something that the

757
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,039
industry is starting to wake up to um

758
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:19,678
and it started with

759
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,399
diversity and inclusion with regards to

760
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,320
gender

761
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,399
with the metoo movement when the tech

762
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,360
industry started to look

763
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,520
at and we certainly didn't say like we

764
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,120
haven't done a good job

765
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,320
um there are most

766
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,760
founders are white males who gone to

767
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:43,279
like good universities um

768
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:45,360
there's there's a clear uh biased

769
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,320
two words yeah it was man and two as a

770
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:51,039
white man

771
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:53,439
which is not okay at all and

772
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:54,080
i think from so we just need to

773
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,120
acknowledge

774
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,120
as an as an industry we we have not done

775
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,879
a great job at all

776
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,039
and and but that's not the reason to

777
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:06,840
continue to not do a good job

778
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:08,480
we as a firm we we kind of woke up to

779
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,120
this

780
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,760
you know with the me too movement and i

781
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,320
always

782
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:15,360
thought and i know that we all of us in

783
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:18,399
our team

784
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,879
are very open-minded growth mindsets and

785
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,399
trying not not at all to have any kind

786
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:25,440
of biases

787
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,639
but by use continuing the practice that

788
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:30,799
everyone has done

789
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:34,000
you use complete you you're repeating

790
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:36,639
an ecosystem which is being built by

791
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:38,159
primarily by white men who went to good

792
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:43,039
universities

793
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:45,200
so when we founded skype in 2006

794
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,960
the kind of the founding kind of thesis

795
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,240
that we had was that great companies

796
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,960
will come from

797
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,320
everywhere and when we thought about

798
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:55,600
that then it was

799
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:56,639
not that great tech companies does not

800
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,480
have to come

801
00:30:56,640 --> 00:31:01,760
only from silicon valley because back

802
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,519
then in 2006 that was the case

803
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:05,919
and we thought we proved to some extent

804
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,720
that that you can build an international

805
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:09,440
company from europe with skype and and

806
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
we had a

807
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,840
conviction that founders are talented

808
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:16,399
people

809
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,519
and talented people just like talented

810
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,039
musicians

811
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,240
painters artists poets writers athletes

812
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:27,440
they are born around the world

813
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:30,720
and they're born in

814
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,480
from all different ethical ethnical

815
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,559
backgrounds they're born in all

816
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,159
different social backgrounds they're

817
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,559
born in all different genders

818
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:41,760
so what we didn't think about is that

819
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,879
great companies can come up from

820
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,840
everywhere we thought about that

821
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,559
initially used as

822
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:47,918
geography but now it's realizing that's

823
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,158
just need to be extended

824
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,000
to any kind of group of founders

825
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:55,679
and when we think about it that way

826
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,240
we're realizing that wow there's such a

827
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:59,279
big

828
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:00,559
universe of talent and founders that we

829
00:31:59,279 --> 00:32:04,159
haven't really done a good job

830
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:06,320
tapping into so we kind of

831
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
when we thought about this more and more

832
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:09,678
not only did we realize that

833
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,519
it's just the right thing to make sure

834
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:14,720
you're you have

835
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,399
a strong policy and a plan

836
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:18,880
to to make your firm and your

837
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:20,639
investments more diverse

838
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
and and be more inclusive it's actually

839
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:24,720
really good business because

840
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,880
a few things is that we know that from

841
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,480
studies that diverse teams

842
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,080
make better decisions and as an

843
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,039
investment firm it's all about making

844
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:35,360
investment decisions and if we were all

845
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,640
all of us who look at investments if we

846
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,559
were all very similar

847
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,320
we would lose many perspectives so

848
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,200
having people from different

849
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,559
ethical backgrounds and of course also

850
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,519
different genders

851
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,600
will make us better investors studies

852
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,720
numerous studies also showing that

853
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:55,760
diverse group of teams

854
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,240
are performing better as companies

855
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,840
so it's just much better business to to

856
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,039
really really think through

857
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,720
diversity and inclusion so

858
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,360
we've been you know for a few years we

859
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,440
were much more focused on on gender and

860
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,600
we set objectives for ourselves

861
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,440
both in our team to make sure that we

862
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,240
have a team

863
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:17,360
that is diverse and today we have 50 of

864
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,159
our investment team is

865
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:21,439
is females and 50 men so we've come a

866
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,840
long way there

867
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,600
but i think on on ethical

868
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,760
background we're not there yet that's

869
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,240
that's kind of the other things that we

870
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,600
we are have to make an effort on so what

871
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:34,960
we can do as an investment for we can

872
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:38,000
make sure that our team

873
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:38,480
is more diverse and we can also make

874
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,480
sure

875
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,840
that when we are investing in companies

876
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:44,000
we really think through

877
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,199
we have diversity and inclusion as a

878
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,279
parameter when we're looking at

879
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:49,200
companies and also kind of looking at

880
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:50,880
are these founders really taking diverse

881
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,279
and inclusion series

882
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:55,200
and then we can work with our companies

883
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:56,320
portfolio companies also for them very

884
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,840
early on

885
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,519
to set you know diversity and inclusion

886
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,879
policies and strategies in place and

887
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:05,039
then give them toolkits

888
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,640
to to make that happen and the third

889
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:09,679
thing we can do is to engage

890
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,440
with the grassroots stages of of the

891
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,879
of the ecosystem so what we're doing now

892
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:16,079
we're working with a few

893
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:19,679
grassroots organizations in in europe

894
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,399
which are helping uh founders from

895
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:23,520
different backgrounds to to learn and to

896
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,560
encourage them how to

897
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:27,040
to to build companies this is something

898
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:30,078
that

899
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:31,520
it's not going to be a flip over over

900
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:33,679
you know over a day it's going to take

901
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,159
some time to to get there but

902
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:37,200
it's it's uh i'm very encouraged to see

903
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,560
like we're not like

904
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:40,480
you know i talk about what we can what

905
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:42,639
we do but i see so many other firms and

906
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,760
again i think this is really where the

907
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,119
european firms

908
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,960
are having a step ahead compared to

909
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:50,960
our peers and other other geographers

910
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,040
yeah so we just need to keep banging

911
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:56,960
that actually

912
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
an equitable environment is better for

913
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:01,040
business

914
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,279
and and if you want to an important

915
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,480
return for your money you need you need

916
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:06,480
to take

917
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,839
those steps that that you have mentioned

918
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,040
to to pro

919
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,160
not just to promote but actually uh

920
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:17,279
work the work the work in terms of

921
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:20,240
um diversity inclusion

922
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:21,920
i promised that we would uh answer some

923
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:24,560
of the questions that have been

924
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,520
put forth in the in the chat so i'm just

925
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:28,240
going to read to you

926
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,880
one question which refers to our our

927
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,598
previous

928
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,920
uh question about end-to-end encryption

929
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,200
uh

930
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:36,160
and going a bit deeper so someone is

931
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,640
asking

932
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,920
do you we should be mandating open

933
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:42,480
source and end-to-end

934
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,320
encryption for video software it seems

935
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,160
like gtc is the only solution that does

936
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,960
group video and meets those criteria

937
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,040
today

938
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,200
if not how can users trust that the

939
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:52,000
company is not snooping for corporate

940
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,480
benefit

941
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,320
or for the government of the trusted

942
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,520
sellers

943
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,320
yeah i think the reality is that if you

944
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,839
want to be

945
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:06,320
certain that something is encrypted

946
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:07,599
end-to-end you need to have at least

947
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,200
that the encryption

948
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:15,599
part of that service to be open source

949
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,640
alternatively being peer reviewed by

950
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:22,240
a panel of of experts who are

951
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,759
trusted but even that is not you know

952
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:27,759
i would say it's not as secure as having

953
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,599
that part part uh open source

954
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,400
um so i mean that's that's what i can

955
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,000
say then like

956
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,520
and then the question is like is that

957
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:38,960
something we should mandate or not

958
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,960
i mean it's like i think that

959
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:44,480
um yeah i think that you will um

960
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,839
you know there are you know we have all

961
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:51,118
kind of you know

962
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:52,720
read about you know the discoveries that

963
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,119
snowden did

964
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:00,399
so we know that governments are having

965
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,280
capacity to you know

966
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,040
to you know to listen into what we say

967
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,839
and what we do

968
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,440
and not only through the communication

969
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:11,359
layers but they can probably get into

970
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,920
your computers

971
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:15,598
and so then if you so everything is used

972
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:16,000
as weak as the weakest link right so

973
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:18,000
then

974
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,440
you need to then think through okay what

975
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,520
about your end device what about the

976
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:25,359
operating system

977
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:27,200
and so so so it's not as trivial as

978
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,480
as that but that is used like let's fix

979
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,640
the enter

980
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,960
communication um but i think that

981
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:37,118
you know the reality is like if you want

982
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:40,079
to be

983
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,240
certain that you are that you are safe

984
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:45,359
you need to have kind of open source

985
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,839
you know when we when we created skype

986
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,759
we

987
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:49,279
we i think we're probably we were the

988
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,880
pioneers

989
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,760
of end-to-end encryption in a commercial

990
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:55,760
closed source

991
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,759
communication service and we did that

992
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:02,240
because

993
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,839
because we had to because our

994
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,040
communication went through other it was

995
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:08,160
a peer-to-peer communication

996
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:09,839
so if if if you and i had a

997
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,200
communication it might go through it's

998
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,960
very possible to go through a third

999
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,520
party end user so if you didn't

1000
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:17,040
encrypt that person could use sniff our

1001
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,000
traffic and listening to us so we

1002
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,480
thought it was like

1003
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:21,200
we have to and then of course then you

1004
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,720
have

1005
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,640
government agencies coming to you and

1006
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,598
say well uh

1007
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,879
we need to help you to kind of uh we are

1008
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,160
tapping because there are some

1009
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,040
terrorists or some criminal gangs and

1010
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,279
um and and we couldn't really do

1011
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:40,000
anything about it at the time

1012
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,079
uh because it because of that we had

1013
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:45,440
encrypted service but

1014
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,760
we also know that there was a lot of

1015
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,720
activists out in the field who use skype

1016
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,599
and relied on

1017
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:53,200
on skype to be secure but you know i

1018
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:55,760
know that some people ask me

1019
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:56,560
and i could only give them my word at

1020
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:59,920
the time

1021
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,359
but if if things are open source you

1022
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:04,240
know for sure it is

1023
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,040
it is um peer-reviewed that's i think

1024
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,799
that's kind of

1025
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:09,119
would be if you really want to be safe

1026
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:12,320
then should i be mandated

1027
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:15,040
you know maybe uh it's a good

1028
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:15,680
good good question i think that but it's

1029
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,200
also

1030
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,720
the other thing though is that also that

1031
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:20,160
we also have a choice right there's so

1032
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,919
many different

1033
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:23,440
alternatives out there and there are

1034
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,760
open source

1035
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,680
communication services that you can use

1036
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,480
and they're not as convenient

1037
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,919
as the closed source ones and i think

1038
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,680
that's one of the

1039
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,200
challenges but we do have you know there

1040
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,879
are alternatives and

1041
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,720
and uh and then you think through like

1042
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,839
what what about your browser what about

1043
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,839
operating system and so forth

1044
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,920
i think uh we're really towards the end

1045
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,439
of this

1046
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:55,599
this chat but i i also wanted to ask you

1047
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,520
because yesterday there was this

1048
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,200
very important hearing the us of the

1049
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:06,240
the four big big tech companies and so

1050
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:08,240
i was wondering what were your thoughts

1051
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,479
when it comes to the concentration

1052
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,919
and consolidation of the private sector

1053
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,160
on the internet

1054
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:14,960
and obviously like this this is a bit of

1055
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:17,359
a of a

1056
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,160
biased question coming coming from from

1057
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:21,200
us

1058
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:22,480
but do you think that it is jeopardizing

1059
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:25,520
internet core values

1060
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,760
such as openness freedom and and

1061
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,119
permission less innovation and and

1062
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,160
resilience

1063
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,800
um and as we know i mean the some of the

1064
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,118
tools

1065
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,960
are even growing in in the current

1066
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:39,119
circumstances so

1067
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,240
is this for you like a threat or a deal

1068
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:43,520
paddy to

1069
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,040
to the internet values yeah i think

1070
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:47,200
what's happening is that the rich get

1071
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,319
richer the bigger you are the bigger you

1072
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,560
get you know you have so many

1073
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:52,400
competitive advantages

1074
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:53,759
all those companies have huge advantages

1075
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,119
with regards to data

1076
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,319
and when i was saying maybe apple is

1077
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,520
different because they're actually

1078
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:00,000
making money from

1079
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,440
selling your the charging year you buy a

1080
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:02,720
device from them and you actually pay

1081
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,400
them money

1082
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,560
they don't make money from primarily

1083
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,920
from your data but all the others are

1084
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,960
well amazon you buy things from also but

1085
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,800
i think that it becomes hard

1086
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:17,359
to compete head-to-head with those

1087
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,359
companies

1088
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,160
i think we need to be really careful

1089
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,319
when we say that when we ask

1090
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,839
if we make a statement that that the

1091
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:27,440
fact that there's a much concentration

1092
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,960
that undermines

1093
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:34,240
those fundamental value of openness

1094
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,160
because it's not because there are

1095
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,160
only because that you have these

1096
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,560
platforms that so many people

1097
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:41,839
are using doesn't mean that the

1098
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,799
alternative is not there

1099
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:45,040
you know there are plenty of

1100
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:48,319
alternatives for completely open

1101
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:51,680
services um um

1102
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,839
uh and anyone is free to innovate

1103
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:56,960
you know they and the existence of these

1104
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,839
big defined companies are not

1105
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,800
kind of making it harder and harder to

1106
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:02,799
innovate

1107
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,000
um you know they're also providing a lot

1108
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,119
of great tools

1109
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,119
for for people to use you know

1110
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:14,319
to to innovate it might make it harder

1111
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,680
to compete you know head-to-head

1112
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:17,359
with them because they have so much

1113
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,879
resources and there's so much

1114
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:24,400
advantage with data but i think it's i

1115
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,520
i would think that the the the

1116
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,800
the problem is more of that that

1117
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,119
there are a few companies which you know

1118
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,560
so many people in this planet are using

1119
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:35,599
so when something goes wrong with those

1120
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,279
companies

1121
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:41,920
it has a big impact on on uh

1122
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,720
where their algorithms that they have

1123
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,680
you know this

1124
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,799
but specifically the social networks but

1125
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:49,520
those algorithms

1126
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:51,359
are have too much bias it doesn't have a

1127
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,880
small impact it has a global massive

1128
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:54,880
impact

1129
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,200
but i don't think that um that doesn't

1130
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,560
undermine the fundamental kind of

1131
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,680
values of of the early internet that was

1132
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:03,359
you know where you could have

1133
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,078
permissionless innovation because that

1134
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:06,078
still exists

1135
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,319
thank you niklas i'm afraid we've come

1136
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,240
to the end of

1137
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,160
this that maybe just to to wrap up i

1138
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:18,879
think we've got like a minute or two

1139
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,720
um i know that uh some people have been

1140
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:23,599
asking also about like ai

1141
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:24,959
uh you know technologies and so on but

1142
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:25,440
you're also like you're an innovator

1143
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,480
you're a

1144
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,040
you're a founder you're a funder

1145
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,800
so what should we be excited about like

1146
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,800
what what do you have your eyes uh

1147
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,319
on at the moment and what do you feel

1148
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,760
comfortable sharing with

1149
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,160
in terms of yeah you know yeah

1150
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,880
so i think that you know we we by all

1151
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,640
means we

1152
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:47,599
really need to be worried and we need to

1153
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:49,200
scrutinize what's happening with ai

1154
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:50,880
and and how that can because there's so

1155
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:53,439
much biases

1156
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:54,000
that we're which machine learning are

1157
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:56,560
being used

1158
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,440
because and then you're using data set

1159
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,759
that has bias

1160
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,800
and then that that just automated that

1161
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,440
that bias

1162
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,640
and and and and escalating it so that's

1163
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:06,800
something that we need to be worried

1164
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:08,560
about we need to kind of work on that

1165
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,240
but i would also say that it's not like

1166
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:12,319
ai is ultimately just bad

1167
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:14,560
ai is like it's it's it's the most

1168
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,720
powerful tool

1169
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,799
that we have to our disposal to to

1170
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,399
innovate and the things that i'm

1171
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,720
really excited about if i think about

1172
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,800
the next 10-year cycle

1173
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,240
with technology is that i think that we

1174
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:29,280
will make huge

1175
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:31,839
huge progress in healthcare in in

1176
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,800
in preventing cures and treatments for

1177
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:35,040
diseases

1178
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,400
that we think about that we couldn't do

1179
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,720
today

1180
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,079
um i think that's that's so so that's

1181
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:42,240
something we need to make sure

1182
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,160
that whatever we do here we talked about

1183
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,240
staffing innovation whatever we do

1184
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:48,839
to protect our privacy we also need to

1185
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:50,959
make sure we can

1186
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:52,000
innovate the other thing where i think

1187
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:54,480
where where

1188
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:55,119
technology will have a huge impact is

1189
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:58,560
also

1190
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,440
combating climate and um

1191
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,920
you know there are more and more

1192
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:04,319
companies because that is really

1193
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:06,480
the biggest challenge we have in front

1194
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:07,920
of us

1195
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,359
and there are so many companies now the

1196
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,720
founders are building companies which

1197
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:13,200
are using technology

1198
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:14,799
to to provide products and services in a

1199
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,359
way that is

1200
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:18,000
is is replacing all the old ways to do

1201
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,078
things in

1202
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:22,160
in a climate neutral way so that's

1203
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:24,960
something that i'm also

1204
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,480
very excited about but at the same time

1205
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,880
we really need to work with companies

1206
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:30,800
and ensure that from the early days

1207
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,560
when they're being founded and the early

1208
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:33,760
days of the kind of the formative years

1209
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:36,640
of companies

1210
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:38,640
that these founders are building

1211
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:39,920
cultures and value sets that are

1212
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,240
inclusive that are

1213
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:43,119
respecting fundamental rights and

1214
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,799
thinking through

1215
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:46,640
who are the stakeholders that can be

1216
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,160
affected by our servers

1217
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,279
and what is so encouraging is that

1218
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:54,720
you know now founders young founders are

1219
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:56,319
building companies today they look at

1220
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,160
the big tech companies they don't

1221
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:59,440
today they don't say oh i want to build

1222
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,879
the next facebook i want to build the

1223
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:02,319
next youtube

1224
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,319
they say like they want to build a

1225
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,920
company that is also

1226
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:07,920
learning from those companies both what

1227
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:09,680
those big companies did great because

1228
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:12,240
they did all the great things but also

1229
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:13,839
some of the mistakes that they did

1230
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,879
because they didn't get the right advice

1231
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,799
early on

1232
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,960
and very much about that is building

1233
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,319
companies which are thinking through

1234
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,200
all the different stakeholders in

1235
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,240
society whether those are third-party

1236
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:29,439
maybe consumers uh you know

1237
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,839
others you know the society and planet

1238
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:33,760
and that's something that young founders

1239
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:36,160
now are responding to really really well

1240
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:37,520
so that makes me really excited about

1241
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:39,920
that the next generation of tech

1242
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:41,839
companies will be much more

1243
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,200
inclusive and they will build cultures

1244
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,839
which are fundamentally much more

1245
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,399
inclusive

1246
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:48,400
and respectful of all different rights

1247
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:53,280
thank you so much niklas for ending on a

1248
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,760
on a positive and somehow like hopeful

1249
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,079
notes

1250
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,920
when it comes to the technologies that

1251
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,520
are coming next to us

1252
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,359
i encourage everyone to keep those

1253
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,280
conversations in the various forums that

1254
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:04,000
are available to the right con community

1255
