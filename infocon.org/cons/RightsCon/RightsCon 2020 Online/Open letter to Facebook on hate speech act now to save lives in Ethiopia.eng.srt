the online space

49
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,120

instigating violence offline

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,800

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:03,840
propagating hate

53
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,319
online this is not the first time that

uh happened in ethiopia and

57
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,480
so far facebook um has failed to prevent

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,720
the escalation of violence and or

59
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,040
incitement to violence on its platform

60
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,319

jumping into the conversation in the

68
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,319
discussion i will start with before

69
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
caddo

so could you please set the scene for us

71
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,280
what's happening in in ethiopia and what

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,319
is exactly the impact of fake news and

73
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,879
disinformation

74
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,879
in the country

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,920
thank you as you have already

76
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,760
mentioned this is not the first time

77
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,399
when uh

78
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:10,879
the impact of continued

79
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,400
disinformation uh caused or at least

80
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:17,358
triggered violence on the ground because

81
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,000
the people who are involved in offline

82
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:23,519
violence

83
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:23,519
are also online so they apparently post

84
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,840
content that might lead to violence

85
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,359
or at least trigger

86
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
according to the information that we

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,720
have so this is

88
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:41,040
practically what what happened so

89
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,160
especially in the past two years

90
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
ethiopia is

91
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:51,440
witnessing some sort of political

92
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:54,000
change or reform at first it was

93
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,360
you know mostly opening the political

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,800
space and it was

95
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,160
more of liberating but as uh

96
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:05,680
the political contestations

97
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:09,440
are you know uh becoming you know

98
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,160
uh wider and broader uh the the violence

99
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,160
on the ground

100
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,160
has been increasing we have been

101
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,360
witnessing a lot of

102
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,960
violence that that were deadly and

103
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,400
that destroyed a lot of properties of

104
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:29,039
individuals in different parts of the

105
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:32,320
country so if we take

106
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:36,400
the recent the recent phenomenon

107
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:39,360
it didn't exactly happen because

108
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,440
there was hate speech online or false

109
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,039
information online because

110
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:47,280
most of the time when when the

111
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
deadly violence happened internet was

112
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,520
shut across

113
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,639
the country but you know it has been

114
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,758
building

115
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:58,400
a lot of this information was creating

116
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,080
you know anger among the youngsters that

117
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,599
are involved in the recent

118
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,639
violence it has been you know building

119
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,560
hatred towards community members

120
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:15,199
so just the moment was assassinated

121
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:19,199
even before there was little information

122
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,520
about who might have killed that artist

123
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,479
people were sure that some community

124
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:26,479
members

125
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:30,000
were the perpetrators or the the the

126
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:33,199
killers of that artist so they

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:37,360
they go out to avenge uh

128
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:41,039
his murder and they destroyed

129
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:42,080
uh a lot of properties that killed a lot

130
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,400
of people

131
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
in the pile the violence so this is

132
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,440
practically happening in

133
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:50,080
the the misinformation false information

134
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,440
in

135
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:56,639
uh hate speech online is

136
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,039
not a separate issue to this incident it

137
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,720
is

138
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,599
interrelated because it has been

139
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:03,840
building cases to what's happening

140
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
now

141
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,240
i think it is a brief introduction to

142
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:15,119
what happens but we will come back to it

143
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:18,319
all later indeed thank you very much

144
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:20,800
so i'll turn to berhan i know that

145
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,039
accessnow and a bunch of other civil

146
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:24,639
society organizations from africa as

147
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:27,680
well as from around the globe

148
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:29,280
uh have sent a letter to facebook so

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,919
could you please tell us about this

150
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:33,919
letter uh to facebook and and why now

151
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,160
um thanks marwah and and thanks uh

152
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,759
one thing that i um also want to note on

153
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,400
his point earlier is that

154
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,319
you know much of the violence you know

155
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,799
there was also excessive use of uh

156
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:49,680
force by law enforcement agencies and

157
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,319
there was also

158
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,720
a deliberate lack of you know presence

159
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,199
of

160
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:56,800
um law enforcement agencies so that you

161
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,639
know the amount of people that have died

162
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,080
is definitely attributed to those two

163
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,720
and and of course the third cause as

164
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,719
well

165
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:04,400
um so specifically addressing your

166
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,879
question of why now

167
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,318
um you know we actually feel we're a bit

168
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,240
late to this conversation

169
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
we've seen a spot of violence happen in

170
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,879
october 2019 and

171
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,759
you know um and and as as refuge has

172
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,639
mentioned earlier

173
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:19,280
um there is you know the propagation of

174
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,199
hate

175
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,960
hateful content online the propagation

176
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
of finance and citing content online

177
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,280
disinformation and misinformation

178
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,000
on the platforms including facebook and

179
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,638
youtube

180
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,039
and others has been you know left as if

181
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,719
it's

182
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,399
you know the the the social media

183
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,760
context in ethiopia seem to be the wild

184
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,360
wild west where

185
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,880
you know any conversation goes you know

186
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:40,479
you can you can

187
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,919
threaten somebody's life you can you

188
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,599
know you know

189
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,600
try it you know put content that just

190
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,120
creates against 40 million people 6

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
million people it doesn't matter you can

192
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,080
post anything you want

193
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
without any consequences from and

194
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,279
without these platforms taking the

195
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,560
action that they're supposed to and you

196
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,360
know their corporate responsible their

197
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,479
business and human rights

198
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
responsibilities

199
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,680
um so they're missing all of those marks

200
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,800
on specifically

201
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,479
these things so now this time around um

202
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:05,760
you know when the what was really quite

203
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,760
visible and you know this was also

204
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
visible last year when

205
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,360
generals were assassinated in the

206
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,680
country when when the internet went off

207
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,000
and

208
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,680
a bunch of the trusted partners that are

209
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,680
that that have been you know that have

210
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,439
taken the burden of reporting content on

211
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,519
on facebook went offline because there

212
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,360
was complete internal shutdown

213
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,800
again what we saw online was this

214
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,279
rampant content

215
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,359
being spread online you know youtube

216
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:31,120
videos and and facebook live videos

217
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,120
calling for the assassination of

218
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,399
communities you know both minority and

219
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,640
majority

220
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:38,240
you know ethnic groups um so it was just

221
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,600
a wild wild west where for us we were

222
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,040
like you know we've been late to this

223
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,839
conversation it's not this is not the

224
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,839
first time

225
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,760
that this has happened but you know we

226
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,200
were like it's time to to call on these

227
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
platforms you know we've had

228
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,560
in numerous occasions we've talked to

229
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,439
them off the record we've talked to them

230
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,359
on the record

231
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
you know the the the the special

232
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,320
rapporteur for the uh special rapporteur

233
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,279
for freedom of expression

234
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,640
david k um on his last trip to ethiopia

235
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:02,880
uh you know he put out

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,079
a statement that was very clear on the

237
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,399
implication of disinformation

238
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:08,479
misinformation on on the on the you know

239
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,959
the the fledgling democracy in the

240
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,440
country and

241
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,439
its implication on uh and potential

242
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:15,920
implication on offline violence

243
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,600
so for us it's you know we're actually

244
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,360
we feel we're a bit too late in this

245
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,240
conversation we actually feel like we're

246
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,760
taking

247
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,880
i i you know when we were drafting all

248
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,640
of this we felt like we were being

249
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,279
actually opportunistic using this time

250
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,720
because

251
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,800
we should have done this in october we

252
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,320
should have done this in 2019 july we

253
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,640
should have done this in

254
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,160
in december 2018 but nothing seems to

255
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,920
change from their end

256
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,600
um so that's you know this this is the

257
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,839
reason we were saying you know why not

258
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,839
now

259
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:45,359
um thanks berhan and so what are your

260
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:48,240
demands what facebook needs

261
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:49,600
to do and how should they take their

262
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,040
responsibilities

263
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,519
towards that hate speech on its platform

264
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,439
um so the first thing is first right so

265
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:59,519
this this this this way of saying you

266
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,040
know the machine learning has to learn

267
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,279
the different language and you know

268
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,439
until then uh you know there isn't much

269
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,040
we can do it's not acceptable

270
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,120
like how long do we have to say our

271
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,719
lives matter how long do we have to tell

272
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,560
facebook and other other social

273
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:14,480
media platforms that people should not

274
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,920
be put at risk because the machine

275
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,519
learning has to learn

276
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,959
that's you know and in my head that's

277
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,720
not acceptable and i'm sure

278
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,719
and and this is not just an issue in

279
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,399
ethiopia we've seen this in myanmar we

280
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,279
see this in india we see this in brazil

281
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:27,680
we've seen this in

282
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,760
many many other countries so we are we

283
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,439
are not an outsider in this conversation

284
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,839
so the first one is you have to take

285
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,519
this seriously and we can't have another

286
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,200
myanmar happen on our hand

287
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,560
and you doing a human rights impact

288
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,000
assessment at the end

289
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:42,000
is not something that we want in this

290
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,720
case so this is our first demand

291
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,640
the second one is um so we want to like

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,160
we have an and in the letter we have two

293
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,279
specific you know immediate actions that

294
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,519
need to be taken and then

295
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:53,600
we have second version so if you look at

296
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,480
the the facebook app right now

297
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,399
um and and uh and and the way that

298
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,120
people can report content right now

299
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,839
it's only fully available in amharic

300
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:03,600
which is good

301
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,360
that we comment that but it also needs

302
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,800
to be available in other language

303
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:10,399
the first one is the second one is

304
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:12,399
the third one is somali and of course

305
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,800
you know other language as they develop

306
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,480
right

307
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,639
so this conversation of oh we don't have

308
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,320
enough translators is not acceptable you

309
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,720
are a rich a billion

310
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,360
dollar worth organization i'm sure you

311
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,360
can hire

312
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,200
more content moderators to to put on

313
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,000
board so our first our first demand is

314
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,839
actually that

315
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,519
content moderation especially because

316
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,600
majority of ethiopians access

317
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,800
you know facebook using their mobile

318
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,800
phones and

319
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,319
when you go with so on desktop you can

320
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,439
actually change the language so there's

321
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,040
a bit of an oromo

322
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,959
there's a bit of an amharic that you can

323
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,120
use but on mobile uh on

324
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,880
on mobile apps those are completely not

325
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,480
there so people should be able to report

326
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,839
content in their own mother tongue

327
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,600
you know even in my own mother tongue

328
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,040
it's so difficult to report content even

329
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,079
in english it's very difficult to report

330
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,599
content because

331
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,719
if you're not a lawyer if you're not in

332
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
this space you don't understand the

333
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
difference

334
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,959
it's very like the layman that the the

335
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
everyday ethiopian does not understand

336
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:02,719
the difference between hate speech and

337
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,839
discrimination right like so they're so

338
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,839
um the way that you report this is like

339
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
so specific so they they have to be able

340
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,760
to provide that in people's mother

341
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,000
tongue

342
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,319
the second one is you know our second

343
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,519
demand is pretty straightforward

344
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,560
please stop you know the propagation of

345
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,240
violent exciting content hateful content

346
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:24,160
on your platform and we know you know

347
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,839
we've had this conversation for

348
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:27,600
how many years now we know how the

349
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,440
algorithms work we know how

350
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,760
you know the the automatic content

351
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,000
suggestion systems also are used to

352
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,560
forget violence so we want that to stop

353
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,240
and we want specific actions to be taken

354
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,760
uh that that are visible that are that

355
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,199
are not going to happen in closed doors

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,839
we want to see this you know happening

357
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,399
on the

358
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,160
on the platforms that is visible to to

359
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,800
to to many other ethiopians

360
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,959
the third one and i think for us also

361
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:53,920
very important in this context is that

362
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:55,119
um okay the machine learning hasn't

363
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,279
learned my language

364
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
doesn't know how for generations doesn't

365
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,079
know the words that

366
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:02,079
has been used to discriminate against me

367
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:04,000
and other people for generations

368
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,439
maybe let's accept that but you have to

369
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,440
hire content moderators

370
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,959
and when you hire content moderators

371
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,480
they have to be people that understand

372
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,479
the social political

373
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
economical you know social structures of

374
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
the country you can't just hire somebody

375
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,720
off

376
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
of the market that that's going to be

377
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,760
able to do this and you know and the

378
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,040
people and and there needs to be a very

379
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,720
good collaboration with

380
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,240
with not just the content moderators but

381
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,000
you know the the human rights team

382
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,519
within facebook the policy

383
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,760
team has to be able to understand you

384
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,480
can't just hire you know somebody that

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
sits out of

386
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,000
you know berlin or or geneva that

387
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,560
doesn't understand

388
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,440
the ethiopian context and needs a lot of

389
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:39,680
you know time to

390
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,959
to to you know to be able to understand

391
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,399
these things you have to

392
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,319
we've you know we've been saying this

393
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,480
ethiopia is going to be the next myanmar

394
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,880
especially in the in the hateful content

395
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,680
space if we don't take action so we need

396
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
to see those

397
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,040
those actions being taken the third one

398
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,000
and the fourth one i think for me what's

399
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,599
important is that

400
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,440
we see the cycle of violence happening

401
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,880
over and over again we had a similar

402
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:01,040
situation in october

403
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,320
now you know within within eight months

404
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,839
we're here again and there's nothing to

405
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:04,720
guarantee that something is not going to

406
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,720
happen

407
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,480
you know in the next few months so there

408
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,360
needs to be an emergency escalation

409
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,920
system

410
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,519
for them to be able um you know to adapt

411
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,399
and to change as things happen on the

412
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,240
ground

413
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:18,000
um you know so the context from six

414
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
months ago has completely changed so

415
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,120
they also need to adapt

416
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,120
but you know and and saying this all of

417
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,399
these has to be in in human rights and

418
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,920
right respecting manner

419
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,680
we're not telling you to take down all

420
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,120
content we're not telling you to

421
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,959
you know highlight all content that's

422
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,480
not the case and i think the fifth one

423
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,638
and the most important one is they have

424
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,680
like again if the machine learning is

425
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:39,279
not up to

426
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:41,359
its task yet you have to spend you know

427
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:42,800
money you have to invest in communities

428
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:44,399
and you have to be able to teach people

429
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,359
how to report content

430
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:49,839
um so you know use the the advertisement

431
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:51,519
channels use tv stations to report

432
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:53,600
and and to show people on how to do this

433
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,240
but then you also have to do the extra

434
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,920
work when

435
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,759
once content is reported it has to be

436
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,079
taken down what we see now is that you

437
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,759
know

438
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,599
a similar content in amharic will be

439
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
taken down it won't be taken down and

440
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:05,199
or when you report it it will be taken

441
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,079
down in ramif it won't be taken down

442
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,839
into grenya

443
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:10,079
so all of those disparities are costing

444
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,440
human lives so we can't no longer

445
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,199
negotiate with this

446
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,199
so these are some of the demands and in

447
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,359
the letter that we have

448
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,800
thanks a lot bergen i think it's a loud

449
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,759
and clear cry

450
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,040
uh for ethiopia before it turns into

451
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,880
another myanmar

452
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,160
and for facebook to take responsibility

453
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,519
and he rightly

454
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:31,759
uh pointed out that this is not uh

455
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,680
only in ethiopia but also includes many

456
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,440
countries from around the world

457
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,279
um and unfortunately it doesn't look

458
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,199
like a problem of resources but

459
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:42,160
rather problem of political will for

460
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,880
them to to take on that responsibility

461
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
i will move on to back to you uh before

462
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,480
cardo

463
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:49,440
and um i mean you are a renowned

464
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,720
activist and

465
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:54,480
an advocate in ethiopia and your

466
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,680
organization was the first to sign on

467
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,759
that letter

468
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
why is this why is this letter important

469
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:03,920
to you

470
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,480
um this is important to us because you

471
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,799
know we

472
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,480
are very much concerned about the lives

473
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,039
that are being

474
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,760
lost in the properties that have been

475
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:15,039
lost in

476
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,439
uh we have been working

477
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,959
you know we have been trying to monitor

478
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,079
the social media

479
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:24,400
uh for forced information and hate

480
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:27,799
speech it has been there so

481
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,960
even though we could not find a direct

482
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:32,879
relationship

483
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:35,520
between of course there are direct

484
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:37,600
relationships that we can cite but you

485
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,559
know

486
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,760
for example in october there was there

487
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:45,600
was a

488
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,919
a post posted by a renault

489
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,959
activist but we could not call it false

490
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,880
information

491
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,520
we could not call it head speech but it

492
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,559
was completely necessity to say

493
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,679
to give it a name but in any case people

494
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:02,000
were angry and

495
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:03,600
were violent there happened conflicts

496
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,280
in the communal conflict is following

497
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:09,360
that post and also

498
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:13,360
uh police response was brutal but late

499
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:17,039
usually instead of preventing it is

500
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:19,600
uh you know using extra force

501
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:20,080
once it happened in the side of police

502
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,360
so

503
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,480
policy is not doing it's um it's its job

504
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,280
so at least

505
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,640
the social media platforms must be

506
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,440
responsible

507
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,559
for the consequence that their uh

508
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:36,000
platform is

509
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,720
you know uh bringing as a problem so

510
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:40,559
uh they they can we also believe that

511
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,640
they can do it because we have been

512
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:45,678
reporting contents that

513
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:50,080
might lead to eventual violence

514
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:52,720
like i was trying to say earlier

515
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:55,918
most of the violences may not be

516
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,919
directly related like the october one

517
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:59,600
they may not be directly related to the

518
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,039
violence that we've

519
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:06,240
witnessed uh these men last month or

520
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,080
uh previously but they build cases to

521
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,440
harness those kinds of violence

522
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,559
and from the past we also

523
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:16,880
expect similar incidents violent

524
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:20,399
incidents might happen in the future too

525
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:23,520
we we are going to

526
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,559
a much awaited

527
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:28,799
election it is extended due to uh

528
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,160
coffee pandemic but it is going to

529
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:32,559
happen anytime

530
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,200
uh in the future in the in the in the

531
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:36,720
couple of

532
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:39,679
years uh so

533
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:41,440
the there are terms that actually the

534
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:44,559
machine can learn

535
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:45,360
would lead to you know violence so it

536
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:48,000
has to

537
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,799
uh automatically respond to those terms

538
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,799
and then

539
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:54,559
you know they can make them available if

540
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,960
their content is not

541
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,000
the contents of the posters that have

542
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,559
those terms

543
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:02,080
are not that much dangerous they can

544
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:05,120
return them back but

545
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:07,439
they have to filter them out immediately

546
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,320
the moment they are posted because ma

547
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,120
most of these

548
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,080
terms hit full terms would actually

549
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:16,639
build cases for future violence if not

550
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:18,480
for current violence that's what's

551
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:21,679
happening all these informations

552
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:24,159
also play the same role

553
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,520
we have seen we have seen them all so

554
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,760
individually

555
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:33,120
let alone us who are organized enough to

556
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:36,240
to monitor and see the trends even

557
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,320
random individuals who are using the

558
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,520
social media in ethiopia who are

559
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:45,120
frequently using facebook in ethiopia

560
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:48,559
know that some specific incidents

561
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:51,918
are actually vulnerable to escalation of

562
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:55,840
hateful conversations that might

563
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,880
lead to violent aggressions between

564
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,760
people offline so the assassination of

565
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,320
hajj aloo

566
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,520
actually gave that alert to almost all

567
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:07,840
individuals who use

568
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,320
social media in interviews why

569
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,520
would the platform fail to understand

570
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,840
these things

571
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,000
so similarly the the political

572
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,760
conversation

573
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:24,559
has a lot of key terms that actually

574
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:27,520
feed such kind of hate-mongering

575
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:29,039
you know conversations and that those

576
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,080
are becoming also

577
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:34,080
excuses for internet shutdown

578
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,320
restriction of freedom of expression for

579
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:39,840
activists journalists and others

580
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:43,360
we were not able to access information

581
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,158
or speak what we think because internet

582
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,280
was shut for

583
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:51,200
three weeks the government used

584
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,080
uh this uh these kinds of incidents to

585
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,919
justify

586
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,840
the internet shutdown it wasn't though

587
00:21:53,919 --> 00:22:00,080
it's not legal or there is no

588
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:00,879
um necessary or legitimate justification

589
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,840
for

590
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:07,120
all what happened so this is why we need

591
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,840
the platform to be proactive instead of

592
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,120
being reactionary after things already

593
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,080
happened

594
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,439
um thanks a lot uh vivekado and uh

595
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:21,120
birhan i think that

596
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:23,280
brings us uh to um

597
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:25,360
to open the floor for questions from our

598
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,678
audience so if you'd like to ask

599
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,678
a question please add your question to

600
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:32,320
the chat box

601
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:33,200
and in the meantime i have a question

602
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:36,799
for

603
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,679
the both of you so while there is

604
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,600
incitement

605
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,960
violence on the platform and when

606
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,120
facebook quickly

607
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,679
or not so quickly reacts to removing

608
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,280
these uh documents as you uh sorry as

609
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:49,919

610
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,080
rights

611
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,480
organizations documenting uh

612
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:57,520
human rights violations or such calls

613
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,559
for violence

614
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:02,879
and for hate do you find it

615
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,158
um do you like what are your demands

616
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:07,440
also for the platform

617
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,440
for facebook to help you're

618
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,919
like help organizations that work on

619
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:15,280
documenting human rights violations

620
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,360
um and uh

621
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:19,678
for documentation and also to archive

622
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,559
them for later legislative for later

623
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,000
litigation

624
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:24,000
uh work

625
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,640
okay and while we are

626
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:35,760
monitoring uh the social media for for

627
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:38,799
false information in that speech

628
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,200
find a lot of information but we what we

629
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,158
are

630
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,159
at this point trying to try to do is

631
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:47,600
understand the trains

632
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,520
uh because they make sense the more you

633
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,039
are monitoring the social media for

634
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,320
these contents

635
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:57,120
they actually make senses we know when

636
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:58,320
uh when false information is carried

637
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,799
because it's not

638
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,559
it's not the same trade always when

639
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:05,279
there are some incidents

640
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:06,320
on the ground false information uh the

641
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,200
number of force information

642
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,000
disseminating

643
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:11,679
online increases and they aggravate the

644
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:14,480
the conflicts on the ground let me give

645
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:18,320
you one example for example

646
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:21,760
in in october 2018 uh and

647
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,158
some actually in november i'm thinking

648
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:26,320
in italian calendar that's why i say in

649
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,039
in november 2018 the

650
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,720
two students were killed in in a

651
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,200
university in

652
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,200
omaha

653
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,799
the reason was more of personality so

654
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,320
it's

655
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:42,639
it's not still clear but it looks

656
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,360
personal from the information that are

657
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,400
available

658
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,279
but on the social media it was over

659
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,400
politicized

660
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,360
and it has been ethnicized so

661
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:54,320
in in a kind of domino effect it almost

662
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:58,080
reached

663
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:01,760
27 universities and it has killed

664
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:05,918
about 12. it has caused the days of 12

665
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:09,120
students in in 2020

666
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,320
and 2019. so

667
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,439
the social media is playing

668
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:18,480
a role of escalating conflicts that

669
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,559
happened on on the ground and there were

670
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,679
force information that actually

671
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,879
ethnicized

672
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,200
those individual conflicts those

673
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,440
entirely individual conflicts

674
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,120
the same thing happened in different

675
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:34,880
conflicts so

676
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,360
uh we by by by trying to monitor

677
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:38,960
we are trying to understand some sort of

678
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:42,719
relationships

679
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:45,840
uh between the conflicts on ground and

680
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,279
online so if

681
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
but our our resources are very limited

682
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,600
if

683
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,520
many human rights organizations are

684
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,240
involved in such activities

685
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,000
we would have complete image of what's

686
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:01,440
happening on the social media

687
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:04,400
how we can control and prevent

688
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,400
their role as

689
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,320
aggravators of conflicts on the ground

690
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:11,679
and we can

691
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,120
maybe able to prevent

692
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:16,240
[Music]

693
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,879
coming conflicts or aggravations if not

694
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,320
you know

695
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:22,640
at least stop the previous one

696
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,240
also we can have by documenting and

697
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:27,279
following the trains

698
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:30,799
we can at least present

699
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:33,919
information so that the the victims

700
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:33,918
can get justice

701
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:40,960
thank you very much so bearhen would you

702
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,000
like to comment or add something

703
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:46,480
yeah um yeah um

704
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,440
i think one of the things one of um you

705
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,679
know the

706
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,720
the demand that we have also on that on

707
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,480
and that letter is

708
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,480
is to say that you know yes to take down

709
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,440
content that is that's inciting violence

710
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,880
that's hateful

711
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,880
and it's not within your community

712
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,360
standards but please take

713
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,080
take measure to to to archive that

714
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,199
content

715
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,039
so that you know one day um

716
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:08,559
and where we are now in ethiopia justice

717
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:12,000
seems to be such a food

718
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:13,840
term um you know i'm not sure when we'll

719
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,039
get there but at least for victims

720
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:18,799
for national jurisdiction um you know uh

721
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
mechanisms for international groups to

722
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:21,840
be able to investigate

723
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:23,919
um and to understand what happened in

724
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,000
the online space the second one is and i

725
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,399
think one context that that is important

726
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,039
here

727
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,719
is um there aren't that many digital

728
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,240
rights civil society organizations let

729
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,880
alone civil society organizations in

730
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,960
ethiopia

731
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,919
we've lived for the past 28 years under

732
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:38,000
dictatorship

733
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,440
now that has shifted a bit um there

734
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,840
seems to be a bit more

735
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,200
um you know a freedom of expression

736
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,320
access to information and many other

737
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,360
fundamental rights but

738
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:48,000
we're not fully there so in and raises a

739
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,080
really important

740
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,520
point here that you know um one thing

741
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,199
that we're struggling with is

742
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,120
understanding actually what happens

743
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,640
online we don't have the full picture

744
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:58,080
what the you know the the few answer

745
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
little things that we mentioned to you

746
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,039
here are things that have

747
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,559
you know exponentially you know grown

748
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,840
online you know went

749
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,760
viral and were able to catch the

750
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,360
attention of many of us there are many

751
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,399
micro things that happen online that

752
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:10,399
were unable to

753
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:12,399
you know to understand but that have and

754
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:13,039
might have you know big implications on

755
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:15,360
on

756
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:16,799
our fledgling democracy and and you know

757
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,199
and and the

758
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:20,799
you know harmony and national national

759
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
cohesion of the country as well

760
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,679
um so that's one of the things that

761
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,200
we're struggling with but i think at

762
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,159
least from one thing that facebook can

763
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,480
do right now and

764
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,000
other platforms as well youtube is

765
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:31,600
youtube is going to be soon very

766
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,679
fully implicated in this because they're

767
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:35,360
also unable to take down certain content

768
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,440
and we're definitely reaching out to

769
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,320
them soon so i if they're on this call

770
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,080
they should

771
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,799
they should you know look look into that

772
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,879
is at least archiving that content is

773
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,960
really really important and being able

774
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,360
for victims and other people to have

775
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,039
easy access to that so that we can study

776
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,879
it we can understand it and we can learn

777
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,879
from it

778
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:56,480
thanks a lot sir bearhen so we have a

779
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:59,279
few questions from the audience

780
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:01,279
and i'll start with the first uh

781
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,440
stopping this information was one of the

782
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,279
justifications for the shutdown

783
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:07,440
but it actually seems to be fueled by

784
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,159
limiting voices and online sources of

785
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:10,320
information

786
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,720
doesn't it so i'll post the questions to

787
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:14,559
you and whoever feels uh

788
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:18,399
wants to go first and the second can

789
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:18,399
just follow with the answer

790
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:23,200
uh i have said some things about that

791
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:25,279
internet

792
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:27,039
this information has been a

793
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,320
justification for

794
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,520
international down so let me try to

795
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,760
explain what i mean

796
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:35,360
it doesn't matter whether actually the

797
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:39,520
international town

798
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:42,000
uh which caused more violence on ground

799
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:43,279
and suppress you know the reporting of

800
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,000
it or not

801
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:46,720
uh the the government in any case you

802
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:50,799
know since

803
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:54,080
the platforms are not uh

804
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,760
are not responding quickly they are

805
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:59,279
using some contents online as a

806
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:02,640
justification as a

807
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:07,840
as they cause that there would have been

808
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:10,880
more violence

809
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,639
content online if they did not shut the

810
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:15,840
internet so

811
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,200
that's why we are actually asking the

812
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,678
platforms to be

813
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,559
you know proactive and to respond

814
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:24,080
quickly

815
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,200
otherwise it would be used

816
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,879
as an excuse it keeps on you know being

817
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,960
used as an excuse by the

818
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,399
authoritarian government to suppress it

819
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,640
but

820
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:39,279
from what we have seen now

821
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:40,320
we we cannot even give examples because

822
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,720
you know it was

823
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,360
the internet like i said it was down

824
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:49,279
but in the blackout there was violence

825
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:52,799
we heard about the violence

826
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:56,240
two days later in three days later

827
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,240
we i don't believe that we have actually

828
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,200
a clear picture of what happened i've

829
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:03,600
been visiting one of the cities

830
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,720
the towns that actually experienced the

831
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,158
worst violence

832
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:11,279
in the last last

833
00:31:08,159 --> 00:31:14,720
last time two weeks ago so or emmanuel

834
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:17,519
actually so what i

835
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:18,720
what i understood from what i have seen

836
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,080
yesterday

837
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:24,240
is that actually we did not have

838
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,519
a clear picture of what happened the

839
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,799
people

840
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:32,640
tried to explain to me some of

841
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:36,158
what happened and i i tried actually

842
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:36,559
to to look back into what i was thinking

843
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,960
and

844
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,320
there is actual gap between my

845
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,919
understanding and

846
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,200
uh the reality because internet was shot

847
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:50,480
also we didn't learn about

848
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,760
police restraint during that

849
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,960
those violences but later they took

850
00:31:53,760 --> 00:32:00,158
uh excessive force to stop the violence

851
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:03,600
once it has escalated the crowd

852
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,320
you know if we had internet connectivity

853
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,360
maybe

854
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,840
we hear about the violences early

855
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,840
uh also there are a lot of people on

856
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:14,158
online it's not only

857
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:16,639
violence instigators who are online so

858
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,960
you know the government will be

859
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:21,519
put in pressure so that they respond

860
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,519
quickly

861
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,960
in any case the internet is down now it

862
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,600
has a lot of justifications

863
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,399
because of the the refrain from the

864
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,519
social

865
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:36,799
media platforms and now

866
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,120
i meet every day and try to explain

867
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,720
why internet should not be down during

868
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,760
such violence

869
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:47,440
but people usually get convinced

870
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,320
of the government propaganda that this

871
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:51,039
this is the case actually if it was not

872
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,519
down

873
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:59,039
the the conflict would be worse

874
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:01,440
thanks a lot berhan do you want to add

875
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,440
something

876
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,360
yeah um i i think what makes the

877
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,320
internet shut down this time around a

878
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,479
bit different

879
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,678
um for us is that you know i personally

880
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:10,399
have to have conversations with my

881
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,600
parents

882
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,360
where they were like maybe this time

883
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:14,240
around because it was shut down you know

884
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,639
it was good

885
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
you can see that there's a lot of um and

886
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,480
and what that really tells me is that

887
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,039
you know

888
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,880
the government has used disinformation

889
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:24,559
misinformation fake news and violence

890
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,840
inciting content other justifications to

891
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:27,600
shut down the internet

892
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,840
and really at the core of it control the

893
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,080
narrative so and you know what

894
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:32,959
i'm saying here is so important that

895
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:35,360
until today

896
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,799
we don't know the extent of the violence

897
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,158
in the country

898
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,840
not necessarily because the internet was

899
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,360
shut down but then

900
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:43,360
the fact that the internet was shut down

901
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,519
really contributes to that the fact that

902
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,840
we fluctuate between saying 160 people

903
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:49,760
have died to 200 to 400

904
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,279
there's so many you know individuals in

905
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:52,240
between that many numbers right like

906
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:55,279
we're talking about in

907
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,399
actual individuals human beings and the

908
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:58,080
fact that you know

909
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:59,918
and again relating this back to the

910
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,240
topic that we're talking about today

911
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,679
the the lack of action from from these

912
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:05,760
platforms to take down

913
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:07,600
legitimate content that's inciting

914
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,480
violence and there's a specific video

915
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,239
that has been

916
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,480
circulating around that was taken down

917
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:13,839
later was used as a justification by

918
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,359
government officials you know

919
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,839
that were either reaching out to us

920
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,918
individually as as people that they know

921
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:20,960
or you know as using it as a narrative

922
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:22,319
in the country so

923
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,480
that is really dangerous and is

924
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,760
affecting you know human rights work is

925
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,599
effectively freedom of expression is

926
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,800
affecting the press freedom and many

927
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,280
other fundamental

928
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:34,320
rights in the country so that's a really

929
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:36,960
you know salient point here as well

930
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,639
thanks a lot bear ham um i'll move to

931
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,480
the second question

932
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:44,399
um how do you feel with the concern

933
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:46,399
some groups have about excessive

934
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:50,719
takedowns when we ask for swift

935
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,719
action to take incitement down

936
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:58,000
um i i i can i can start with that our

937
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:00,400
our call is not for excessive takedowns

938
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,760
all of these actions that are used for

939
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,440
content moderation should be right

940
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,880
respecting should be within

941
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:07,119
uh you know within the international

942
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,320
standard standards of human rights right

943
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:11,280
um so uh we've seen in many cases where

944
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,359
um you know

945
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,800
and i think there was at some point

946
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,680
where your content was being either

947
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,240
taken down

948
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,598
or you are unable to to post on on on

949
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:21,040
facebook at some point i think and

950
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,480
correct me if i'm wrong about that

951
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:24,400
so that's not what we're looking for

952
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,560
here what we're looking for is you know

953
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,920
for them to take swift action in a sense

954
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,839
that increase the number of content

955
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,000
moderators that you have

956
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,759
when legitimate what we're seeing now is

957
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:35,280
not excessive takedown and i wish the

958
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,599
conversation was about that

959
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,800
because then that's that's again you

960
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:40,160
know they shouldn't do excessive

961
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,680
takedown but that's a very different

962
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:44,000
conversation that we'll be having

963
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:45,598
right now what we're seeing is you

964
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:48,400
report the content in amharic

965
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,240
it will be taken down it will take time

966
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,560
but it will go down at some point

967
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:54,000
you contend that report in oramifa it

968
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,240
takes a really long time before it's

969
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,000
taken down you contend

970
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:59,598
you report the content into grinya

971
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,119
that's a whole different context

972
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,640
so what we're seeing is not excessive

973
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:04,400
takedown rather it's the lack of

974
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:06,879
takedown that we're seeing that is

975
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,440
that might actually have an implication

976
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,480
on on

977
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:12,480
offline uh lives of individuals

978
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:14,560
but again this takedown should be right

979
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,680
respecting there's no you know those two

980
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,359
things are not the same there's no

981
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,319
justification for excessive takedown in

982
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,799
this context

983
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:22,240
you know said that said and what we're

984
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,599
saying again here is that we've seen

985
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,799
this over and over again we should be

986
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:26,640
able to learn from this

987
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,640
so set the right parameters set the

988
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,078
right emergency escalation systems

989
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,160
you know you have trusted partners you

990
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,040
have many other folks that have been

991
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:35,440
used you know that

992
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,200
are in within this um that are in

993
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,480
engagement with with facebook

994
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,000
this is not the first time that is

995
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:41,440
happening in ethiopia we've learned this

996
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,920
from myanmar we've learned this from

997
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,680
india

998
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:45,119
so please take all of that experiences

999
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,640
and try to understand

1000
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:48,400
what is happening here we're not asking

1001
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:49,759
for excessive takedowns and that should

1002
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,480
not be the case and those two things i

1003
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,160
don't think

1004
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,240
should be synonymous absolutely it's not

1005
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,359
like going from one extreme to the other

1006
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:02,240
that's definitely not the solution um

1007
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:04,160
we have another question um and i think

1008
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:06,319
it's a very important one

1009
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,279
would you include the diaspora into this

1010
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:09,440
conversation

1011
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,760
and is there a call to regulate content

1012
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:14,560
posted abroad that perpetuates violence

1013
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
in ethiopia

1014
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:22,320
who wants to yeah

1015
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:23,440
well there are a lot of content that are

1016
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,920
produced from

1017
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:25,920
abroad

1018
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:31,040
there are political i mean of course

1019
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,480
most of the the

1020
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:37,920
posters that usually incite violence

1021
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,400
are politically motivated but you know

1022
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,520
they seem it is usually ethnically

1023
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,800
targeted but

1024
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,160
there we found pages that actually

1025
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:51,040
pretend to be a member of to pretend to

1026
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:54,399
be run by a member of one ethnic group

1027
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,759
uh and you know posters hateful content

1028
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,240
against the other but

1029
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,520
at the same time the same page used to

1030
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,040
you know

1031
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:06,400
incite violence against the same

1032
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,400
ethnic group which it pretended to be

1033
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:13,599
a member of previously so you know

1034
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,079
you somehow understand they have

1035
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,960
different political agenda or they may

1036
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,079
be from a very different ethnic

1037
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,760
group membership so

1038
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:29,839
there are those kinds of pages and

1039
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:33,200
when we follow the the their posters

1040
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,520
they make posters even when internet is

1041
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,439
down in ethiopia so

1042
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:39,040
we can certainly assume that they are

1043
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,560
run by a

1044
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:45,759
person from the diaspora

1045
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:49,520
by the way during the past days

1046
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:52,480
when the internet was down i i found out

1047
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,400
when it is back that there is a facebook

1048
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,920
page created to

1049
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,960
report headphone contents

1050
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:02,720
it is it's called network again state

1051
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:05,760
speech in ethiopia

1052
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,200
also has an american name mentor

1053
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,320
so they reported they reported

1054
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:14,799
about 102

1055
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,400
contents that are violent and posted by

1056
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,040
the diaspora community

1057
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,079
uh because it already internet was down

1058
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:23,279
back then

1059
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,960
and they have 72 percent of

1060
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:28,000
success in in their reporters have been

1061
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,680
you know

1062
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:33,599
removed because they are made

1063
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,319
they meet the community standards of

1064
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,040
facebook but the remaining are still

1065
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,560
live that we i have seen some of them i

1066
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,720
still believe they should be

1067
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,920
removed because even though they don't

1068
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:46,240
seem

1069
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,640
somehow they are violating but you know

1070
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,640
when you

1071
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,400
understand the context on the ground

1072
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,640
they need to be removed

1073
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:58,160
so yes there are contents and there are

1074
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,560
attempts to

1075
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,118
report those as well if i found the

1076
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,119
question with

1077
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,880
rahan do you want to jump in um

1078
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,078
yeah so i think one thing to understand

1079
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,440
here is that you know the ethiopian

1080
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,000
diaspora um

1081
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,599
um because of you know the the the 40 50

1082
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:19,760
years of injustice people have have

1083
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,160
have have lived through you know the

1084
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,560
diaspora in in washington dc is a strong

1085
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,960
one

1086
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:25,599
the diaspora and london and stockholm

1087
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,359
and you know

1088
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,800
frankfurt is you know everywhere you go

1089
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:30,160
there's an ethiopian restaurant because

1090
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,079
ethiopians live there

1091
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:34,319
right um so that that's that's how

1092
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,720
strong the ethiopian community is right

1093
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:38,319
um so that's um and there's a reason why

1094
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,759
people are so invested in

1095
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:41,759
ethiopian politics and what we've seen

1096
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:42,400
and as before has rightfully pointed out

1097
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,240
is

1098
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,839
when the internet goes off the hateful

1099
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,839
content doesn't stop

1100
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,680
um but what what seems to happen is that

1101
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,880
you know the trusted partners the people

1102
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,359
that actually

1103
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,960
for free do this work for for facebook

1104
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,400
not because they want to

1105
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,160
help facebook it's because they care

1106
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,599
about their country and and the things

1107
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,040
that they're seeing online

1108
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:02,640
when they go offline because they don't

1109
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,200
have access to internet it doesn't mean

1110
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,560
that

1111
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,118
the hateful content stops um so that

1112
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:10,799
you know so that that whole silicon

1113
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,240
valley system of one system works for

1114
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,839
the whole rest of the world

1115
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,359
doesn't work in this context so and

1116
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:16,640
we've seen this many times not the first

1117
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:17,359
time that ethiopia has shut down the

1118
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,680
internet

1119
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,279
and the diaspora has taken over so what

1120
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,319
adjustments have been made since the

1121
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:24,160
last

1122
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:26,480
you know many many um you know multiple

1123
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:28,399
incidents of violence in the country

1124
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:30,880
so the diaspora is really strong has you

1125
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,880
know um that transatlantic relationship

1126
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,440
between between those in the u.s those

1127
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,520
in

1128
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,560
europe and those in you know in the arab

1129
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:38,480
world um

1130
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,920
you know if you look at remit remittance

1131
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:40,400
in the country if you look at in the way

1132
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,160
that

1133
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,480
information is passed you know our

1134
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,160
struggles are not just in ethiopia

1135
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:48,880
it's it's it's beyond right like it's

1136
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:50,480
it's basically everywhere you go so

1137
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,079
again in the way that these companies

1138
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:53,920
work and engage um and

1139
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:55,359
with the token users it's not just about

1140
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,880
the six to seven million

1141
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,319
users in ethiopia it's also about the

1142
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,839
folks that are in dc it's also about the

1143
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:02,000
folks that are in berlin

1144
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,319
um so they have to be able to adapt and

1145
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,480
change within that so the diaspora is

1146
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:07,599
um you know a really significant you

1147
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,480
know when you talk about if you okay

1148
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,800
talk about

1149
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,520
the ethiopians in dc i think for me and

1150
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,960
that that's

1151
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:15,200
how strong do you know the ethiopian

1152
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,400
diaspora is and heavily invested in good

1153
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:20,720
and bad faith as well

1154
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:22,319
indeed i actually lived in dc some time

1155
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:25,919
ago and i remember how

1156
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:30,880
big the diaspora from ethiopia is there

1157
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:33,040
uh okay so we are have

1158
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:34,480
okay actually we have a comment and i'll

1159
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:37,920
read that uh

1160
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,640
from radzgan abu bakr he says yes lean

1161
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,560
into the

1162
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,839
into your diaspora that's how the

1163
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:44,000
sudanese

1164
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:47,200
uh kept it on while the internet was

1165
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,640
shot during the revolution last year

1166
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:54,879
um our last question uh

1167
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,240
for today i think is which regulatory

1168
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,800
modality i.e command and control

1169
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:02,399
core regulation or self-regulation do

1170
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,480
you think is the best one to achieve

1171
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,560
adequate regulation of this information

1172
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,839
on social media platforms under

1173
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,839
emergency situations

1174
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,200
i see you berhan um

1175
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:18,720
i don't think there's uh you know this

1176
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,839
even this idea of co-regulation

1177
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,799
self-regulation

1178
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,000
command and control um like all of those

1179
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,920
things are words

1180
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:27,200
that don't that don't mean much to me i

1181
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,960
think uh

1182
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,480
at the core of it it has to be about

1183
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,560
what actions are going to be taken and

1184
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:34,560
what scenarios are we talking about

1185
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,240
um so you know violence is happening in

1186
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,720
the somali region in ethiopia

1187
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,479
that's a very different context than it

1188
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,000
happening in addis

1189
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,599
it's a very different context than it

1190
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,319
happening in an ambo

1191
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:47,040
right um so it has to be so they have to

1192
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:49,119
think about the

1193
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,880
the scenarios and the narratives and i

1194
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,599
know um you know for me as a social

1195
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,359
scientist

1196
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:54,880
there's like you know i we should sit

1197
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,480
down they shouldn't

1198
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,839
involve anthropologists they should

1199
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,400
involve ethnographers they should

1200
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,520
involve

1201
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,280
psychologists they should involve

1202
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:02,480
political scientists to understand what

1203
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:04,160
this is if we're talking about real

1204
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:05,440
solutions to these problems

1205
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,680
that is the thing that i'm seeing but

1206
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,040
for now i think what's really important

1207
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,879
is context

1208
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:12,079
context of people that understand the

1209
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:13,760
ethiopian context

1210
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:16,000
context of people that understand the

1211
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,560
language and the different ways that we

1212
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,000
use them

1213
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,319
you know and and and the way that

1214
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,920
amharic is spoken when when you stress

1215
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,079
on certain words and when you loosen it

1216
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:25,839
up it's a completely different

1217
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:27,440
context so that's also what history is

1218
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:29,839
right and that's also what

1219
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:31,200
what our lives are so i think for me

1220
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,680
it's about you know

1221
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,279
immediately increase your yes it's about

1222
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,000
self-regulation because i don't think

1223
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,200
they can

1224
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,440
now in the states work with the

1225
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,319
government to to to be correlated

1226
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:42,800
technically

1227
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,079
social media is quote is under cover

1228
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:45,520
government regulation they have to take

1229
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:48,800
down content that's reported to them

1230
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:51,040
within 24 hours um technically if

1231
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,560
they're supposed to abide by ethiopian

1232
00:44:51,040 --> 00:44:54,079
legislation right now but that's not the

1233
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:54,640
case that that legislation is extremely

1234
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:56,480
flawed

1235
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:57,920
in the sense that it doesn't it's

1236
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,520
toothless in a sense it doesn't do

1237
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:01,520
anything when it comes to

1238
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,720
it doesn't do it much when it comes to

1239
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,880
you know holding

1240
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,879
social media platforms accountable you

1241
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,079
know the onus is on the individuals that

1242
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:10,400
are propagating hate

1243
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,920
but that can't be the way that we're

1244
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,520
going so it has to be about

1245
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,880
working with civil society organization

1246
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,400
it has to be about working with the

1247
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:18,079
diaspora it has to be about

1248
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:19,599
working with people like before kadu and

1249
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,119
others that are on the ground that are

1250
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,599
doing this work that are experiencing

1251
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:23,680
this

1252
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,359
and you know it also has to be about

1253
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,960
human rights impact assessment

1254
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,960
not not one that's just going to be

1255
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:30,319
shoved within within this these

1256
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,200
platforms it has to be one that's

1257
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:32,560
publicly

1258
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,560
published and we've seen some of the

1259
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:37,759
actions facebook has taken

1260
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:39,200
after myanmar um so those you know

1261
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,800
that should be our learning right like

1262
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,759
so for me it's not about co-regulating

1263
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:43,839
self-regulation

1264
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:45,760
it's about taking those steps to save

1265
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:46,078
you know um potential lives that might

1266
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,839
be

1267
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:50,640
lost because of the lack of action from

1268
00:45:47,839 --> 00:45:50,640
these platforms

1269
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,720
uh thanks a lot yeah it's about real

1270
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:57,920
action and not just

1271
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,078
policy words that are void of the local

1272
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:03,119
context and the real people who uh

1273
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,640
can make an impact on the ground uh do

1274
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,119
you want to add something to bear

1275
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:08,078
to what bear hand said yeah i i just

1276
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:10,880
want yeah

1277
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,839
to say some things it's not about

1278
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:15,920
command and

1279
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,960
control uh when we demand the platforms

1280
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:20,240
respond or

1281
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,560
uh actually proactively you know lead

1282
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:23,759
the

1283
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,119
anti-disinformation and anti-speech

1284
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,480
campaigns

1285
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:31,920
it is because their failure to actually

1286
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:35,280
uh clean their platforms is

1287
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:39,119
you know imposing a lot of burden on

1288
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,599
on the people in authoritarian

1289
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:42,160
living in authoritarian systems you know

1290
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:45,440
i am

1291
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:48,720
a social media enthusiast myself when

1292
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:50,480
it was uh barely possible to speak to

1293
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,720
power

1294
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,920
in in ethiopia we used actually the

1295
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:57,919
social media

1296
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,880
to voice ourselves to to

1297
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,839
to speak you know uh and to be

1298
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:04,960
eventually

1299
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:08,078
heard to some extent so uh i am

1300
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,280
social media enthusiast and we

1301
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:12,319
are we are always concerned about you

1302
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,800
know

1303
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:16,160
promoting conflict sensitive dialogue

1304
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,560
that can be possible

1305
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:20,078
when the the platforms respond quickly

1306
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,880
and proactively

1307
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:23,200
otherwise the governments are using it

1308
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:25,680
as

1309
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:27,439
excuse to to you know to suppress

1310
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,558
freedom of expression in the country we

1311
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:32,079
have already have

1312
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,440
a law that that is intended intending to

1313
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:34,480
repress

1314
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:37,440
you know false information

1315
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,000
disseminations uh we are experiencing

1316
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,119
international

1317
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:44,800
drones frequently that's why we

1318
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:47,839
want the platforms to take over not not

1319
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:49,440
a demand to command and control also

1320
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:52,160
we know and recognize our

1321
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,559
responsibilities we believe that we can

1322
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,598
we can do something using the platform

1323
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:57,839
itself if

1324
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:59,839
the platforms are cooperative enough to

1325
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:02,880
do you know media literacy

1326
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:03,440
uh we also use the same platform you

1327
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,200
know

1328
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:06,800
to demand the government transparency

1329
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:10,480
when they fail to

1330
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,000
uh we also want to help them accountable

1331
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,440
when they fail

1332
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:18,839
in being transparent or when they fail

1333
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,319
to do you know the right governance

1334
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:25,759
so it should be seen as an effort to

1335
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:30,160
uh you know to have a an environment

1336
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:34,400
that we can call regulate one another

1337
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,799
i i see it that way

1338
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,680
uh thank you so we have a comment from

1339
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,640
myanmar

1340
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:41,680
uh from kin i hope i'm pronouncing your

1341
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:44,879
name right

1342
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,160
forgive me if i don't um he says

1343
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,200
i think or she uh i think when it comes

1344
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,558
risk to when it comes to respond when it

1345
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,160
comes to responding to excessive

1346
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,200
takedowns it shouldn't be on the civil

1347
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
society

1348
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:58,879
who are most of the time rolling the

1349
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,520
sleeves to do the stuff facebook should

1350
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,880
be doing

1351
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,440
given the fact that they have a lot of

1352
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:05,359
resources and money to do so

1353
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,480
when the civil society asks for the

1354
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:08,960
consistency in

1355
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,520
in terms of duplicate content and many

1356
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,160
more

1357
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,839
the excessive takedown might happen and

1358
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,078
i believe it shouldn't be

1359
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:16,960
circled back to the civil societies asks

1360
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,119
but question

1361
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,960
the platform if they are doing their job

1362
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:24,720
right thanks berhan

1363
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:29,040
and all for this session um we have

1364
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:32,399
what i believe last question actually uh

1365
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:34,880
from okay

1366
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,720
so the question reads you have said that

1367
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,720
this information is spread over

1368
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,399
different platforms besides claiming

1369
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,240
responsibility for

1370
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:44,559
each of the platforms what can civil

1371
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:45,919
society do to neutralize this discourse

1372
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:49,440
of hate online

1373
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:49,440
on those same platforms

1374
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:57,279
i have briefly mentioned what the civil

1375
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:00,960
society can do

1376
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:03,359
it's i mean especially it is

1377
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:05,040
media literacy that the civil society

1378
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,078
that

1379
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:10,800
can do uh broadly because you know

1380
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,359
uh the the problem in our context for

1381
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,839
example

1382
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,960
is that people tend to believe whatever

1383
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,119
is written on

1384
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:18,880
the social media what whatever the

1385
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:22,000
social media is facebook or

1386
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:24,880
other so

1387
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,480
this happened because of the repressive

1388
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:28,880
political history we have

1389
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,599
the mainstream media especially the

1390
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,000
state-run

1391
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:33,280
media organizations that have broader

1392
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,839
risk than any other

1393
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,319
mainstream media there have been you

1394
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:39,359
know

1395
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:42,400
propaganda missions for the ruling party

1396
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,040
and they are still the same so

1397
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:47,280
people tend to believe individual

1398
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:50,079
citizen journalists online and

1399
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:52,480
when they the the the people the

1400
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:55,520
citizens journalists write

1401
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,800
angrily they share some of those

1402
00:50:55,520 --> 00:51:01,359
angers and they take you know when

1403
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,160
they are ethnicized like they are

1404
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:05,200
happening

1405
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:07,040
most of the times they also you know

1406
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:08,960
find themselves there they are

1407
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,040
emotionally appealing to the

1408
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:12,720
to the leaders and majority of our

1409
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:15,759
population if you know

1410
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,319
are the youths

1411
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:19,359
like 70 percent of europeans are below

1412
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:21,440
the age of 30.

1413
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:22,640
so you know they tend to believe

1414
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:25,680
whatever is written

1415
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,078
on the social media so they it needs

1416
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,440
this

1417
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:33,280
massive campaign on media literacy

1418
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:36,960
what is fake news but you know uh

1419
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:41,280
how how can it you know appear

1420
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,079
is it in a circuit sarcastic manner

1421
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,920
in jokes embedded in jokes or in

1422
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:48,400
pretending to be a fact

1423
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:49,760
having figures and pictures that are

1424
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:54,240
photoshopped

1425
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:58,079
even videos um so people don't know

1426
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:59,919
much about fake fake news or false

1427
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:02,400
information in this information

1428
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,160
they don't know the the conceptual or

1429
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,680
the legal frameworks

1430
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:09,680
about hates hate speech they don't know

1431
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,720
what happens where

1432
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,720
they don't know much about the

1433
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:16,399
consequences of their uh

1434
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:19,359
their words or wordings in political

1435
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:20,800
conversations so the civil society the

1436
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:24,160
role of the civil society

1437
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:27,920
is to educate or to use even those

1438
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:31,920
same platforms in

1439
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:36,000
teaching the audiences

1440
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:39,119
about what this means to them or

1441
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:41,680
how they should take news but

1442
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:42,960
it is not an easy task it is not you

1443
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:46,160
know to teach people

1444
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,640
to teach social media users about fake

1445
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:50,078
news

1446
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:52,240
is not as appealing as ethnically

1447
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:54,720
charged politically charged content

1448
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,598
so it is very difficult it takes a lot

1449
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,759
of efforts

1450
00:52:55,599 --> 00:53:01,839
resources and big mobilization

1451
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,160
that's why it is difficult but still

1452
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:06,880
some organizations like ours

1453
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,520
understood the problem in our role we

1454
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,160
believe

1455
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:11,440
but like i said it is a difficult job it

1456
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:14,480
detects

1457
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:16,880
much effort we will try as much as

1458
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:16,880
we can

1459
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,558
and your efforts are indeed very crucial

1460
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,440
so berhan do you want to have the last

1461
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:26,240
word for

1462
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,240
the session today

1463
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:32,640
um sure um you know so

1464
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:33,359
um the reality is you know um we need to

1465
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:36,400
do work

1466
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:38,078
um on the ground and again um you know

1467
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,680
whenever i speak with government i

1468
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,119
always say nobody goes out to kill

1469
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,640
somebody because somebody on facebook

1470
00:53:41,119 --> 00:53:44,000
told them to go kill them

1471
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,839
you know in most context that's not the

1472
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,280
case right like so if you're telling me

1473
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,078
to go kill somebody from a different

1474
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:49,920
ethnic group

1475
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:51,200
there's because there's foundational

1476
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:53,040
problems on the ground and you know

1477
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,078
generational trauma and problems that we

1478
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,079
haven't dealt with

1479
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:57,920
so the honest again you know in this if

1480
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:59,280
we're talking about violence and people

1481
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:00,800
being put in danger and their lives

1482
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,160
being put in danger it's about

1483
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,920
governments taking that actions about

1484
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,359
conflict resolutions about you know

1485
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:07,040
transitional justice about you know

1486
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:09,119
conflict resolution and

1487
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,960
and reconciliation um right like so i

1488
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,520
think civil society needs to act in that

1489
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,319
space

1490
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,839
but then also online um unfortunately

1491
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,319
again the burden falls on

1492
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:19,520
on us as civil society as activists as

1493
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,558
as you know as individuals as

1494
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,800
researchers

1495
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:24,319
um to to carry this burden even to have

1496
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,000
this conversation rather than do our

1497
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,920
actual work that we're supposed to do

1498
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:29,920
where you know we're busy drafting you

1499
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,559
know letters we're busy engaging on in

1500
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,960
the space

1501
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:33,680
without without much change happening so

1502
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:36,559
and and

1503
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:38,558
i genuinely hope that this is a wake-up

1504
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,839
call for them and and you know

1505
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:43,520
so that this the cycle of violence as

1506
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,599
unfortunately as it continues to happen

1507
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,559
in ethiopia at least some actions should

1508
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,960
be taken in

1509
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:50,799
in in the online space and in in

1510
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,799
platforms such as facebook

1511
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:55,200
you know youtube twitter and and others

1512
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:57,200
are equally you know cutable in in

1513
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,480
in this so um i'm hoping they really

1514
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,160
heed um

1515
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,000
you know we're frustrated but you know

1516
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,399
we're we're it's important to engage
