access now's report well throughout

17

2020 we have been seeing a rising tide

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,879
of protests worldwide

19
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,640
that are sparking discussions on the

rights to freedom of peaceful assembly

shed light on the impact of technology

on both the protection and the

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
restriction

00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:09,520
of such rights earlier this week access

now published its first report

28
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,840
focused exclusively on the intersection

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,439
of technologies and the rights to

30
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
freedom of peaceful assembly and a

31
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960

by providing an

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
overview of our report as i'm sure many

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,720
of you have been attending

49
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,000
rights con online sessions you haven't

50
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,640
had the opportunity

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
to read a 50 page paper with over 200

52
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:00,719
footnotes

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,560
and on that note i would like to also if

54
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,919
you haven't checked it out already we do

55
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,560
have a much more

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,318
digestible five page summary of the

57
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
report which really distills you know

58
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:13,519
the key case studies key takeaways

59
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,280
and recommendations um and as uh

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,599
carolina mentioned i'll then hand it off

61
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,160
to

62
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,200
my colleague peter mysek will then focus

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,760
in on some of the

64
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,799
case studies of protests worldwide

65
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,840
piloting both

66
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
the power and also the fragility

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,120
of those exercising their right to

68
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,200
freedom of

69
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,400
peaceful assembly and association in the

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,399
digital age

71
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,760
we'll then conclude by answering your

72
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,760
your questions

73
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,679
so as our executive director brett

74
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,760
solomon announced during opening

75
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,519
ceremonies we're very pleased to launch

76
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,359
this report which was co-authored by

77
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:48,480
myself and peter

78
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,000
so what led us to write this report why

79
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,640
did we decide to write this

80
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,280
report now there are two motivating

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,518
factors

82
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,400
one which is probably very obvious to

83
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,560
you all

84
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,319
um but let's go into the first one which

85
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:02,720
is a little less obvious

86
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,000
we had access now haven't previously had

87
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,920
a dedicated thematic

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,239
focus to freedom of association and

89
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,319
assembly but we were quickly noting a

90
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,720
pattern in our work that this topic

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,760
is really very much intersected in all

92
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,519
that we do

93
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,640
so for instance the digital security

94
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,440
helpline provides 24 7 direct technical

95
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,359
assistance

96
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,519
to a lot of different groups including

97
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
activists and human rights defenders

98
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,480
we also have our keeper on coalition

99
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
which is over 220 organizations

100
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,000
from 99 countries around the world and

101
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,840
in their

102
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,040
their latest keep an eye report from

103
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,760
2019

104
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,480
we documented that the most commonly

105
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,959
observed

106
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,159
cause of internet shutdowns were

107
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:44,159
protests

108
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,239
so it was really this intersection of

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,079
our work that was juxtaposed

110
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,280
against this current global context that

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,959
we're in right now

112
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,439
you know the rise of internet shutdowns

113
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,560
worldwide the prevalence of unlawful

114
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,640
surveillance

115
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,840
increases in privatization where we're

116
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,159
seeing tech companies

117
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:01,760
focusing solely on the profit motive

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,920
instead of their users

119
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,359
and then finally the impact of the kovid

120
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,679
19 pandemic

121
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
so the topic for us really moved away

122
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,319
from this area of interest

123
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,439
and this pattern to become a necessary

124
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,518
priority

125
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,959
for us to hone in on this topic and

126
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,798
contribute to the discussion

127
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,399
from this digital perspective by

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:21,440
offering insights from our current

129
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:24,320
campaigns

130
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,440
and our initiatives and the current

131
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,639
global context

132
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,199
really presents this set of guiding

133
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,880
questions

134
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,199
of signposts that can guide us through

135
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,040
the discussion on these rights

136
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:36,560
where have we come from particularly

137
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,160
since arab spring

138
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:40,240
where are we currently noting the

139
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
momentum of the black lives matters

140
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:43,919
protests

141
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,520
both within and beyond u.s borders and

142
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:48,560
finally where are we heading

143
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,320
with the impact of covid19 so when

144
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,880
answering these questions the paper

145
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,040
contains

146
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,040
three separate chapters and includes a

147
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:57,360
series of recommendations at the end

148
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:59,280
for states for private sector and for

149
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,280
international institutions

150
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,119
so for right now i'll go briefly into

151
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,599
explaining the three chapters

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
and highlight some of the key aspects so

153
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,680
the first chapter was access

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,120
connectivity and internet shutdowns

155
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,199
and when we're speaking of internet

156
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,320
connectivity it's not just about access

157
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,880
to the internet

158
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,759
we're talking about access to open

159
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,520
secure

160
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,600
affordable and a stable internet

161
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,599
connection which is fundamental

162
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,240
to for the enjoyment of various human

163
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,759
rights and yet time and time again we

164
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,759
see governments around the world

165
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,600
that are impairing the exercise of these

166
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,280
rights including freedom of peaceful

167
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,919
assembly and association

168
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,758
by imposing internet shutdowns such as

169
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,560
this year's government mandated one in

170
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,479
ethiopia

171
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,120
for instance that are in violation of

172
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,400
international human rights standards

173
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:47,919
and 3.6 billion people worldwide lack

174
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,679
access to the internet

175
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,120
and this is concerning when we consider

176
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,199
from an international human rights

177
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,840
perspective the sustainable development

178
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,960
goals

179
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,039
particularly sdg 9c which calls on least

180
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,880
developed countries to bring everyone

181
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,479
online by 2020 well it's 2020 and we are

182
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,719
in the middle of a pandemic

183
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,758
where access to internet is vital to

184
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,919
save lives

185
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,919
so now more than ever there's a need to

186
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,719
mobilize this political will

187
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,080
to excel accelerate sdg targets because

188
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,160
the world is well behind

189
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,120
and we will miss this well-intentioned

190
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
target

191
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,479
and we can't forget also the various

192
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
digital divides that exist

193
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,520
along the lines of race gender

194
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:27,599
disability

195
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,198
and it's not just an economic fix

196
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
although noting we need to consider

197
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,280
economic social and cultural rights here

198
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,440
but we need to address the systemic

199
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,840
barriers at play

200
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,479
the second chapter goes into unlawful

201
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
surveillance and the right to privacy

202
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,520
we all know that privacy and anonymity

203
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,759
provides

204
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,799
activists and protesters with some level

205
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,720
of assurance

206
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,199
that they will not be identified

207
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:53,039
identified or subject to reprisals for

208
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,960
engaging in their protests

209
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,520
however the use of surveillance

210
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,479
technology to monitor individuals

211
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,919
and their activities both online and off

212
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,680
such as during the protest in hong

213
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:08,880
kong and india in 2019 triggers this

214
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,120
fear of identification and persecution

215
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,039
and it also creates a chilling effect

216
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
not only on freedom of assembly

217
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,639
but also those intersecting rights such

218
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,520
as freedom of expression

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,400
so this chapter goes in and highlights

220
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,198
some of the

221
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,638
uses such as imsi catchers hacking

222
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,000
social media accounts

223
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:30,240
spyware being used to also assessing how

224
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,560
mandatory sim card registration

225
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,599
and digital id programs are collecting

226
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,280
data including

227
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,520
biometric data and how that's impairing

228
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,599
these rights we also go a bit into the

229
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,639
discriminatory impacts on particular

230
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,240
groups

231
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:46,639
specifically regarding facial

232
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,280
recognition technology

233
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,360
and then finally the last chapter

234
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,840
focuses on the influence of the private

235
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,360
sector and online civic space

236
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,440
you know we time and time again we've

237
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,639
heard at all these rights con sections

238
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,280
that tech companies

239
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,120
hold extreme power over spaces where

240
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,520
these individuals are exercising their

241
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
rights

242
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
including the right to protest and in

243
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,479
light of this power

244
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,240
states often pressure tech companies to

245
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,919
disrupt internet access

246
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:16,160
remove content or hand in users data as

247
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,599
part of strategies to hinder

248
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,759
individuals rights to freedom of

249
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,080
peaceful assembly and expression

250
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,000
and transparency as reporting is

251
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,719
essential to monitor tech companies

252
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,280
activities

253
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,840
and for demand accountability i'd like

254
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,080
to know

255
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,159
on this this topic in particular myself

256
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:34,399
and many of my colleagues at access now

257
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,838
we were very moved by the fireside chat

258
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,760
discussion earlier today with the

259
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
president of color for change

260
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,039
posing thought provoking questions

261
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,320
regarding these platforms and their

262
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,000
responsibility

263
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,680
and it really reminded me of this one

264
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,360
quote that we have in the paper

265
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,800
which is thinking how we can rethink the

266
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,680
role of these platforms in these

267
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,519
companies

268
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,760
when they take credit for supporting

269
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,519
popular uprisings around the world

270
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,839
you have no accountability to their

271
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:59,920
users in the regulation of speech

272
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,760
and and the fireside chat also

273
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,199
rightfully noted that it's not just

274
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
about accountability

275
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:07,839
more must be done so with that being

276
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,240
said these are the three chapters i'll

277
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:12,240
hand it off now to my colleague peter to

278
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,800
highlight more of the case studies and

279
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,800
examples

280
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:21,680
thanks laura i would love to jump into

281
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,640
some of the recommendations and case

282
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,640
studies

283
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,240
i just want to emphasize a few things at

284
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,959
the start

285
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,080
that really underlie the thinking behind

286
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,719
the paper

287
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:33,839
and our contribution to the development

288
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
of this right

289
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:39,680
at this time and that those are three

290
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:41,680
first up this right applies online

291
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,439
you'll see this reflected in the new

292
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,839
general comment issued by the human

293
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,560
rights

294
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,519
committee on the rights of peaceful

295
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,920
assembly

296
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,040
association this right applies online as

297
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,800
offline

298
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,680
and as we all know during the covid

299
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
epidemic and the social distancing we

300
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,239
are

301
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,600
left in a place where in order to

302
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,240
connect with one another

303
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,360
in order to do our work and maintain our

304
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,200
livelihoods

305
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,640
and of course to participate in

306
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,360
collective action

307
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,399
we must use information and

308
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:18,079
communication technologies icts

309
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,320
and we rely on the internet so this rely

310
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,439
on this right also applies online as

311
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
offline

312
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,440
including to remote participation and

313
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:29,040
digital assemblies

314
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:31,279
uh this right also applies during crises

315
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,199
just because there is a crisis does not

316
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,399
negate our fundamental rights um the

317
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,680
crisis could be

318
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,120
a pandemic like covid it could be a

319
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,000
political crisis

320
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:42,480
um like demonstrations and that's one of

321
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,920
the

322
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,800
case studies in our paper looks at

323
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,040
the crisis currently in ethiopia

324
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,199
following the assassination of the

325
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:59,279
charismatic musician and leader um

326
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,000
desa and the protests and demonstrations

327
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:03,439
that took place

328
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,160
there did see violence erupt

329
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
with hundreds killed unfortunately the

330
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,079
response from the government

331
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:11,440
was to clamp down on the spread of

332
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,719
information

333
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
information saves lives during pandemics

334
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,880
it saves lives

335
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,720
during violent protests

336
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:26,399
and it saves lives when people

337
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,959
can't access emergency services and

338
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,760
we see this response of shutting down

339
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,800
the internet

340
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,079
uh as wholly disproportionate and

341
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,319
unnecessary

342
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,519
and actually unhelpful even during

343
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,600
crises

344
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,120
uh thirdly this right is fundamental

345
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:44,240
this right can't be a bridge

346
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:47,279
unless um done so

347
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,720
in an environment that is uh it is clear

348
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,240
that is open that is

349
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:52,399
showing that it's necessary in a

350
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
democratic society to interfere with the

351
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,399
right that its

352
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,399
interference is proportionate and

353
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,440
pursuant to law

354
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,120
and so we apply these these principles

355
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,440
when looking at these case studies

356
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,160
um so in addition to looking at internet

357
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,959
shutdowns like we saw in ethiopia

358
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,360
we looked across the world to hong kong

359
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,439
where

360
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
you know the world has been inspired by

361
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
this youth-led movement of the past few

362
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,200
years

363
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:21,120
especially where youth are innovating in

364
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,440
ways that are really necessary

365
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,800
to protect themselves their bodies and

366
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:28,480
their rights

367
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:31,279
they're innovating to combat increasing

368
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:32,639
police use of technology in order to

369
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:36,000
surveil

370
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,839
in order to stoke fear in the populous

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,839
and chilling effects that would

372
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,360
negatively impact the collective right

373
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,279
to protest

374
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,880
and so what they're doing is uh

375
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,880
responding in ways

376
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:49,519
to the police use of technology like

377
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,000
facial recognition technology

378
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,360
and uh covering their faces and and

379
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,480
their bodies

380
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,399
to prevent identification to uphold

381
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:01,040
their right to anonymity which is

382
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:02,800
essential to their safe and free and

383
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,639
open exercise of this fundamental right

384
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
to collective action

385
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:10,079
in hong kong we've seen a series of laws

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,680
that have been passed in order to strike

387
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:15,359
at this rate of

388
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:17,359
uh anonymity of anonymous uh

389
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,959
contribution to and participation in

390
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,839
public protests

391
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:23,040
and most recently striking out the rule

392
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,480
of law itself

393
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:29,040
um allowing warrantless surveillance and

394
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:31,040
harassment of protesters as we've seen

395
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,319
in the past few days

396
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,880
so this right is under attack

397
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:37,920
online as it is offline in places like

398
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,839
ethiopia

399
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:44,880
hong kong and then taking it home to

400
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,399
the united states where i am located we

401
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:48,880
have a case study looking at the

402
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:52,480
aftermath of the george floyd

403
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,439
murder at the hands of u.s police forces

404
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,480
that has reinspired the black lives

405
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,199
matter movement

406
00:13:56,480 --> 00:14:00,399
and we've seen a gain momentum over the

407
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,519
past couple months

408
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,519
and it in turn has been met by

409
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,680
unlawful and overbearing police

410
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,160
surveillance that makes use of all sorts

411
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,079
of digital technologies and tools

412
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,399
the story is still being written on all

413
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,439
three of these case studies

414
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:21,120
as surveillance works it's meant to be

415
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:21,600
kept hidden and secret and so often we

416
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,800
only

417
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:26,480
learn much later what actually

418
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,000
law enforcement authorities and states

419
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,160
were up to and

420
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,320
what the private sector was was helping

421
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:35,680
them to

422
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:39,279
to affect what sorts of measures

423
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,839
the state used through procurement of

424
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:43,519
tools and services from the private

425
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,800
sector and in the united states of the

426
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,279
last few months

427
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,959
there have been some revelations of

428
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,639
police circumventing for instance

429
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,638
warrant requirements

430
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:58,399
by buying data from private providers

431
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,720
like data miner police have a procured

432
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:02,480
sorry not just police but um federal

433
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,800
authorities including

434
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,079
customs and border protection apartment

435
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,240
part of the department of homeland

436
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,319
security have procured

437
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,639
services and devices like drones for

438
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,920
one purpose and then repurpose them in

439
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,880
order to monitor

440
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,719
and surveil peaceful protesters engaged

441
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:23,279
in legitimate exercise of their

442
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:25,120
human rights and constitutional rights

443
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,600
and

444
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,639
so this public-private partnership is

445
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,920
something that we

446
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:33,920
think merit some extra attention uh

447
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,360
so the third chapter of our of our

448
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,079
report deals with

449
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,079
uh the privatization of a lot of the

450
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:42,079
spaces and channels

451
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:43,359
tools and services that we depend on to

452
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,920
exercise our right

453
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,519
of peaceful assembly in the digital age

454
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,959
and provides recommendations to the

455
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,320
private sector but also to

456
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,839
international institutions and states on

457
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,880
how to interact with the private sector

458
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,240
in ways that

459
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:03,160
respect fundamental rights and ensure

460
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,480
anti-corruption anti-discrimination

461
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,800
pro-competition

462
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:09,199
and civilian oversight through

463
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,199
transparency and accountability

464
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,279
so yeah the recommendations run through

465
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,560
the case studies and build on them in

466
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:20,000
order to

467
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:23,040
direct states private sector

468
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:26,000
entities and international institutions

469
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
on how to best respect and protect this

470
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:30,959
right in the digital

471
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,759
age one last piece i wanted to point to

472
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,399
was

473
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,480
that as as we may mention the paper

474
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,839
largely focuses on the right to peaceful

475
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,320
assembly

476
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,040
looking at protests and demonstrations

477
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:45,120
you know whether spontaneous organized

478
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,480
but it also does speak a bit to our

479
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,800
right to associate

480
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,160
um and i think one place that we saw

481
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,880
this right

482
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:54,319
most directly distilled and put at risk

483
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,040
in the past year was

484
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,680
the proposed sale of control over the

485
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:01,199
dot org

486
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:04,720
domain space to a private equity

487
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,039
firm with no history no background of

488
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,839
of running such a important global

489
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,400
entity

490
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,280
the dot org space access now uses along

491
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,319
with

492
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,280
the ymca and wikipedia and all other

493
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,959
sorts of

494
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,879
public interest organizations and

495
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:23,280
entities activists and advocates

496
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,240
and this space was directly put at risk

497
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,959
by this

498
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,559
you know fairly shady deal for more than

499
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,559
a billion dollars

500
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:31,840
that was you know announced as if it

501
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,240
were

502
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,840
already packaged and sold without any

503
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,799
consultation with those directly

504
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:39,760
affected

505
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,039
uh in civil society and beyond and so

506
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:43,760
the world

507
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,879
quickly mobilized in our community and

508
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,879
far beyond

509
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:50,080
to save.org and this case study makes it

510
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,120
in and i think it

511
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:56,159
recognizes that our right to associate

512
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:57,520
also applies online and increasingly

513
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,480
depends on

514
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:02,639
open online spaces that hopefully can be

515
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:06,080
protected in the public interest

516
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,919
and with human rights by design

517
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,678
thanks thank you both for the overview

518
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,440
and the examples they certainly

519
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:15,120
shed light on the importance and the

520
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:16,880
challenges surrounding

521
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,559
peaceful assembly and association

522
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,559
nowadays

523
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:22,559
moving on to the questions as peter

524
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,240
illustrated technologies provide

525
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,799
governments and companies

526
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:28,080
with a variety of tools to undermine the

527
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,679
right to protest

528
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,600
by facilitating monitoring

529
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:34,480
identification intimidation

530
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,840
and prosecution of protesters when

531
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:38,320
facing these kinds of

532
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,918
repressive policy strategies what are

533
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,240
the tools producers

534
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,000
can use to protect themselves and to

535
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,720
circumvent these harmful uses of

536
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
technology

537
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,280
yeah that's a great question and i've

538
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,080
seen it being discussed a lot during the

539
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,160
writescon

540
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,639
online sessions and there's two that

541
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:58,000
come to mind so the first in terms of

542
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,520
when we're talking about internet

543
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,600
shutdowns you know the circumvention

544
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:03,039
tool of virtual private net networks

545
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,480
vpns

546
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,480
mentioned on a session yesterday

547
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,280
actually on connecting using other

548
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,520
platforms

549
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,280
through their country's domain to be

550
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,639
able to communicate in the face of an

551
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,960
internet shutdown

552
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,919
while noting the fact again about you

553
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,280
know

554
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:20,960
wanting access to affordable internet

555
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,480
affordability is definitely an issue in

556
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,559
that in terms of

557
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,320
surveillance different circumvention

558
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,559
tools you know we're really seeing a lot

559
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,639
of discussions on end-to-end encryption

560
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,678
using tools available such as whatsapp

561
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,799
and signal

562
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:38,160
um so that they can limit direct access

563
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:39,520
access to metadata and we're routinely

564
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,160
seeing these cited in sessions and i

565
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,360
think an important thing to note here is

566
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,400
to really ensure that there's the

567
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,559
training the education and empowerment

568
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:50,080
to accessing this information and

569
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,360
continuously

570
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:55,918
reusing these tools and i think one

571
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,959
um case study i want to highlight that

572
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,360
really you know was

573
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:01,360
impressive in how they organized around

574
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:03,280
this was the protesters in hong kong

575
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:05,280
um we saw that they were communicating

576
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:06,158
only via secure messaging apps at one

577
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:08,158
point in time

578
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,440
deleting conversations related to

579
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:12,240
protests and using

580
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,039
the pre paid sim cards not linked to

581
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,360
their personal

582
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,320
information so i think those certain

583
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:22,479
strategies are very helpful

584
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,720
yeah i would uh add that you know in

585
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:26,640
addition to the tools and services that

586
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:29,280
protesters use but not just protesters

587
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:32,960
anyone really who wants to

588
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:36,000
reduce their digital footprint and

589
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,080
you know keep confidential and uh

590
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,600
save their personal information but also

591
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:41,439
that of their community members in

592
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,918
addition to these tools and services you

593
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,320
know we

594
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,320
should think of the legal infrastructure

595
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,280
and the regulatory infrastructure as

596
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,918
also

597
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,360
protecting our our right to engage in

598
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,520
peaceful assembly

599
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,120
and everything from data protection laws

600
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,440
which you know should reduce the amount

601
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,840
of

602
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,679
information that um private sector

603
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,360
companies can amass and also

604
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:04,159
share with or even sell to public sector

605
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:06,240
entities

606
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:07,679
data protection laws have a role of

607
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,320
course surveillance reform

608
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
ensuring uh civilian oversight and you

609
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:14,320
know warrant requirements

610
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,480
we refer to the 13 necessary and

611
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,760
proportionate principles applying

612
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,200
international human rights logic

613
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:23,679
communication surveillance as important

614
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,880
and so data protection laws surveillance

615
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,000
rules

616
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:30,159
as well as protections on of course

617
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,960
speech and the content of our

618
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,960
communications

619
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,159
right these are very helpful uh inputs

620
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:43,440
and you mentioned peter the

621
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:44,400
regulatory framework that we need to be

622
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,720
in place

623
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:48,240
to protect assemblies and i would like

624
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,039
to move on to a more

625
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,720
institutional framework uh the report

626
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,559
puts forward recommendations to

627
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
international institutions and

628
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,879
throughout rightscon we have been

629
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:59,440
hearing from this

630
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:00,559
different special repertoires on how

631
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,039
they are

632
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,240
integrating discussions on the digital

633
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:07,440
age

634
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:08,480
into their mandates could you elaborate

635
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,400
on your views

636
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,919
on the importance of the engagement of

637
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,600
international organizations and

638
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:16,480
especially even special

639
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,000
procedures mandate holders in advancing

640
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,000
the respect for the rights to freedom of

641
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,880
peaceful assembly and of association in

642
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,880
the digital age

643
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:30,080
um yeah i mean as laura can attest i

644
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,200
think there's uh

645
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:34,960
been excellent work done recently um

646
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:36,720
first and foremost by the the mandate

647
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,400
holder on uh

648
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,000
the rights of peaceful assembly and of

649
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,679
association which we can speak

650
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,600
to i mentioned human rights committees

651
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,039
and that's the the only official body

652
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,678
that interprets the international

653
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,960
covenant

654
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,880
on civil and political rights um

655
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,840
that human rights committee did finally

656
00:22:52,880 --> 00:23:00,400
put out a new interpretation of

657
00:22:55,840 --> 00:23:03,678
of this right in its general comment 37

658
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,960
which just came out uh this week and

659
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:10,159
uh so there's yeah i think long overdue

660
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,919
development of this rights

661
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,919
but it's it's really on the work of

662
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:17,840
you know this the special opportunity

663
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:19,520
and others who are showing that

664
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,280
this right not only applies in the

665
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,960
digital age but it takes all sorts of

666
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:26,240
forms that we may not have

667
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:29,120
expected um and uh you know i think

668
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,960
it's really on our community to to show

669
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,840
the really creative and innovative ways

670
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,760
that

671
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,280
people are you know defying a lot of the

672
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,360
restrictions and

673
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,760
joining together even if it's not you

674
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,399
know what we usually think of as a

675
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,679
you know big picket with signs in front

676
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
of

677
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:46,080
congress

678
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:50,879
yeah and i just want to highlight also

679
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:52,559
just the importance of the un special

680
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,840
rapporteur is really joining together

681
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,520
you know when they issue

682
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,199
a joint statement when they're doing

683
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,440
these coalitions and

684
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,960
and recognizing the intersection of

685
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:02,240
digital technologies within their

686
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,600
mandate and also

687
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,600
the intersection of all these rights

688
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,000
together it's really powerful and so i

689
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
think

690
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,320
having more of that so that we can use

691
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:12,240
that in our advocacy

692
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,559
is really beneficial to moving this

693
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,559
forward

694
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:21,039
yeah just a quick um reminder

695
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,760
so if you have if the audience has any

696
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:24,720
questions

697
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,120
for laura or peter just put them in the

698
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,880
chat and i'll address them to them

699
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:32,000
and meanwhile um not related note to

700
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:34,720
what we are discussing

701
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,400
now uh the report contextualizes the

702
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:36,799
rights to freedom of peaceful assembly

703
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,039
and of

704
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:41,120
association in the broader international

705
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:43,120
human rights framework and we've been

706
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,959
uh seeing engagements engagement from

707
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:47,279
special repertoires for example and oh

708
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,919
it's hr in this topic

709
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:53,279
why did you choose to analyze this topic

710
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,279
from the human rights lens

711
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:00,480
i think peter was mentioning that

712
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,240
briefly and one of the answers but

713
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,559
really we're looking at it from this

714
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,880
lens um in terms of you know

715
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,480
a lot was happening at the un level we

716
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,320
saw you know the general comment number

717
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,799
37 just came out today

718
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,439
ohchr had released a report that was

719
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:15,679
assessing

720
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,720
digital technologies and the right to

721
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:18,880
protest

722
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,000
all the human rights council resolutions

723
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,880
on civic space

724
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,919
on the right to protest and also

725
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:26,320
intersecting rights

726
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:28,000
such as freedom of expression so we

727
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,720
really wanted to provide an overview

728
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,760
of this and update it um for really for

729
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,960
advocacy

730
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,440
um noting that if doing an assessment

731
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:39,360
on on this issue you know having just

732
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,240
the international level

733
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,199
wouldn't be a good soul focus so we did

734
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,600
want to highlight

735
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,760
those domestic case studies and also

736
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:50,080
regional perspectives as well

737
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:53,919
in order to ensure that people have a

738
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,918
full picture of what's going on

739
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,480
yeah absolutely i think i would add that

740
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,159
you know we've seen

741
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:02,240
um and we've worked closely with

742
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,200
partners from and based in the global

743
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:06,000
south who

744
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,799
i particularly know that um this right

745
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,919
is

746
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,720
is broadly respected and affirmed in all

747
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,440
sorts of

748
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,400
regional and national instruments and so

749
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,640
approaching this

750
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,840
from a human rights perspective and

751
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,559
standpoint is

752
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:22,240
is really key to show that um this right

753
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,158
applies globally i think it makes even

754
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:27,120
more sense in the digital age

755
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,919
when it's so easy to form associations

756
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,719
and

757
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,600
to assemble across borders using these

758
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,840
tools

759
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:36,639
and again it's something that hasn't

760
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:38,639
been quite so developed and

761
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:41,120
i guess in a good sense maybe not quite

762
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:44,400
as politicized as the right to freedom

763
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,399
of expression for example

764
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,559
great uh and now bringing the discussion

765
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,320
to uh

766
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:52,000
the health crisis that we are going

767
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,678
through currently

768
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,279
as you mentioned in the report the kobe

769
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,039
19 pandemic is

770
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,400
changing the way we interact with

771
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,158
society

772
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,679
as well as the way we exercise civil

773
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:02,799
rights uh and this

774
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,039
includes the rights of freedom of

775
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:07,679
peaceful assembly and of association

776
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,279
as the traditional forms of physical

777
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:11,919
social gatherings are no longer

778
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:14,559
possible how do you see the impact of

779
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:16,080
the kobe 19 pandemic on the exercise and

780
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:16,879
the protection of freedom of peaceful

781
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:21,840
assembly

782
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
in the long term if any

783
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,399
i think i think yeah anyone can answer

784
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:30,000
that it's it's really um

785
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:31,760
it's really happening before our eyes

786
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:35,360
and you know beneath our fingertips

787
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:36,000
um yeah i i i hope that in the long run

788
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,918
this uh

789
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,840
this redoubles and there's some evidence

790
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,440
that it has redoubled the

791
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,480
attention to connectivity to access

792
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,080
to affordable information and

793
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:49,919
communications technologies that's

794
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:52,320
devices services

795
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:53,600
but also of course the literacy and uh

796
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,760
the the culturally

797
00:27:53,600 --> 00:28:00,719
relevant content and services

798
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:01,360
that are available to us and there's

799
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,520
really

800
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,959
one need and that's for funding uh to

801
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,480
bring the next

802
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:08,000
you know three and a half billion four

803
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:11,120
billion online

804
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,799
in a meaningful way and uh that is

805
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,600
something that i don't think anyone can

806
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:18,158
ignore

807
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:22,080
is a necessity in this covit 19 pandemic

808
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:24,960
and will become no less important

809
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,960
as we move forward

810
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:34,879
laura sorry do you want to add something

811
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,200
uh no i think peter summarized it quite

812
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,760
well um just to add that you know

813
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,440
you know as it really in the paper you

814
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,559
know the aftermath that we have with

815
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:44,559
covin

816
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,678
um it's going to have a triple effect

817
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,639
and i think

818
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,360
going back to you know sdg 9c i think

819
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,279
that was

820
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:52,639
um kind of one of the main things that

821
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,039
we were pushing is to

822
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,480
really mobilize this political will

823
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:59,840
around internet access

824
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,840
particularly in covid

825
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,159
uh we are approaching the end of this

826
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:05,120
press conference and i have one final

827
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:08,000
question to

828
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,039
each of you for your closing remarks uh

829
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,760
first peter

830
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,360
what do you what do we need to work on

831
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,960
to advance the respect

832
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:16,719
for the rights to freedom of peaceful

833
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,000
assembly and of association in the

834
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,480
digital age

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,640
what are the pressing challenges right

836
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,640
now

837
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,640
thank you um as as i mentioned i think

838
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,240
uh internet access into into the home

839
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:34,559
not just into the workplaces and the

840
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,960
schools and the public plazas that we

841
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:37,840
have

842
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:40,000
made some progress on but um really

843
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:43,120
meaningful broadband access to the home

844
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,399
that's not discriminated that's

845
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,678
respecting net neutrality and that is

846
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:50,080
endowed through you know really

847
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:52,399
affordable services

848
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,439
that's that's key uh you know once we

849
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,158
have that

850
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,240
i think you know well certainly we can't

851
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,240
wait until that comes about but

852
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,960
um i think looking much more deeply at

853
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,559
the

854
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,799
relationship between the state and the

855
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,039
private sector with respect to this

856
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:10,399
right is key is we make it up the point

857
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,399
in the report that

858
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,840
um facebook really has an outsized

859
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:17,120
influence whether it's through its

860
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,240
um whatsapp groups uh

861
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:20,479
you know which i think we're all

862
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,360
probably a part of

863
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:24,480
as well as um instagram but of course

864
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:26,320
facebook's

865
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,399
groups and pages which number in the

866
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:32,320
millions or uh hundreds of millions

867
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:35,360
um that is that is a massive

868
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,918
uh driver um of this right in the

869
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,600
digital age it's also a place where

870
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:41,120
as we've heard quite clearly over the

871
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:44,799
last few days

872
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:47,918
people suffer undue discrimination

873
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:50,000
and arbitrary and really blatant

874
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,600
restrictions that don't comport with

875
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,640
international human rights law

876
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,320
so it's it's looking at the

877
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,919
exercise of this right on private

878
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,760
platforms um

879
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:02,799
and then you know trying to ferret out

880
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,480
the relationship between states

881
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:06,639
and those and those private platforms

882
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:10,720
and then another act of private actors

883
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,720
and uh advancing respect for this right

884
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,480
and now so we can leave on a more

885
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,360
positive note

886
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:18,000
uh laura what do you see as hopeful in

887
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,240
the current

888
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:22,159
or future scenarios of freedom of

889
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
peaceful assembly and of association in

890
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,640
the digital age

891
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,840
thanks carolina this is a great question

892
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:30,320
and i think really

893
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,279
speaks to what was being discussed at

894
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:34,320
voulez's

895
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,919
um webinar um earlier this week

896
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,519
and i think you know really what's been

897
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,679
happening is you know these

898
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,279
movements have been very powerful and

899
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,240
there's been a lot of positivity that's

900
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:44,320
come out of this

901
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:46,399
you know for instance the the un human

902
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,879
rights council resolution

903
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:51,120
that led to led by the african group you

904
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:54,480
know judicial decisions against internet

905
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,479
shutdowns in indonesia and at equos

906
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:58,720
and laws on police use of surveillance

907
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,600
tech as enacted by the new york city

908
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
council

909
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:03,439
um so i think you know there is really a

910
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,360
lot of hope and momentum

911
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:08,000
and and just really to encourage people

912
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:10,559
to to keep exercising their rights and

913
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,480
and forms of solidarity i think you know

914
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:13,360
