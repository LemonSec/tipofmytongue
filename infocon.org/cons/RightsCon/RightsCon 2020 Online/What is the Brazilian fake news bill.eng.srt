and research institutes

25

working in three main themes digital

26
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,039
access

27
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,640
privacy and freedom of expression and

28
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,000
which has been a key player in the

29
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,240
discussions involving the fake news bill

30
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,320
so today we will debate both the

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
positive and negative aspects of the

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:22,720
draft bill of the brazilian law

33
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,520
of freedom liability and transparency on

34
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,240
the internet

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,439
the so-called fake news bill introduced

36
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,520
on april 1st

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:31,679
it is an attempt to hot this information

38
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:33,280
and viralization of content deemed

39
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,439
harmful online

40
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,560
on the discussion in in the middle of a

41
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,158
global pandemic

42
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
with the brazilian congress working with

43
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
us expedited procedures

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,000
civil society organizations and experts

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,759
on the matter have faced an increasing

46
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
challenge for their participation in the

47
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,119
debate

48
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,720
the bill has already been approved in

49
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,040
senate in a tight voting

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,280
and is now being debated debated in the

51
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,159
presenting house of representatives

52
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
criticism over the bill has been mostly

53
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,960
related to

54
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
threats posed to the exercise of the

55
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,320
rights to privacy and freedom of

56
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,399
expression

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,679
due especially to provisions on the bill

58
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,640
regarding traceability of communications

59
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,319
and messaging applications and mandatory

60
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,359
identification requirements

61
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,440
after the receiving of any complaint

62
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,760
on the other hand measures for larger

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,680
transparency obligations and activity of

64
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,399
platforms have been regarded as a

65
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,360
positive

66
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,200
outcome of the bill prior to introducing

67
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,760
our participants i would like to give a

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,760
shortened

69
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,399
overview short overview about the

70
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,519
platform's liability regime in brazil

71
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,360
explain is important uh due to the

72
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:40,959
increasing debates in our country that

73
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,720
such a regime

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
perhaps would not work and should be

75
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,359
transformed by a fake news bill

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,040
that's that that has been argued by some

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,239
i will try to do that in one or two

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,079
tweets

79
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,160
under the brazilians internet civil

80
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
framework an internet service provider

81
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,480
should only be held accountable

82
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:00,319
for the content shared by a third party

83
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,319
in case it does not follow a judicial

84
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,879
decision determining that the content

85
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,518
should be excluded from the platform

86
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,200
this provision was put in place in 2014

87
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,480
when notice and takedown was a common

88
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,958
feature in brazil

89
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:14,000
afraid of being held liable for users

90
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,400
content

91
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,239
providers prefer to frequently take down

92
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:21,440
websites and posts under any

93
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,519
large or small complaint

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,840

to to kick off this

155
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,880
part of my intervention by saying that

156
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,719
this regulation comes in a time in which

157
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
the majority of countries

158
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,639
are considering stronger regulation for

159
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
social media platforms and product

160
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,840
messaging apps

161
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,119
in order to hold disasters accountable

162
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,280
for the allegedly influence in

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,039
democratic systems and processes

164
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,359
such as the case of the consolidated

165
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,400
whatsapp influence in the brazilian 2018

166
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,800
election

167
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,280
this draft bill also represents a change

168
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:49,680
of the internet regulation mindset

169
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,520
in brazil and more importantly to dvg

170
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,960
build around the civil rights framework

171
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,719
for the internet

172
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,479
the internet with the internet being

173
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,960
besieged by disinformation

174
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,280
harassment and threats of violence this

175
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,840
resulted in users politicians different

176
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,000
influencers and even parliamentarians

177
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,119
demanding new legislation to protect

178
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
themselves towards

179
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,360
infringement of their fundamental rights

180
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,120
by the platforms themselves

181
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,440
therefore it is therefore it's possible

182
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,720
to say that draft bill to 630 is part of

183
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
the do something

184
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,720
and do something new tools backed up

185
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,560
backed up i just generalized on the

186
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,680
satisfaction with big tech and how they

187
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,440
have been handling

188
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
the design of these platforms that

189
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,440
ultimately also profit with hate

190
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,039
but starting with the good parts of the

191
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,400
draft deal i would like to point out

192
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,919
that um this is this

193
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,080
last approved version the approved

194
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,680
version under discussion right now at

195
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,919
the house of representatives

196
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,840
god is right in some points when it

197
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:43,198
addresses topics such as platform

198
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,919
transparency

199
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
sets obligations for trimester

200
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,240
transparency reports

201
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
disclosure of contractors of targeted

202
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,520
political

203
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,919
content and even when attempting its

204
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,198
first take on ensuring users due process

205
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,280
and right to appeal

206
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,560
most of the cases of product moderation

207
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,159
practices

208
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
acknowledging that there is a power

209
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,840
imbalance between social media platforms

210
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,360
and its user is key

211
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,359
when dealing with the spread and this

212
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,720
information that drafts those provisions

213
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,880
regarding users

214
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:15,120
right to appeal are relevant due to the

215
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,000
fact that they allow us to reinforce the

216
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,319
need

217
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,319
for proper reporting tools on the case

218
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,759
of weaponization of social media against

219
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,680
vulnerable groups

220
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,680
besides that addressing the lack of

221
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,919
clarity and transparency in content

222
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,080
moderation rules is also necessary

223
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,919
we need those rules to be comprehensive

224
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,639
with regards to the many contextual

225
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,198
nuances

226
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,199
of language and expression and even less

227
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,319
responsible for interfering on public

228
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,639
speech

229
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,560
on that note um empowering users and

230
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
providing them with the right mechanisms

231
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,039
and tools

232
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,360
such as the right to appeal content

233
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,318
moderation decisions access to remedy

234
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,560
remedies

235
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,639
regarding proper removals and even more

236
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,039
transparency about content moderation

237
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,840
rules is definitely key

238
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,400
starting with the bad side of the draft

239
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:00,080
deal

240
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,239
there are some provisions who are

241
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,878
worrying and those positions are

242
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,199
regarding

243
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,039
abstract abilities so what i'm saying is

244
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,080
that they are regarding the retention of

245
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,159
forwarded

246
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,120
message metadata and users

247
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,520
identification

248
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
on the case of complaints in authentic

249
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:17,680
or automated accounts

250
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
and these are still as i said a point of

251
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,199
concern due to the fact that they do not

252
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,119
comply with data protection principles

253
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:25,919
such as necessity and purpose

254
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,400
leading to practice of mass surveillance

255
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,840
by imposing compulsory data retention of

256
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
who talks to who

257
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,279
which data is what will have to be

258
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,880
retained until the message does not

259
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,159
reach the proposed requirements for

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,838
going viral

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:39,919
the the approved version of the draft

262
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:41,680
view ended up being populated by a

263
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:44,319
rather punitive approach to internet

264
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:46,479
users addressing everyone as potential

265
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,720
malicious actors and subverting ideas

266
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,720
such as the presumption of innocence

267
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,000
another issue is that the draft bill

268
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,080
gives police

269
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,680
police power to platforms to request

270
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,760
user identification

271
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,120
in particular cases and this might open

272
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,279
the margin to abuse

273
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,640
inlet platforms reaffirmed practices of

274
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:05,360
data capitalism

275
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,920
in which the more info they have on them

276
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,120
more than

277
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,839
they profit so instead of seeking to

278
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,680
increase

279
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,240
user databases and implementing

280
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,839
surveillance over private communications

281
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,839
um we believe that brazil should be

282
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,760
concerned with enforcing its recently

283
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:21,279
approved and not yet applicable

284
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
data protection law and also

285
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,880
implementing our dpas

286
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,719
in order for us to achieve the highest

287
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,760
protective mechanisms to the right of

288
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,480
projects right

289
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,000
for right to privacy um last but not

290
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,600
least we need to reconcile the

291
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,200
protection of personal data with the

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,480
freedom of expression and access to

293
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
information

294
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,880
the house of represents representatives

295
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:43,279
here should reject those provisions on

296
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,279
traceability and user identification

297
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,200
that might result in increasing private

298
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,880
surveillance over users and on the

299
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,279
massive and disproportional

300
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
collection of personal data as a remedy

301
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,200
to the malicious spread of this

302
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,760
information

303
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,040
and then i would like um to ensu bullet

304
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,760
points tweets

305
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,040
first of all we need to enforce data

306
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,519
protection frameworks

307
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
to be able to protect users from the

308
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,440
already practiced

309
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,959
abuses and privacy breaches and this is

310
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,640
part of a consistent strategy of

311
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,359
fighting this information

312
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,800
also um this path should be right and

313
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,360
human rights based

314
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:17,920
and there's a strategy have to configure

315
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,320
the need

316
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,399
to ensure users their right to appeal to

317
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,920
content moderation decisions

318
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:26,560
access to remedies and platform

319
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
transparency um i'll stop here

320
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,160
and just so i'll give the to my

321

in the digital environment

as components of quality

00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,279
we are at the forefront of the

343
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,800
legislative process

344
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:33,200
regarding this directive i would like to

345
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,760
take

346
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,160
a further approach on these two

347
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,079
highlights

348
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,360
actually we are seeing bruno actually at

349
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:46,880
the main camera

350
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:50,079
is that correct okay thank you

351
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,839
so i'm not on your voice so

352
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:56,000
uh we as long as

353
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,160
with coding rights are at the forefront

354
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,680
of this legislative process regarding

355
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,160
these drugs

356
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,760
i'd like to take a further approach on

357
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,880
these last two highlights

358
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:08,839
just pointed by bruno first

359
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,560
data protection and communication

360
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:13,760
secrecy as

361
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:16,079
main tools for fighting this information

362
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,519
and second place as it concerns to

363
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,079
online platforms

364
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,079
the value of transparency and

365
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,880
substantive

366
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:26,079
due process in content moderation

367
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,399
decisions

368
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,439
starting from the late the outlying

369
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,079
council

370
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,120
shows itself as a good measure to keep

371
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:36,399
the legislation

372
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:37,600
as strong as it needs to be at the same

373
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,880
time

374
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:43,600
he not only limiting itself to one

375
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:45,360
or another online service it only would

376
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,399
need to have some improvements

377
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:51,680
in its composition and a little revision

378
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:56,079
in the expected assignments

379
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,920
so also the law does the right thing

380
00:12:56,079 --> 00:13:00,399
when it sets online platform

381
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:03,599
requirements for moderating content

382
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:07,519
it does not forbid nor obligate rather

383
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:08,560
authorize and regulate the small list of

384
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,040
exemptions

385
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,719
are the negative vulnerable points of

386
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,160
article 12

387
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:17,200
but representatives as we expect to hear

388
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,560
from

389
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:23,440
philippe igoni seems to be already aware

390
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:25,119
of what would be needed in order to

391
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,600
ensure free speech

392
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
and avoiding any kind of chilling

393
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,360
effects

394
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,240
without embarrassing any moderation that

395
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,279
might come to be a parental

396
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,440
and for the second highlight i repeat

397
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,639
data protection and communication

398
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,519
secrecy

399
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,240
the text approved by senate has measures

400
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,839
about

401
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,800
traceability which manifests a lot of

402
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:51,920
good intent

403
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,160
in ensuring minimum user rights

404
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,079
in addition to committing itself in

405
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,639
general through brazilian dot

406
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,279
brazilian general data protection law

407
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:05,760
and to marcus review the internet

408
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:09,120
i can point first paragraph of article 8

409
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:12,160
and 6th paragraph of article 13

410
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,839
as concrete provisions aimed

411
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:18,800
not to weaken data protection

412
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:20,800
while regulating the suspension of

413
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,079
social media accounts

414
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:28,560
and reports production by the

415
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:32,160
the text on the other hand article 10

416
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:34,319
is altogether contestable when trying to

417
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:37,000
restrain this information to become

418
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,399
viral under the so-called

419
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,680
mess-forwarding

420
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:45,040
record-keeping this prediction

421
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:48,479
uh subjects the population as a whole

422
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,800
to a high risk in the face of possible

423
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,160
abusive requirements for personal

424
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,279
information

425
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:59,519
measures of misuse of their data

426
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:03,519
by companies and event or leaks

427
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:09,040
everyone's data will be mandatory saved

428
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,040
by the applications for at least 15 days

429
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:16,160
and during that time during that period

430
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,519
every message will be compared

431
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,000
to all the other messages in order to

432
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,839
see

433
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,279
if they fit into the mass forwarding

434
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:30,240
hypothesis all people who

435
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:31,360
for any legitimate or involuntary

436
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:34,480
reasons

437
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:38,240
participate in the the

438
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:41,920
after uh uh after verified

439
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,480
chain of mass forwarding

440
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,360
uh under the content sharing such

441
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
journalists

442
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,920
researchers parliamentarians and

443
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,560
any citizen whoever eventually forward a

444
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:55,920
post

445
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,279
even in order to denounce it will be

446
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:02,479
who have the records kept

447
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:05,199
all messages that circulate more

448
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,639
in messaging apps will be considered a

449
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,319
priori suspicious

450
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:13,759
interact without any indication of

451
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:15,199
a legacy on the other hand if a message

452
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,560
is not followed by

453
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:21,680
five but for at maximum

454
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:24,638
four senders or one sender

455
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,560
its record its records will not be kept

456
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:30,079
even though it might reach

457
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:32,160
10 000 receivers another worry

458
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,120
in case of a judicial process if over

459
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,000
any content

460
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,120
you'll be duty of people evolved to

461
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,279
explain

462
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,199
their no relationship with any

463
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:44,399
disinformation dissemination

464
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,120
it is a serious threat of uh the

465
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,000
principle

466
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,759
of innocence presumption and yes it can

467
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,680
impact the exercise of freedom of

468
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,880
expression and communication

469
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:57,519
in private messaging applications that's

470
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,519
it for now

471
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,160
well thank you so much paul henna thank

472
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:04,880
you for your your explanation

473
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,359
uh well it has been a a key issue of

474
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,679
this

475
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:09,520
of those draft bills discussions related

476
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,600
to especially traceability and

477
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,079
identification that both hanai

478
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:15,438
and bruno talked about uh but i think

479
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,839
that

480
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,160
now as soon as we as we hear from monica

481
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,359
we will have another perspective on it

482
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,640
so monica huizena uh

483
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:30,159

to be here today um i think hannah is

492
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:53,520
still on the main camera should we

493
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:56,960
get that changed i'm still on camera

494

495
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,678

496
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:06,160
stuff on my bed okay

497
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:10,320
um so first of all um i think that the

498
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:13,200
um the the idea of this panel was for us

499
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:14,080
to talk both about the positive um and

500
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,799
also the

501
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:18,399
the negative aspects of the bill and i

502
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,080
would love to start by

503
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:25,200
um by you know the great parts of it

504
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,320
um so um i start by congratulating the

505
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:29,039
brazilian congress

506
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,600
especially the lower house for being so

507
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:33,120
open

508
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:36,080
to debating the bills texts on such an

509
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,959
inclusive manner myself and several

510
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,000
other

511
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,480
industry colleagues we have been able to

512
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,080
participate on several public hearings

513
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,120
throughout the past

514
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:49,918
couple of weeks um and

515
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:51,678
it's been amazing to to see how open

516
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
congressmen and congresswomen

517
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,440
are to to our arguments and i think

518
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,080
that's where

519
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,240
the really democratic conversations

520
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:02,559
happen right when we disagree and when

521
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:03,760
we're able to put all of our ideas on

522
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:07,600
the table

523
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:08,000
um we re we do recognize um at facebook

524
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,480
that

525
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,200
the the current text shows significant

526
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,760
improvement

527
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,679
especially when we compare it to the

528
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,039
first versions that we

529
00:19:15,679 --> 00:19:19,840
that we saw back then um however we feel

530
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,960
that there is

531
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:26,399
still room for a lot of improvement and

532
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,640
it is my um my hope that

533
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,720
um from an industry perspective

534
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,760
especially facebook that i can

535
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:35,360
contribute a little bit um to to this

536
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,400
conversation

537
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:44,000
um so we do know

538
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:46,559
that the you know this bill arises from

539
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,679
huge fear of misinformation and

540
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,678
disinformation

541
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:52,240
and fake news and what it does to

542
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,720
democracy so we do understand

543
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,600
that um you know it comes from a good

544
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,320
place right

545
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,480
it tries to fight something that as a

546
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:03,600
society we recognize that

547
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:06,480
that's not great um at facebook we also

548
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:08,719
recognize that misinformation is an

549
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,559
issue and it's an issue that we take

550
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,960
extremely seriously

551
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:15,120
um throughout the past couple of years

552
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,799
and not just now i think that's very

553
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,280
important to highlight

554
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:21,039
we have been taking as a company several

555
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,158
steps to fight

556
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,440
misinformation in our platforms um our

557
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,679
main approach

558
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,679
is something i think everyone on this

559
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,440
panel have heard me talk about it

560
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,280
a million times but i know there are

561
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,960
lots of people watching that are not

562
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,760
familiar with it so i'm gonna

563
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,400
go ahead excuse myself and just say it

564
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,440
again

565
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:44,559
but we use our remove reduce and inform

566
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:47,280
approach um we remove content

567
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,720
that goes against our policies and we've

568
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:52,080
heard a lot of criticism

569
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,360
over how we develop and how we enforce

570
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,280
our policies and i

571
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:57,199
i we don't have a lot of time but i just

572
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,320
want to make sure to highlight that the

573
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,640
reason why we have

574
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,158
policies in place and we enforce those

575
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:08,559
is mainly amongst you know the top

576
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:11,200
priorities is safety

577
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:13,918
it's extremely important for us as a

578
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,400
platform to keep people safe

579
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:17,039
people will not be using our services if

580
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,880
they're not

581
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:20,400
they don't feel that they're safe so

582
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,960
safety has a huge

583
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:25,200
it plays a really really huge role in

584
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,159
how we develop and how we enforce our

585
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,880
policies

586
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,480
um and just for instance of you know

587
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,760
things that we remove

588
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,080
certain types of um of uh content such

589
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,559
as

590
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,399
child exploitation for instance that's

591
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:39,360
that's the type of content that we do

592
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,760
not allow we have

593
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,439
zero tolerance for we also remove

594
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:46,640
millions of fake accounts

595
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:49,679
every single day on the reduce

596
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:53,039
part we try to reduce

597
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:56,559
the reach of low quality information

598
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:59,360
such as fake news and the reason why

599
00:21:56,559 --> 00:22:02,399
we're not removing fake news

600
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,080
we're reducing reach is because we don't

601
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,159
want to be put in a position to be the

602
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,559
arbiters of the truth if we were to say

603
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:10,159
that we remove fake news we would need

604
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,120
to be in that position

605
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,320
and i don't think anyone wants any

606
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,280
private company or

607
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,399
government telling us what is true and

608
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,960
what is false

609
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,799
so in order but we do realize and we do

610
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:24,480
recognize that that's a problem

611
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,400
so we work with third party fact

612
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,520
checkers around the globe we now have

613
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
over 56

614
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,720
um fact-checking agencies all accredited

615
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,000
by pointer which is an international

616
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,120
organization

617
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,600
working with us um and

618
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,559
um and they are the ones who send a

619
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,039
signal that

620
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,080
content is fake back to us and that way

621
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,080
we

622
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:48,320
are able to reduce the reach of that

623
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,480
content in our platforms

624
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:52,480
and with that we also inform people and

625
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:53,120
that's the third pillar of our strategy

626
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,280
right

627
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:56,959
we let people know that this is this

628
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,720
content was fake

629
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:01,120
it was marked as fake by this

630
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:02,080
organization this is the methodology

631
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,520
behind it

632
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:08,799
um do you still want to post it

633
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:11,280
we're currently now putting filters on

634
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,799
on on on content that has been flagged

635
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:15,840
as false and we

636
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,720
we know that people um on kovid

637
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:20,639
related false news for instance 95 of

638
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,720
the people who have seen it

639
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:24,400
with a filter they didn't pass they

640
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:26,480
didn't click past

641
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,000
to actually look at that content so

642
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,120
that's very very significant

643
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,080
uh significant for us um and um and that

644
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,439
um i really wanna that's just an

645
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,080
introduction to say that

646
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,039
we're not against regulation our our

647
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,399
founder mark

648
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:46,480
has been really vocal about it um

649
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:48,080
um um on on several occasions we've

650
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,600
we've talked about it we've written

651
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:53,360
about it

652
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:56,158
but i would say i would argue that we

653
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:57,918
we do not support any regulation that

654
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,120
may hinder value such as

655
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,039
innovation or free speech

656
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:05,520
and that is why we do have some

657
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:07,279
criticism to this particular bill

658
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:08,960
because we do believe that some of it

659
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,919
might

660
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,039
more directly or even indirectly affect

661
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,279
such values

662
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:17,760
um and then i have a specific

663
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,000
contribution on article 17

664
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:21,440
of the proposed view and that's an

665
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,360
article that requires

666
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,080
uh that any and all advertisers on

667
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:28,719
facebook

668
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,360
provide a valid id document in order to

669
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:34,320
be able to advertise

670
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:36,240
and we feel that that can be complicated

671
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,360
uh for several reasons and i'd say the

672
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,880
first one

673
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:44,080
is privacy right um

674
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,120
obliging people every single advertiser

675
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:48,799
to provide

676
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:52,080
an id that means having

677
00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:57,039
facebook collect and retain

678
00:24:52,080 --> 00:25:00,320
a massive you know even larger amount of

679
00:24:57,039 --> 00:25:01,919
information data and

680
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,000
you know if we go back to the language

681
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:06,320
of marco seville de internet

682
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,440
we'll you know we should remember that

683
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:11,120
companies you know

684
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:14,320
should not be collecting more data than

685
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:17,760
needed to provide their services

686
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:22,720
so we're definitely against that

687
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:22,720
it does defeat it doesn't necessarily

688
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,120
reach the purpose of the bill which is

689
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,760
to our understanding

690
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:30,719
finding people behind ads that are

691
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:35,760
deemed as

692
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,400
you know political or not great

693
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,840
the information we already provide such

694
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,720
as ip logs

695
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:44,639
and registration data when combined with

696
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:46,640
the information that

697
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:48,080
internet providers also are able to

698
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,880
provide to law enforcement

699
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:52,000
in the course of an investigation that

700
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,000
information

701
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:58,960
is already enough to be able to find

702
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,760
people behind certain behavior or

703
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,320
certain uh

704
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,960
content in our platform and more

705
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:06,960
important

706
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,520
to that point i'm almost closing um

707
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,080
we know we we know that covet 19 has put

708
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,039
the world

709
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:14,080
under tremendous economic strain now

710
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,640
more than ever

711
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:18,480
people need access to advertising tools

712
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:20,400
that can help them go through these

713
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:23,679
really really difficult times

714
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:24,640
and to add extra layers of unnecessary

715
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
paperwork

716
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,799
massive data collection and verification

717
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,600
from companies

718
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:33,918
will definitely slow the process down

719
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,879
and generate large economic impact we do

720
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,720
believe that

721
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,799
this provision has the potential to

722
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,720
affect millions of small businesses

723
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,279
and entrepreneurs specifically small

724
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:45,760
entrepreneurs who use our platforms to

725
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,320
advertise their services

726
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:49,919
we're not against more transparency we

727
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:52,240
already

728
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:54,159
have a lot of transparency in place we

729
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:56,480
believe that certain ads should have

730
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:58,000
more scrutiny from the public view

731
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:00,240
and i would just like to remind all of

732
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:02,559
you that we do have different policies

733
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,279
for political and issues ads

734
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,000
whenever an ad is political the public

735
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,760
anyone can

736
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:12,880
see who posted it who paid for it

737
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:14,480
it gets um it stays in our ads library

738
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,799
for such a long time

739
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,679
um it's useful for researchers for

740
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,559
academics

741
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,600
for authorities special especially local

742
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,960
authorities

743
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,240
electoral it's an unprecedented level

744
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,880
of transparency that facebook has set

745
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:33,120
for the industry and we do believe that

746
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
it's a matter of adjusting the text of

747
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:37,439
article

748
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,480
17 to make it specific to

749
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:41,600
political ads that being said i'm going

750
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,600
to wrap it up

751
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:45,039
just by saying that we do welcome

752
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,080
transparency we welcome more

753
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,919
transparency

754
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,520
but transparency measures they need to

755
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,559
be proportionate

756
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,960
um and uh the way article

757
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,760
17 is written up right now we don't feel

758
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,960
that it's

759
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,879
fulfilling it's um it's original

760
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,000
intent thank you so much and i'm sorry i

761
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:06,159

776
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:40,720
influence how this bill which has been

777
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,000
on the debate for

778
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:47,120
the past weeks and months and how

779
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:48,480
this can influence the region because as

780
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:51,039
you may know this is

781
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,600
not it's not the first time where in

782
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:56,000
face of a bill that has some problems it

783
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:56,959
has have some developments in all the

784
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,520
debate but

785
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,640
can that can also influence other

786
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,279
legislations

787
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,320
in the region and elsewhere so here i'm

788
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:06,320
talking to

789
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,439
you to the people who are not in brazil

790
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:10,559
who are outside

791
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:13,679
to to pay attention to what's happening

792
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,760
in the country so um as

793
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,679
the previous panelists have already

794
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,960
mentioned there are things that

795
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,600
um that are positive things and and

796
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,279
very about negative things the positive

797
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,240
things i'm just gonna highlight again

798
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:31,440
the transparency part is quite important

799
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:33,760
but again we are still have even though

800
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,679
the civil society civil society

801
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,760
organizations in brazil

802
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,279
have been working very hard you know to

803
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,960
push to put more

804
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:46,720
um more safeguards to to reduce

805
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,679
all those uh risks for human rights

806
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:50,799
we still have the retention of data from

807
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,440
one side

808
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:55,120
and we also have the user and getting

809
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:55,919
identification on the other side so we

810
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,320
have we

811
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:59,520
still have two provisions who are there

812
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,960
in the bill

813
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:05,360
and the problem is that the

814
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:07,520
the authors of this bill believe that

815
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,678
with this provision and with others

816
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:11,760
they can combat this information this

817
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:13,360
information is a problem that we still

818
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:16,480
have

819
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,399
that's part of of our everyday life

820
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,520
but it's also very important to

821
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:22,080
highlight that

822
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,039
it it gets really relevant on special

823
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:25,439
moments

824
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:27,360
and what but i mean uh with a special

825
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:29,520
moment for example are

826
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,120
like last year we had a lot of projects

827
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,799
happening in the region like many

828
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:35,360
countries in latin america

829
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,360
this year we are all facing this uh

830
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,158
kovid 19 crisis

831
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,000
and during this year and next year we're

832
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:44,559
going to have elections happening

833
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,279
in countries such as nicaragua el

834
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:49,039
salvador ecuador mexico maybe we'll have

835
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,080
the referendum in chile

836
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:55,279
also the one in bolivia those are

837
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,439
key moments where information plays

838
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:59,519
an important role and flow of

839
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,840
information also plays an important role

840
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,840
for

841
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,240
everyone and that's why we are very

842
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:06,399
worried

843
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,440
to have like a bill like this right now

844
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:08,879
in in

845
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,480
that is well now is in the chamber of

846
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,880
deputies and see

847
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:14,080
how this is going to develop in all

848
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:15,679
these days is

849
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:17,519
important to us but it's also important

850
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:18,799
to all the people who are watching us at

851
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:22,720
this moment

852
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:24,559
so that's why um i

853
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:26,080
uh jointly with the qualities on the

854
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:27,678
right

855
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,840
that is a coalition for the 40

856
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:32,720
organizations in brazil

857
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,840
we launched a campaign that's launching

858
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,519
today

the this is our campaign uh we're still

880
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:30,960
using

881
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,799
the hashtag samefakenews.com

882
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,000
that's the hashtag in english in

883
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,840
portuguese sorry

884
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,200
but this is the text in english you can

885
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,120
go there and read them

886
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,720
it's a very easy way to understand

887
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,678
what's going on the bill

888
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,320
why we don't like the traceability

889
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:47,360
neither

890
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,399
the user identification

891
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,799
provision and then we have tweets uh

892
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,518
already already written there but you're

893
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,440

894

edit them and drop them the way you want

895

to be talking to you right now about

935
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:41,759
such an important thing that we are

936
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,440
discussing

937
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,079
in the house of representatives here in

938
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:49,839
brazil well

939
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:52,879
my my my contribution here

940
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:56,480
is gonna be short you know i'm gonna

941
00:34:52,879 --> 00:35:00,000
talk maybe maybe three things

942
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,079
about the history of this bill and

943
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,040
positive points and negative points that

944
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:05,920
i think

945
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,480
there are right now in the bill first of

946
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:10,480
all

947
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:14,160
three months ago when me deputy tabeta

948
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:16,070
and senator alessandro we we

949
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:17,279
we actually put forward the bill

950
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:21,200
[Music]

951
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,880
we of course we knew the bill

952
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:28,879
wasn't uh as good as we

953
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,000
wanted it to be so we started a huge

954
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:32,960
conversation

955
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,520
with the the civil society a lot of

956
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:36,720
special

957
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:39,280
specialists i think it was more than 100

958
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:40,720
people and organizations that we we

959
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,000
talked with

960
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,359
so the the bill actually

961
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,119
had a few versions so

962
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:54,480
it evolved and it became a bit better

963
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:56,800
and the senate actually was faster than

964
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:58,480
the chamber of deputies to discuss it

965
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,880
and to improve it

966
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,599
so there are a lot of things that are

967
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,079
important

968
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,079
in the view and a few things that i

969
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,359
actually think that we need to change

970
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:11,680
and we need to improve first of all

971
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,960
the the positive things i think there

972
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:17,359
are maybe

973
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:19,760
four or five major positive points

974
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,279
in debut right now first of them

975
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,480
transparency

976
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,359
on the content moderation because we

977
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,839
already know

978
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,720
that the platforms do a lot of things

979
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:33,520
with the content that people post

980
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,240
and we need to know what they do what

981
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,920
they do

982
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:38,879
why they do and in which scale they do

983
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,520
it

984
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,720
and transparency in content moderation

985
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,800
for me

986
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,000
it is as important as transparency

987
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,119
for example in public accounts to combat

988
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:55,119
corruption

989
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:56,800
if we know better how our contents how

990
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:59,920
the things that we post

991
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,359
are actually moderated we can all we can

992
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,520
be

993
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,880
more empowered to combat this

994
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,480
information

995
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,640
the second point i think is very

996
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,680
important is transparency

997
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,118
and they sponsored content

998
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,720
because when we know that somebody

999
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,599
is is actually sponsoring a content

1000
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:22,560
is much more um how can i say it's much

1001
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,440
easier

1002
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,320
for the person to understand why that

1003
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:29,839
content

1004
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,440
reached the person so that that also has

1005
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:36,880
an impact on empowering the person

1006
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:40,720
the user of course and in combating

1007
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,160
this information in terms of

1008
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:46,319
um private messaging there is one point

1009
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:47,759
i think it's very very important is very

1010
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:51,520
positive

1011
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,640
there is diminishing the mass messaging

1012
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:58,000
you know when when we have messages sent

1013
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,520
to to a huge number of people this is

1014
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,480
very important

1015
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:04,640
because private messaging like whatsapp

1016
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,920
telegram and etc is for people to talk

1017
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,200
with people in groups

1018
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:13,520
individuals etc not

1019
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:17,040
for somebody or an organization

1020
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:19,280
to sponsor and to send messages to

1021
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,720
millions and millions of people so we

1022
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,720
can actually

1023
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:28,000
um protect the characteristics

1024
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:31,520
of few people conversation right

1025
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,920
if understood and there is a

1026
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,680
last point that for me is one of the

1027
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:37,440
most important ones

1028
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:40,078
which is the identification of the

1029
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,599
robots of the bots that we have in the

1030
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:44,240
internet

1031
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,960
because you know the false accounts and

1032
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,720
bots

1033
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:51,200
they are used to build false consensus

1034
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:52,319
on the internet and that has a huge

1035
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,960
effect

1036
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:57,520
on behavior of the people on behalf of

1037
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,160
the individual actually and also

1038
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,200
in the collective behavior and this is

1039
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,480
very important

1040
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:07,200
there's no problem with having a bot

1041
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,079
on the internet but there is a problem

1042
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,720
if that bot

1043
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,160
is not identified because the person can

1044
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,959
actually think

1045
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:16,799
that the account with which the person

1046
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,000
is talking with

1047
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
is actually a person but in in

1048
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:23,760
it many instances instances is not a

1049
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,920
person

1050
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:28,000
this is very important for me and i

1051
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,280
think these are the the four major

1052
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:32,640
positive points of the bill and there

1053
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:33,440
are a few points that we're actually

1054
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,960
discussing

1055
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,240
and we we will improve in the chamber of

1056
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:41,680
deficits

1057
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,720
well first of all now to

1058
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,279
provisions about private messaging

1059
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,759
that i think we're going to change it's

1060
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,839
it's

1061
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,880
not our consensus yet but i think it's

1062
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:53,040
going to change

1063
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,400
which is a provision about account

1064
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,119
suspension

1065
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,680
and the provision about traceability

1066
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:00,079
actually

1067
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:01,520
the last speaker talked about that a

1068
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,760
little bit too

1069
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,560
another thing that i think we we are

1070
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:07,200
going to

1071
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,400
to change is about identification of the

1072
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,680
users

1073
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,760
especially the point in which we ask

1074
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:18,879
the the platforms to identify users

1075
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:22,400
following another user's report

1076
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,040
that this would actually create a report

1077
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,359
war

1078
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,960
in which a lot of people would report a

1079
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:29,440
lot of other people

1080
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,960
and we would have a mass identification

1081
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,160
that's not all we want

1082
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,839
all right we want to identify

1083
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:38,480
bots and we want to identify false

1084
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:41,920
accounts so

1085
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,400
maybe these are the the major points

1086
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:46,079
that we are we're going to change of

1087
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,079
course it's not all

1088
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,400
but i think we have a very important

1089
00:40:48,079 --> 00:40:52,640
opportunity here in brazil

1090
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:54,640
to make a bill and a proof of you that

1091
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:57,759
is actually protective

1092
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:01,118
of freedom of speech and

1093
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:05,119
has a huge effect in combating fake news

1094
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:08,000
thank you very much thank you so much

1095
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:08,800
congressman thank you for accepting our

1096
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:11,920
invitations

1097
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,640
for to stay here and thank you for your

1098
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,119
for your awards in it well so we have

1099
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,879
some

1100
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,040
questions from the audience and i'm

1101
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,200
going to since we do not have much time

1102
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,680
left i'm gonna

1103
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,640
ask them for for specific participants

1104
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,759
and perhaps

1105
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,000
anyone who who intends to to share their

1106
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:31,119
their views on a thought and are also

1107
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,960
welcome

1108
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:34,960
so we have one question here from

1109
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:37,440
eduardo costa

1110
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,520
she's asking i would like to know if the

1111
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,800
main topic of this draft law is this

1112
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,200
information

1113
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:47,760
or if this bill will impact other issues

1114
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:48,799
perhaps congressman could you share some

1115
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,680
thoughts on this

1116
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,680
on this aspect

1117
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,279
congressman

1118
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,560
well i think perhaps he's off oh well

1119
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:08,720
anyone would like to

1120
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:11,279
to to talk about it perhaps

1121
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,279
monica

1122
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:18,079
would you like to dream

1123
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,319
so we uh actually we have to have a

1124
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,359
historical approach right uh

1125
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:31,599
the the view started in april

1126
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:32,960
uh regarding fake news and this

1127
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:36,079
information

1128
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,359
but at this moment uh

1129
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:40,000
we had this development that the draft

1130
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,400
bill

1131
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:47,359
uh is not anymore aiming to define

1132
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:48,720
this information are fake news even

1133
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:52,000
though the draft bill

1134
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,919
has this unique of

1135
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,880
fake news drive to do so it goes beyond

1136
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:59,839
the disinformation uh definition and

1137
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,119
aiming

1138
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,839
but it still has this uh uh

1139
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,960
main intention right to curb this

1140
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:09,839
information

1141
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,280
and help our democracy not only our

1142
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,279
election process

1143
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,560
but also the nowadays uh

1144
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:19,760
decision making for public sector and

1145
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:23,680
private sector

1146
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:27,040
and individuals but

1147
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,319
it goes beyond as it aims to

1148
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:32,000
to tackle uh transparency to to provide

1149
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,000
transparency

1150
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:39,119
uh under any

1151
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,640
any kind of content moderation

1152
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,640
so we have a more broad

1153
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:46,640
issue here but

1154
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,200
it is a resume it is a historical

1155
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,280
answer right it was about uh fake news

1156
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,480
in the beginning about this information

1157
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:01,440
but now it goes beyond and it really has

1158
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,000
impact

1159
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:04,640
other issues and that's what we are

1160
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,160
trying to

1161
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:11,279
to say due impact uh most of all uh

1162
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,920
transparency and also the due process

1163
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,960
not only for fake news but for any kind

1164
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,680
of content

1165
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:18,400
moderation that the platforms you have

1166
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:22,879
and it

1167
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:26,880
gives the public sector uh

1168
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:30,240
the lines are guidelines for what to do

1169
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:33,359
and that's what we that's why that's why

1170
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,799
we are so in favor of the

1171
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:40,880
concept for responsibility transparency

1172
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:42,800
in the internet i guess that's it

1173
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,160
okay thank you paulo thank you so much

1174
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,079
for your thoughts on it

1175
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:47,279
uh well we have one more question this

1176
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:50,560
one is from

1177
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,160
jason pillar meyer

1178
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:57,359
i think that's the way i can say that

1179
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,078
so uh it is if the law passed by the

1180
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:00,640
senate

1181
00:44:58,079 --> 00:45:02,640
were enacted without changes which

1182
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:03,359
messaging services would be covered by

1183
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:06,640
the law

1184
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:10,078
in which if any would not

1185
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,040
uh to some to the some

1186
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:15,359
would not be covered what if any

1187
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,880
principled reason distinguishes don'ts

1188
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:22,400
those well i i don't think i could

1189
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,880
understand it properly um

1190
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,560
but basically wow i think that you could

1191
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,960
share your thoughts on the impacts on

1192
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:30,640
messaging services then and which

1193
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,200
messaging services would

1194
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,960
would be affected by the legislation how

1195
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:37,439
would be a a proper

1196
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,560
i don't know maybe principled approach

1197
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,880
that we could

1198
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:41,920
move towards it that we could use to

1199
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:45,119
interpret

1200
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:48,400
uh the legislation or even another

1201
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:49,040
in case some specific service do not

1202
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:52,800
fall under

1203
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:54,079
its scope i think perhaps bruno could

1204
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:56,480
share some thoughts on it

1205
00:45:54,079 --> 00:45:56,480
with us

1206
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:02,240
of course um yes first of all it is

1207
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,520
important to mention

1208
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:07,598
that um this bill does not apply to

1209
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,280
any social networks or private messaging

1210
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:11,680
services that

1211
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,720
um have less than two million registered

1212
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:16,078
users so

1213
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:19,279
um that will be literally the one um

1214
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:22,319
safeguard slash on bar in dividing

1215
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:25,520
or even um distinguishing um each

1216
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,800
each and what um services are under the

1217
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,480
scope of this wall or

1218
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,000
which ones are outside the school books

1219
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:32,960
as well also

1220
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:33,599
um it is important to mention that um

1221
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:35,520
there is

1222
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:36,800
a lot of there i at least have a few

1223
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:40,079
concerns with the

1224
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:42,240
definitions um sat by this bill in which

1225
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:43,920
um they have the definition as a private

1226
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,240
messaging service

1227
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:48,079
as an internet application that enables

1228
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:50,399
the sending of messages to

1229
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:52,480
specific indeterminate receivers

1230
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:55,839
including those protected by end-to-end

1231
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:57,760
um encryption so pretty much that means

1232
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,680
almost all of the services we have

1233
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,240
available nowadays um

1234
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:04,078
and that is why and and i mean there is

1235
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:07,040
one exclusion on the bill um

1236
00:47:04,079 --> 00:47:09,200
towards um corporate use and also

1237
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,759
electronic mail services because

1238
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,000
i mean definitely will be a little bit

1239
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:16,480
of a bigger nightmare um regulating

1240
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:18,960
personal emails in this but also

1241
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:20,240
i would like to come back to my previous

1242
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:22,079
point about the fight against

1243
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,439
misinformation walking together with

1244
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:26,800
data protection

1245
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,160
because we know that as much as we

1246
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:30,960
understand that whatsapp can and was

1247
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,839
weaponized

1248
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,520
and used in the means of manipulating

1249
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,440
this course and manipulating the public

1250
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:39,599
space

1251
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,280
this type of false information um this

1252
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:42,960
information misinformation is also

1253
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,640
fabricated in order to

1254
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:46,480
cater to different profiles and

1255
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:48,400
personalities that are also built

1256
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,359
relying on all the data we already

1257
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:52,240
provide

1258
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,640
to those platforms so this is basically

1259
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,040
why

1260
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,558
um qualifier has been raising so many

1261
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:59,440
concerns about this and

1262
00:47:56,559 --> 00:48:01,520
we have been speaking so so much about

1263
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,720
the risks to previously and the risks to

1264
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:05,359
freedom of expression

1265
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,200
if we end up in a scenario where pretty

1266
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:08,558
much every single of these platforms

1267
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:11,118
will have to be

1268
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:12,640
monitored um pretty much um all of them

1269
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,839
will have together

1270
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,160
metadata and um and in the end of the

1271
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:17,680
day

1272
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,319
if they don't collect the sort of

1273
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:22,240
metadata from the person who

1274
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:23,839
sends and also the person who receives

1275
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:26,558
it um we will

1276
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:27,200
we will also result in a scenario that

1277
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:29,359
um

1278
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:30,799
maybe platforms such as signal or

1279
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,040
telegram won't

1280
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,040
won't be no longer allowed in brazil and

1281
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:35,680
then we will have to opt for the ones

1282
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:38,400
who

1283
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,240
kind of hindered privacy um in order to

1284
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:43,280
be compliance to the bill

1285
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,919
so uh in a little not so short week that

1286
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,200
was my

1287
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:50,240
my intervention thank you ben thank you

1288
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,118
it was perfect uh well perhaps monica

1289
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:54,078
would like to

1290
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:54,640
share her thoughts on the theme as well

1291
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:57,280
sure

1292
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,799
um well i cannot speak for other

1293
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:01,839
companies but um

1294
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:03,119
the bill certainly impacts all of the

1295
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,640
private messaging

1296
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:10,079
apps within facebook's um

1297
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:13,040
family of apps so

1298
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:16,000
we would be directly impacted by it i

1299
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:19,920
would just like to briefly comment on

1300
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:23,119
the 2 million user threshold

1301
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,240
and i believe the the concern

1302
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:28,640
it raises 2 million users might seem

1303
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:30,640
like a lot

1304
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:31,839
but it's not um if a company is

1305
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:35,118
successful it can

1306
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:38,480
very very quickly right in the beginning

1307
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:41,520
uh reach that threshold and still be

1308
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,599
really small and not have you know the

1309
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:46,240
deep pockets to invest

1310
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:47,680
in all of the requirements that the this

1311
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:51,439
bill puts forward

1312
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:53,118
so i do worry about um

1313
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:55,040
and that might seem a little bit odd but

1314
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:58,079
i do worry about um

1315
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:01,680
the bill killing space for

1316
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,319
new companies to uh to arise in the

1317
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,598
future

1318
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:08,480
right um i sure hope there is a new

1319
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:09,599
facebook in the future and uh um for

1320
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:12,240
especially for

1321
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:13,839
you know the small ones that might not

1322
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,000
be possible because

1323
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:17,759
you know we know the challenges that

1324
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:22,000
startup companies

1325
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:24,880
startup companies face also on

1326
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:26,800
on on the scope of the law which was

1327
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:30,079
something that you commented before

1328
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,200
we do understand that this bill came

1329
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:36,640
out of uh you know fear for what

1330
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:39,118
fake news could cause and i think um

1331
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,400
and we do recognize it we do understand

1332
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,720
it and i think it

1333
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:44,079
it comes from a really really good place

1334
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:48,480
transparency

1335
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:51,040
is is is amazing um more transparency

1336
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:53,040
is good for everyone but again it i

1337
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,079
think we need to think of proportionate

1338
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,640
measures

1339
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:57,359
that allow innovation to still flourish

1340
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:59,440
that allow

1341
00:50:57,359 --> 00:51:01,598
new companies to still come onto the

1342
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,000
market and and compete with each other

1343
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:08,240
that that's what drives innovation right

1344
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:10,079
um um and uh

1345
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,720
yeah i think i have so much to say but

1346
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:14,880
uh henato is looking at me with

1347
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:16,160
with those evil eyes so i'm gonna wrap

1348
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,200
it

1349
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:22,160
oh it's okay it's okay actually monica

1350
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,399
since the the question the not the

1351
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:27,359
question but the speech made by veronica

1352
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:29,359
uh one one question came to my mind uh

1353
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:32,960
which would be mostly related to

1354
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:35,680
uh what is your idea uh about uh

1355
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:36,079
how should should this information be

1356
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,078
doubt

1357
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:41,119
perhaps in legislation or in another

1358
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:44,160
means uh during the electoral context

1359
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:47,119
uh do you think that there will be

1360
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:49,440
a way for us to avoid the measures

1361
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:51,359
established in the bill that do not

1362
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:53,040
allow for repression of specific

1363
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:56,000
political opinions

1364
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:57,920
uh how do you think uh we should deal

1365
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,319
with this electoral context because

1366
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,680
at least in brazil uh perhaps in in

1367
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:04,079
december we're gonna have

1368
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:05,598
uh municipal elections do you have any

1369
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,760
thoughts of sharing it

1370
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:08,960
yeah well thank you for that that

1371
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:11,359
amazing question

1372
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,319
um really really important um so for

1373
00:52:11,359 --> 00:52:15,359
those of you who

1374
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:17,119
are listening and don't know we

1375
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,880
will have elections in brazil they're

1376
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,599
going to be huge even though they're not

1377
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,559
presidential elections they're municipal

1378
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:25,359
we're a huge country so um we're likely

1379
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:28,319
to have

1380
00:52:25,359 --> 00:52:29,200
over 500 000 that's half a million

1381
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,359
candidates

1382
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:33,520
running for presidency so and and spread

1383
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,720
it across across the country so that's

1384
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:37,680
that's huge

1385
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:38,319
um so just making a link to my private

1386
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:41,680
um

1387
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:45,200
um comment when i was talking before

1388
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:48,558
um you know regarding uh political

1389
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,598
uh speech um i think we're we're really

1390
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:52,079
prepared we

1391
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,720
we have the tools in place to give more

1392
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:57,920
transparency to make sure that

1393
00:52:54,720 --> 00:53:00,480
our users know when political

1394
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,880
a political ad is reaching them and not

1395
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:03,359
only that but they know who's paying for

1396
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,640
it

1397
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:08,720
um and so we're we're extremely um

1398
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,000
proud and and happy with the tools we

1399
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:13,439
have in place

1400
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
but i think the one thing that as a

1401
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:16,800
society we should be concerned about is

1402
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,200
um

1403
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,559
really free speech especially as it

1404
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:23,680
stems from

1405
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,200
um intermediary liability rule that's

1406
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:30,480
set forth in marco civil the internet

1407
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:32,319
the one thing we do not wish to

1408
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:33,680
you know to be in the position to do and

1409
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:35,200
we have seen cert

1410
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,440
you know some people advance that

1411
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,520
proposal is we don't want to be put in a

1412
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,319
position to decide

1413
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,240
what is offensive and what isn't to a

1414
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,640
certain candidate right

1415
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:48,000
of course we have our our policies our

1416
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,400
global policies but

1417
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,760
what goes beyond that it's up to the

1418
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:55,599
local courts

1419
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:57,119
to decide if my post criticizing

1420
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:59,599
candidate x

1421
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,319
should you know be removed or should

1422
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,280
stay up

1423
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:03,920
because you know he felt insulted by it

1424
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,640
if if i

1425
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:08,400
cross some line that that relates to the

1426
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,040
local brazilian law

1427
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:13,680
then we do believe that it should be uh

1428
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,720
a local judge to look at that case and

1429
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:17,680
then decide it

1430
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,598
and to that end uh during election times

1431
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,118
and our election period is really really

1432
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:22,640
small in brazil compared to other

1433
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:25,520
countries

1434
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:27,200
we have a huge team in place to be able

1435
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:29,520
to comply with uh

1436
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:31,439
court orders really really really fast

1437
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:34,720
so just so you have an idea

1438
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:35,920
um in the 2018 presidential elections we

1439
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:39,279
were able to comply

1440
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:42,240
with several court orders in a matter of

1441
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:44,240
hours sometimes even minutes um and and

1442
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,799
that's really really important for free

1443
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,240
speech

1444
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:51,200
and um i i'd hate for us to um

1445
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:52,240
in a rush to approve a lot that that

1446
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,359
that we risk

1447
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:57,680
important um important principles that

1448
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,720
are set forth in marco civilian canada

1449
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,118
such as

1450
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:01,759
you know the safe harbor provision set

1451
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,599
forth

1452
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:08,480
by article 19. um at the end of the day

1453
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,799
if if companies are put in a position to

1454
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,079
have

1455
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:15,280
a strong and large legal

1456
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:18,319
you know um liability

1457
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:21,920
um the tendency is to remove

1458
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:24,960
more and and and not to let people

1459
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:28,319
uh talk more freely so i think um

1460
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:30,720
i'd love to see us have an important

1461
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,480
uh political debate when elections come

1462
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,959
and i feel it's important that we keep

1463
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,960
some safeguards when it comes to issues

1464
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:39,119
such as this one

1465
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,119
oh thank you so much monica well we have

1466
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:43,520
now three minutes left

1467
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:44,160
i would like to know if veronica could

1468
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:48,400
answer

1469
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:52,000
a question that i have here in a tweet

1470
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,359
but well axe has now recently

1471
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:58,240
shared a report in which it analyzes uh

1472
00:55:55,359 --> 00:56:00,000
content governance and share some

1473
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,558
recommendations on the theme

1474
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,040
uh one specific point that you address

1475
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,319
on the

1476
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:09,279
on the on this report is how content

1477
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:09,279
governance uh

1478
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,280
affects the rights of specific minority

1479
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
groups

1480
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,400
could you share that in like one tweet

1481
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,480
uh how do you

1482
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:21,280
establish a bridge between that and the

1483
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:21,280
brazilian bill

1484
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:30,879
yeah sure um moderating content is quite

1485
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:34,559
i think okay no but i think it's

1486
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,920
um it's qui your question is

1487
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,640
it's very important because that's

1488
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,799
something i i didn't mention before but

1489
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:42,400
uh all these one of the things that are

1490
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,359
important in the

1491
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:46,160
in the bill uh regarding obviously um

1492
00:56:45,359 --> 00:56:48,558
rating

1493
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:50,399
content and also understanding who is on

1494
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:51,760
internet basically uh tackle the

1495
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,920
anonymity issue

1496
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:55,520
and this anonymity issue is quite

1497
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:59,839
important because we have the right to

1498
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:59,839
be anonymous we have the right to

1499
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:04,240
exercise or rising an anonymous way and

1500
00:57:03,359 --> 00:57:07,759
for some

1501
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:10,240
specific groups this is most important

1502
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,799
more important uh basically because

1503
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:14,799
they've been um

1504
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,240
they've been challenged because uh

1505
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:18,799
sometimes you know

1506
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:19,759
regimes or governments aren't are not so

1507
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:22,160
open to hear

1508
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:24,319
everyone and or maybe they feel

1509
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,759
marginalized or there

1510
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,000
there is some discrimination and

1511
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:31,599
structural discrimination as well so

1512
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:33,440
speech is the way of how they can

1513
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:36,079
exercise i can how they can

1514
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,839
show themselves and that's why content

1515
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:39,520
moderation in this specific case is

1516
00:57:37,839 --> 00:57:41,440
quite important

1517
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,520
because it's it's not just freedom of

1518
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:45,599
expression specifically in the bill but

1519
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:48,880
we have also privacy issues

1520
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:51,520
um that are um very connected to that

1521
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:52,400
so for us it's very important to

1522
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,440
understand

1523
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:58,720
uh that this bill will will

1524
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:01,040
uh will be for everyone that means

1525
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:02,480
with uh this will impact also

1526
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:04,079
communities in brazil

1527
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:06,240
and we know that there are communities

1528
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,799
that might not be

1529
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,680
