great um thank you so much and as you

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:38,959
can see this press conference is not

84
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
going to be disappointing at all we have

85
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
stellar folks

86
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:44,080
here so i'm hoping you'll stay with us

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,080
until the end of our session

88
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
um so before we get into the questions i

89
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,200
want to set the scene a bit

90
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,679
um so so far in 2020 we we as a

91
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,599
accessnow and the kipron coalition have

92
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,959
documented more than 53 internet

93
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,238
shutdown incidents

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:01,920
in at least 15 countries

95
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,760
you might say you know this is not a bad

96
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,640
number compared to what we had last year

97
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,319
around this time

98
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
uh but that's not the case you know

99
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,439
we're hoping especially because now we

100
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,079
are

101
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,640
living under you know a pandemic around

102
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
the world

103
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,399
we thought that you know government

104
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,680
would halt their practice of denying

105
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:18,320
millions of citizens the right to

106
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,160
practice

107
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,680
numerous fundamental freedoms enabled by

108
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,800
the internet but unfortunately that's

109
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,919
not the case

110
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,919
in 2019 um accessnow and

111
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,159
again the kipron coalition documented at

112
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,880
least 213 international towns around the

113
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:34,800
world

114
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,600
and specifically in 33 countries in 2018

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:39,680
uh again we documented over 196

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,160
shutdowns in 25 countries

117
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,280
so what that really tells you is that um

118
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,680
internal shutdowns

119
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,960
are becoming a recurrent issue and it

120
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,479
doesn't seem like they're going away

121
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,239
anytime soon

122
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,680
as i'm speaking to you today for

123
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:53,520
instance uh we've learned that the

124
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,479
government in zimbabwe is trying to shut

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,120
down the internet

126
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,639
during an impeding uh pending protest

127
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,840
that is most likely going to happen

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,360
tomorrow

129
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,880
um this is not the first time zimbabwe

130
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
has shut down the internet and if they

131
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,320
do go here tomorrow

132
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,080
that's going to be a disaster because

133
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:10,000
there's um

134
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,599
government has already arrested a few

135
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,400
journalists and activists and the

136
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,919
situation

137
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,919
um we're worried is going to be the same

138
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,120
one as um as

139
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:22,240
zimbabwe was in 2019 january

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:25,039
uh but you know um all is not

141
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,280
gloom and all is not bad at least we've

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,159
have intervened and you know these these

143
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,919
colleagues of mine

144
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,440
on the call have intervened in at least

145
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,599
two international downs that have

146
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
happened in 2091 and 2019

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,240
uh and another one in in 2017 in tokyo

148
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:40,320
and indonesia respectively

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,759
and they have one um so at least you

150
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,000
know that's good news that we have in

151
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:46,080
2020 one of the very few good news

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,160
um so with that being said i wanna i

153
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,758
wanna ask my colleagues uh a few

154
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:53,759

00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:29,440
i am happy also to join

172
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,840
this press conference it's an honor to

173
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,840
share

174
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
the experience and learn more with other

175
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:40,000
colleagues

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:43,280
in togo in 2017 we have a huge

177
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,560
public demonstration in the country

178
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,758
several are very peaceful

179
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:53,759
but we have received a

180
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,080
real attacks from governments

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,599
as you know tugo is a very small country

182
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,639
in west africa

183
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:02,080
where you have a particular regime a

184
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,120
political context

185
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,120
which is in relation with

186
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,160
the power and the authorities in the

187
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
country

188
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,479
and i think the internet shutdown

189
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,680
arrived like

190
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,479
as a surprise for many people we know

191
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,680
that we haven't

192
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:23,199
a good debate of internet in the country

193
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,720
but it became like something very

194
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:30,400
strong from the authorities after using

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:33,280
police force and other tools

196
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,400
to stop the demonstration in the country

197
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,198
they

198
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,318
take the internet shot down as another

199
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,080
methods

200
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:45,840
to stop how people can

201
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:47,758
join themselves and claim something

202
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,599
people are asking when the

203
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,919
administration

204
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,120
constitutional review because we have a

205
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,318
regime where

206
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,080
you can you can go you can run as you

207
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,479
want when you want to become as a

208
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,359
president and people want the change

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,800
and they started a demonstration with

210
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,759
political parties

211
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,960
particular opposition parties but after

212
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,960
civil society

213
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:16,318
also joined the demonstration and we see

214
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,799
a big trend of a contestation

215
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,879
of authorities in the country and we

216
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:24,319
have received this shutdown

217
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,479
after several days but the problem was

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,840
how to

219
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:31,840
make the proof that it is a a

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,838
internet shutdown because it is start

221
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,640
very slowly and after you have

222
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
any nothing when when you run through

223
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,838
the country

224
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,440
it is to all the country it's not

225
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:44,480
something in the capital or

226
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,440
in the big areas but it is in the all

227
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,839
the country

228
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,560
it is in this context we have seen the

229
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:52,160
internet

230
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:55,199
shut down first of all it was for us

231
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,120
i i combined this two questions already

232
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,600
it was uh something very particular

233
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,200
and uh emotional also because we have

234
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,240
received many debates

235
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,959
coming from civil society ngo in the

236
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,920
country

237
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,279
and also international ngo who are here

238
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,479
in the country

239
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,600
and we decide to look careful

240
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,080
and see how it can be useful for us

241
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,959
as a case and i think we have worked

242
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
closely with

243
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,560
our regional office in dhaka where the

244
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:28,080
idea

245
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,518
arrived that how can us use this like

246
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,040
a strategic litigation a case and see

247
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:35,920
how it can help

248
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,199
other countries in the region west

249
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,240
africa

250
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:43,360
and then it become for us clear that

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:46,080
eco has got can be a way

252
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,040
for us to have this kind of decision or

253
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:50,399
judgment

254
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:53,279
which can be like a lesson for other

255
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,720
countries in the in the region i think

256
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,600
if it is in togo

257
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,200
we can we are we can i can tell you that

258
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,839
we can have a chance

259
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,560
to have a good segment no because we

260
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,240
know

261
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,640
our system here how it works very slowly

262
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,519
and

263
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,480
no will also for for from the

264
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,680
authorities

265
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,560
to do something around this kind of

266
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,519
situation and it can't be their purity

267
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,640
at this moment

268
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:21,040
then we have decided to go to equal

269
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,720
score

270
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,160
because also in the past we have

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,440
received another

272
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:30,719
good decision not on internet but

273
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,880
like on torture for example

274
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,079
then we have decided to go there where

275
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,040
we can have

276
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,000
this kind of judgment it's what i can

277
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:41,360
put on the table

278
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:43,279
yeah great thank you so much

279
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
and you know and i this makes me wish

280
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:45,839
you know we as

281
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,440
in in east africa i had a you know

282
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,040
stronger court like you

283
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,399
um because the equals courts are indeed

284
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,760
setting such an interesting and

285
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
important precedent

286
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,839
yeah um so moving from togo swifty to

287
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,160
indonesia

288
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,600
had a same question for you you know why

289
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,880
did the indonesian government shut down

290
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:05,040
the internet and papa

291
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,040
and why did you take them to court

292
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:15,920
okay thank you again yeah

293
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:19,040
uh as uh the public now is

294
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,319
papua is the area is

295
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,040
still uh many conflict and at the time

296
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,320
in

297
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,519
last year 2019

298
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:32,320
in august there is a massive conflict in

299
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:32,320
the papua

300
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:39,920
then the government is like they use

301
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,720
sarcasm because they see the many of the

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,000
hogs

303
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,959
spreading in the papua and they

304
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,959
cut the internet

305
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,959
the internet saturn is first time for

306
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,399
indonesia

307
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,560
but the throttling or slowdown is

308
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,560
already three times and

309
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:04,000
internet certainly in the region was

310
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,240
done because it was surprised the

311
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,079
dissemination of the hawks information

312
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,200
that was considered to provoke the

313
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,319
community

314
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:14,880
but in other hand when the internet

315
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,440
disconnect there were sectors that were

316
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,959
affected

317
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:22,720
such education e-government

318
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:22,719
and journalism also

319
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:27,760
so that we represent a civil society

320
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:30,720
filling citizen lawsuit with the

321
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,959
organizational legal standing mechanisms

322
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,959
uh

323
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,920
the before we filling the lawsuit

324
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,399
we usually we make like a theory of case

325
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:43,920
uh

326
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:46,800
which case we will

327
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
fill in the to the chords and we choose

328
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,359
the

329
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,240
press freedom is more natural

330
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,360
we can choose the e-government we can

331
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,360
just a freedom of

332
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:02,560
expression or a business sector but

333
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,959
uh in this time price freedom in

334
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,479
indonesia is more natural and

335
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:11,760
more strong legal basis

336
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:14,320
to bring to the guard why and

337
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:16,399
many argument in our lawsuit is all

338
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:20,399
about the human rights and

339
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:23,290
about the how press freedom uh

340
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:25,120
using in the conflict area and

341
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,360
[Music]

342
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,600
and the main argument is the laws of the

343
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:31,760
internet to

344
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,360
hire to work journalists to provide

345
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:36,800
information to the public

346
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:39,040
like that and the key argument of the

347
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:42,079
lawsuit is

348
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:43,120
some obstacles felt by journalists and

349
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,199
the media such

350
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,320
inability to disseminate information in

351
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,560
online media

352
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,920
difficulty communicating with the

353
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:53,359
resource persons

354
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,399
difficulty of the fact checking the

355
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,360
television yeah they can

356
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,399
live broadcast and there is no print

357
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,120
media

358
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:05,279
also all activities in journalistic were

359
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:10,240
affected to the

360
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:13,360
because the internet's not done and also

361
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:16,480
the the important thing is

362
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:20,000
is like collaboration

363
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:23,279
in this lawsuit we not only

364
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,519
lbaps is not only uh plaintiff but we

365
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,760
are a legals we are lawyers

366
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,680
we have collaboration with other

367
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,880
organizations

368
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,160
separate three teams it's like the first

369
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,399
is principal teams

370
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,439
principal team is as the plaintiff of

371
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,959
the organization

372
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:44,320
is like the journalist alliance

373
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:46,800
and the second team is litigation team

374
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,040
litigation teams are a lawyer who makes

375
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:52,240
and prepare legal argument in the courts

376
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,399
is like our organizations and the third

377
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,480
is about the campaign team this

378
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,000
collaboration team is very important in

379
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,120
the

380
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:04,800
strategic litigations

381
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,320
also the the most challenge is

382
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:12,240
so many attack coming to us

383
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,600
because they are the buzzer

384
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,000
is like the present uh

385
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,800
we are supporting of papua independence

386
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:21,120
is yeah

387
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:22,479
like because it's very sensitive issue

388
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,959
yeah about the

389
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,560
independence in some area in the

390
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,479
province like that

391
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:34,160
and they using this issue to

392
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,160
yeah to decrease our

393
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:43,439
our uh to the public something like that

394
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,120
yeah okay um

395
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,560
thank you so much adi and that's the you

396
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:47,519
know you raise a really important point

397
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,638
here is that you know

398
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,639
it's it's not always you know

399
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:54,160
rosy and nice and green to see your

400
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:54,959
governments it also comes with a lot of

401
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
challenges

402
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:58,638
and you also raise an important point

403
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:01,920
here that you know it's not just about

404
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:03,279
um you know filing a a petition at the

405
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,120
court but it's also about advocacy and

406
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:06,639
you know raising public awareness so

407
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,720
you raise some really interesting points

408
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,839
and we'll come back to that uh

409
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:16,399
later on um so i want to move on to

410
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:18,480
uh to saba um from uh from media defense

411
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,000
um so your organization litigates on

412
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:22,160
public interest issues specifically

413
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,360
related to freedom of expression and

414
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,800
press freedom and other issues and

415
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,839
you've said some really interesting

416
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,479
precedence

417
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,360
previously within the equals courts but

418
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,279
then now

419
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:32,480
uh so my question for you here today is

420
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,279
you know is this your first

421
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,120
litigation on shutdowns and why now and

422
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,399
why they shut down specifically in togo

423
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:45,519
thanks um yeah um so i guess it's

424
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:49,120
probably just building on what um

425
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:51,839
amy was saying about togo and

426
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,920
what the reason was why we as lawyers

427
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:55,759
decided that this was going to be a good

428
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,680
opportunity for us to get involved in

429
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:59,759
the litigation so

430
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,719
obviously um the shutdown happened in

431
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:03,199
2017

432
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,079
so whilst we are seeing a trend at the

433
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:06,240
moment with with

434
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,119
shutdowns this this happened a good few

435
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,799
years ago and

436
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:10,319
at that point there wasn't much

437
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,720
litigation that was going

438
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,918
on through either domestic or kind of

439
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,520
international

440
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,199
mechanisms that were looking at these

441
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,359
issues so when this came

442
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:21,120
about it was a good opportunity to get

443
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:23,359
involved in litigation

444
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:25,359
the other kind of consideration for us

445
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,039
was the fact that the equest

446
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,799
court was an available regional

447
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,120
mechanism and

448
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,000
actually the court doesn't require you

449
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,080
to access that

450
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,080
court you don't actually need to have

451
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,760
exhausted domestic remedies

452
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,918
so that was something that we had um

453
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,000
found difficult for example in other

454
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:45,679
jurisdictions whereby

455
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,000
litigation through the domestic courts

456
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,080
had been stored but we had no access to

457
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,080
a regional mechanism to to kind of take

458
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:54,480
the case too but the equus court doesn't

459
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:56,240
actually have that requirement so

460
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,919
again that was something to you know

461
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
when you're considering litigation

462
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:01,200
you're kind of

463
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,240
it's an accessible court um that you can

464
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,360
go to

465
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:07,520
um and then similarly to what um amy was

466
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,399
saying in terms of setting a precedent

467
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:12,240
um for the region was something that was

468
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,440
going to be considered and

469
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:17,600
in um you know a positive judgment

470
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,799
which we think we've got now from from

471
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,678
the echoes court is

472
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:23,520
inevitably gonna set a precedent um for

473
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,039
the region and and you can use that more

474
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,400
globally as well

475
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:29,120
um i guess just one other thing also

476
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,400
when

477
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,239
as lawyers when you're looking to

478
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:35,200
litigate cases is

479
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,240
identifying appropriate petitioners or

480
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,520
applicants

481
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,440
and often you know

482
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:43,520
with internet shutdowns i guess one of

483
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
the considerations is that these are

484
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,879
coming

485
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:51,440
are being held in in jurisdictions where

486
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,960
um there's often you know quite an

487
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:56,000
authoritarian state

488
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,760
and you need to weigh up whether you're

489
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,760
going to get applicants and petitioners

490
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
coming forward and what the risk

491
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:04,400
value is of those kind of applicants and

492
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,280
coming forward to litigate these cases

493
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,880
so for us i mean media defense is quite

494
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,520
a small organization we're based in

495
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,600
london

496
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,600
and we were able to work with amnesty

497
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,480
international amazon togo

498
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,439
um who have far you know better

499
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
resources than

500
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:22,799
us in in kind of collating evidence

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,799
whether that's witness statements etc

502
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,320
and we had applicants that were willing

503
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,520
to kind of go forward

504
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:32,639
um to kind of bring the claim so

505
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:34,960
for us um togo was all of these kind of

506
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,240
things were plus points and and going to

507
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,480
the equos court

508
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,640
um i mean it took some time the case the

509
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:42,799
shutdown happened in 2017 and i think we

510
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:46,000
filed at the end of 2018

511
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,918
after we had kind of um collated

512
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,520
the necessary evidence and managed to

513
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
get what we needed

514
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:53,440
to put in a strong application and then

515
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:56,400
obviously the judgment has come out

516
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,360
um a few weeks ago so these things

517
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,400
always take time

518
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
and um it's useful to have like

519
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,520
to partner up with organizations that

520
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,880
may have better reach

521
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:09,918
contacts domestically in the region

522
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:13,360
and to be able to put forward a strong a

523
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,360
strong application to the court

524
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:19,600
um thank you saba for that um and i

525
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,600
will definitely come back to some of the

526
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,678
work that media defense is particularly

527
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,439
doing on shutdowns later on

528
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:29,520
so natalia um i'm coming to you here i i

529
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,720
know access now has intervened

530
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:35,840
in both in the togo and indonesia case

531
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,960
and i want you to tell us how i uh tell

532
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,840
the public

533
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:41,200
how we intervene intervened and

534
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:42,320
specifically on on what that

535
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,400
intervention was

536
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:46,320
and i know specifically intervening in

537
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,159
the togo case was not easy there was you

538
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
know the government have challenged

539
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,760
our standing with the court then you

540
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,799
know had challenged um the amicus brief

541
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,480
that we had submitted

542
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,240
um so i i think that's also an

543
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,360
interesting story to tell in terms of

544
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,280
being prepared

545
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,959
um so tell us you know what happened

546
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,760
what transpired and why we intervened in

547
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,159
these kids as well

548
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,280
thank you berhan yes so as you mentioned

549
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:10,080
in both cases

550
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:13,440
in the ecowas court in togo and

551
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,960
indonesia jakarta court we intervened

552
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:20,400
as friends of the court or amiki curay

553
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,440
uh with a brief advising the court uh on

554
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
international legal

555
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,120
standards that and norms are applied

556
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,120
that are applicable to

557
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:31,280
internet shutdowns in particular we also

558
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:33,760
shared our expertise of the kipiran

559
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:37,280
coalition explaining the court what are

560
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:41,440
shutdowns why they're important

561
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:43,678
and encourage the court to look not only

562
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,360
at internet shutdowns in the context of

563
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,720
the right of freedom of expression which

564
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,120
is of course important

565
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:50,240
but it's sort of the most widely applied

566
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,360
uh

567
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,559
um right to this uh event but there's

568
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:56,479
also other rights that

569
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:58,320
might be violated such as the rights of

570
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,240
freedom of assembly

571
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,158
right to work health education and

572
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,120
cultural rights

573
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,520
so we did that in the indonesia case we

574
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,879
did our own brief and then in the ecowas

575
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,799
case we joined with

576
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,039
eight uh it was a coalition of eight

577
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,320
organizations that we led

578
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:18,400
and uh amica's briefs are uh have

579
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:20,158
become a standard practice in many

580
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,480
courts around the world

581
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:23,760
uh including the jakarta accord and the

582
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,440
ecowas court

583
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,200
so we have seen such interventions in

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,360
the past and they haven't really been

585
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:31,840
challenged before

586
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,760
but in the togo case the togolese

587
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:37,039
government decided to challenge

588
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:40,000
our submission and they made

589
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,480
a number of arguments which frankly kind

590
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,559
of just

591
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,520
showed that they didn't have proper

592
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,480
understanding

593
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,559
of the role of amiki and also of the

594
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,799
rules of the court

595
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,240
so they made this argument that we

596
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:55,280
cannot

597
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,960
make a submission because we are experts

598
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,799
and so there are different rules that

599
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:02,080
apply to experts

600
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:03,679
um there also uh cited other rules uh

601
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,879
article 43 of the

602
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,679
of the echoes rules and the qos protocol

603
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,919
various um you know cited various

604
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:13,679
um rules to say that basically our

605
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:15,760
submission was improper

606
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,679
and that we were not specifically

607
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,440
ordered by the court or by one of the

608
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:22,000
parties

609
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,960
but we did i mean it was a bit

610
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:25,200
unexpected

611
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,400
to be honest but at the same time we

612
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,440
were uh quick

613
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,919
in coming up with a lot of case law on

614
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:32,159
this

615
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,840
from echoes but also other courts in

616
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:35,919
west africa

617
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:38,559
um and there are also rules and

618
00:23:35,919 --> 00:23:40,799
protocols of the court itself that

619
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:42,399
point us to actually the the right

620
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,480
decision in this case

621
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,960
and so we cited all of that and the

622
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:50,080
court actually ruled in our favor

623
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:53,279
uh saying that they distinguish between

624
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:55,279
third-party interventions uh which are

625
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:58,080
for parties that are sort of directly

626
00:23:55,279 --> 00:24:01,600
affected by the outcome of the case

627
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:03,520
and amiki who are just there to be

628
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:06,879
friends of the court and advise the

629
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,960
court on the international standards

630
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,520
and so the court has that power and

631
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,799
discretion to allow for

632
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:16,799
amid to intervene and so this was a very

633
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:18,960
good decision and we hope that

634
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:22,158
it would become precedent also for other

635
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:25,360
cases where ngos and other actors

636
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:28,320
are trying to intervene on

637
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,158
shut down cases and beyond because we

638
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,120
think it's important to share our

639
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,520
expertise

640
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,239
with the court and make sure that the

641
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,400
court has

642
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,600
a full understanding on not only the

643
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:41,200
significance of

644
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,039
shutdowns for human rights but also that

645
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
the courts would apply international

646
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,879
human rights standards to such cases to

647
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
the fullest extent

648
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,039
so we were happy that the the court uh

649
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:53,039
the court decision in this case

650
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,360
um thank you so much natalia for that

651
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,479
and i think um that that specific

652
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,918
precedence that you know

653
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,200
not just on the shutdown but on being

654
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,960
able to be friends at the court is

655
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,720
really important and you know gives

656
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
and not just international organizations

657
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,640
like us and i think that amicus was not

658
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,720
just us it was you know coalition of

659
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,880
other grassroots civil society groups uh

660
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,799
from africa and other places as well so

661
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,080
that gives us a lot of energy to

662
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:19,120
continue um

663
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,799
so i'm coming to you peter uh access now

664
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,039
has been documenting internal shutdowns

665
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,799
as early as 2011 i think the first few

666
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,039
cases that i can even remember

667
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,200
that you have talked about is the the

668
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:31,440
wi-fi outage in san francisco uh

669
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,799
transportation system um you know so

670
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,559
much has changed since

671
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,158
uh since then and you know we're

672
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,200
documenting way more shutdowns than

673
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,120
before

674
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,799
um so what do you think is the role of

675
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:43,039
the newly formed legal arm

676
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:44,960
within access now and how will that be

677
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:46,158
defining how old shutdowns and our work

678
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,679
will be defining the

679
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:49,520
litigation against shutdowns but then

680
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,640
also some of the work that access now

681
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,639
wants to do on this topic

682
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,440
thank you that shut down in san

683
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:00,399
francisco in 2011

684
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:00,960
was shocking um up until that point the

685
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,360
only

686
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,080
shutdowns we'd seen were uh maybe in

687
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:06,719
egypt or

688
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:08,320
myanmar shutdowns were seen as the tool

689
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,679
of dictators

690
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
not something that any you know

691
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:14,559
supposedly democratic

692
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,520
government would allow or uh that

693
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,918
officials certainly

694
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,279
in in the heart of silicon valley would

695
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,880
uh put in place

696
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,200
um the uh the responses to that

697
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,720
that san francisco shut down as well as

698
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,600
to the egypt shutdown

699
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,679
um did find their way into into court

700
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,439
and regulatory bodies

701
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,919
um in egypt there are worlds reporting

702
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,679
that um after the mubarak regime

703
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:43,919
famously shut down the internet

704
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,880
uh the height of protests in early 2011.

705
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
the telcos took the regime to court and

706
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:51,039
actually won

707
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,000
a large award for their lost profits

708
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:56,000
there was no uh follow-up on that and it

709
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,799
doesn't seem like the telcos shared that

710
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,200
award with

711
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,240
you know the people uh who actually had

712
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,760
their rights

713
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:06,640
directly violated and um and lost access

714
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:08,879
at that crucial moment and i'm happy to

715
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:12,000
say that you know the public interest

716
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:14,400
has been and continues to be represented

717
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,039
in all of these cases that we've heard

718
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,000
um we were happy to get involved with

719
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:21,039
media

720
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,240
defense in the cameroon cases working

721
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:25,039
closely with

722
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,640
um lawyers on the ground there and and

723
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,679
as we've heard in the following

724
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,840
uh cases in ecowas and

725
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,039
i think uh these cases are growing in

726
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,080
prominence

727
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:38,799
and uh the the coalition is

728
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:40,720
maturing in our strategy we heard just

729
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,279
earlier this morning at writescon

730
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,320
that litigation cannot occur in a vacuum

731
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:47,440
it can't occur in

732
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:50,559
isolation that it really needs to be one

733
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:52,399
sharp tool uh among many

734
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:54,000
and uh you know it's the tip of the

735
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,918
spear and the spear you know it's really

736
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:58,240
in the hands of the coalition it's a

737
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,120
in the hands of the movement uh who are

738
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:02,159
making the

739
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,520
uh making the case that shutdowns not

740
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:07,600
only violate

741
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:09,520
human rights like that to assembly and

742
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:12,080
access to information expression but

743
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:14,000
actually damaged entire societies in

744
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:16,399
terms of their

745
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,880
economies their digital economies and

746
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,000
their access to health and education

747
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,279
information online and uh that's what

748
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:26,640
this broad-based movement

749
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:30,159
that keep it on is uh has become

750
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,640
the legal arm we want to leverage this

751
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,799
this great broad robust coalition all

752
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,919
the evidence that this coalition is able

753
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,399
to collect

754
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,840
um on these different impacts uh you

755
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:42,559
know the human the economic

756
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:43,360
the social leverage those impacts and

757
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:46,559
tell the story

758
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,719
in court in a way that you know these is

759
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,320
fairly usually senior judges

760
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,559
who don't have a lot of experience with

761
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,559
the internet can understand

762
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:55,600
and and can understand a way that they

763
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,600
can adjudicate

764
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,360
right that they can see that not only

765
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,520
these are rights and interests that are

766
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:03,279
being uh directly harmed by the

767
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,960
the government's action but there's

768
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,919
there's a role for the courts to play

769
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,320
and um our legal arm which i'm happy to

770
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,240
say

771
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:17,039
has grown and has matured uh to include

772
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,440
natalya and others is is looking to

773
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:22,240
play sort of a central nervous system

774
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,399
role we want to coordinate we want to

775
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,279
strengthen you know send resources out

776
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,439
to

777
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:28,399
those really intrepid often solo

778
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:32,159
practitioners

779
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:34,000
those small legal offices or ngos

780
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,760
like we've seen in indonesia and

781
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,919
cameroon and elsewhere who do face

782
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,640
reprisal for bringing these cases

783
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,200
we want to reinforce them um with the

784
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,520
the

785
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,919
legitimacy with the expertise with the

786
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,080
gravitas of an international coalition

787
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:49,200
um where that's where that's going to be

788
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,760
helpful and

789
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:53,440
uh call for and request it and so um so

790
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,559
that's that role we want to play

791
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,640
is helping to you know spread

792
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,678
communication to ensure that

793
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,559
we build on the precedents um that we've

794
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,799
seen

795
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:06,000
in these really great victories recently

796
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,918
in indonesia and

797
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,200
ikwas so we yeah well we want to keep

798
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:13,760
this vantage point and then

799
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,919
keep uh punching upwards and looking

800
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:18,559
towards those international institutions

801
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:20,000
um towards those international courts

802
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,440
and regional courts

803
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,559
that uh you know will we help eventually

804
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,520
um speak directly to this and uh

805
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:31,200
build on again and draw from these uh

806
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,679
individual cases that are so

807
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,320
important in ending shutdowns at the

808
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:38,000
national

809
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,840
and local levels great um

810
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,000
thank you so much peter and i think

811
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,639
there is one really important thing here

812
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,760
you know um the solo lawyers that are

813
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,000
frustrated with

814
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,120
with you know having to experience shut

815
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:50,880
down every other week

816
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,678
not really understanding how they can

817
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,200
you know engage is is very important

818
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:56,880
for you know for access now and for the

819
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:58,480
legal team and media defense and others

820
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,360
to be able to channel that resources and

821
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:01,360
that

822
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,199
whether it's the briefs or the petitions

823
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,360
you know um that's that's i think it's a

824
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,480
really um is a really good and important

825
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,760
place to start another i think the

826
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,120
second thing that you mentioned as well

827
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,720
yes the senior

828
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,719
judge don't necessarily understand how

829
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:14,399
the internet works you know how

830
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,320
much of these course that we engage with

831
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,639
are rarely online right um

832
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,720
so it's so it's important that you know

833
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,360
we meet them where they are as well

834
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,919
so those two are are important things um

835
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,600
um

836
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:27,679
so i want to encourage the audience to

837
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,120
ask questions we have a few questions uh

838
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,440
in the chat but as you you know

839
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,959
as the conversation goes on please do

840
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,960
add your questions

841
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:36,480
so we have a comment uh from the chat

842
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,720
that says you know no requirement for

843
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:40,559
exhaustion of local remedies uh unique

844
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,360
features at the equest court indeed

845
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:44,000
um asaba said those are very very unique

846
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,360
um

847
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,120
features of the aircraft court and i

848
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,559
wish i know

849
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,559
many of my brothers and sisters across

850
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:53,519
the continent wish that they had

851
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:54,559
disorder coits um and we we have a kids

852
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,240
in uganda that's

853
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:57,918
still stuck but it has to for instance

854
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:59,440
we have to exhaust that

855
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
that local mechanism before we move to

856
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:03,039
the east african courts uh

857
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:04,479
and and other similar situations as well

858
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:05,279
uh so if that was the case we would have

859
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:07,519
moved

860
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:08,640
um to the east african courts um in

861
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:10,399
arusha um

862
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,240
so there's a question here for uh for

863
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,120
amy from from togo

864
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,919
uh but i know this is an open and i want

865
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,120
to open this up

866
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:19,519
to the other participants as well

867
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,000
because it affects others as well so

868
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:23,600
uh jean-paul our friend john paul asks

869
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,440
um you know have you faced any threats

870
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,840
during the litigation process so

871
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:29,600
amy for you and then after he's done a

872
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:32,720
day you can continue

873
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:33,678
okay thank you very much uh before we

874
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:36,320
jump to the

875
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,399
question uh can i add something about

876
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,360
ikoa's particularity

877
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,518
i think we are afraid we are afraid that

878
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,799
uh in the next future

879
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:48,080
i think some countries will go to amend

880
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:51,519
the protocol

881
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,120
to see if they can go in in a system

882
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,919
where you need to

883
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:57,039
finish with local system before joining

884
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:59,279
the equal score

885
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:00,320
we are afraid but at this moment we are

886
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,840
happy that

887
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:06,080
we can go without any system at local

888
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:08,799
level then

889
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:10,559
it is what we have like as a challenge

890
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:13,679
for the future we can use

891
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:16,080
our network for advocacy when we t we

892
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:17,519
will have these issues i hope and trust

893
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,879
that you will join us

894
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,799
if there is a campaign on on that uh

895
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,279
for fall from john paul i think i can

896
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:28,320
tell you honestly we haven't received

897
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,440
any

898
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:32,639
physical trait or a particular treat

899
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:36,320
during this

900
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,519
process but we have a

901
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:39,840
huge challenge with the administration

902
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:42,159
in

903
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:44,399
in the country because before send the

904
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:48,240
document to the god you need to

905
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:51,039
have the what you call a legalization

906
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,320
legalization you need to have the stamp

907
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:55,519
of the administration

908
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,879
of a notary service that it

909
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,760
is the authentic document

910
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,200
i can tell you that in all the world to

911
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,559
go

912
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:07,600
no notary has accepted to put his

913
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,320
signature

914
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,118
and stamp on our document they have

915
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,800
refused

916
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,639
when they see that there is something

917
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:16,320
against the country or against the

918
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:19,760
authorities they say okay

919
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,800
no no i can do it go here when you go

920
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,879
there

921
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,839
another people will still go in another

922
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:26,000
place then

923
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,040
it was a very difficult moment but we

924
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,159
have to try

925
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,800
with our own relation to find some

926
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,280
people

927
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,720
who have accepted to put their stamp and

928
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,000
signature to send it

929
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:38,799
but now we are afraid for a long time a

930
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,239
long-term

931
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,879
treat particular with our local partners

932
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,799
because

933
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,159
it's not just at least international

934
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:49,359
togo but you have

935
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:49,760
other ngo which they are very local very

936
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:53,440
small

937
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,720
ngo and we have also a journalist

938
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,400
a freelancer she has accepted to join

939
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:03,839
the the case and then i think

940
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,040
we know how the our regime works

941
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:11,520
perhaps they could use other other other

942
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:15,119
ways to to stop funding or something

943
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,920
for this local ngo we are here

944
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:19,920
looking and working closely with them to

945
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:23,280
see how we can

946
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:24,240
together go over this kind of treat we

947
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:27,280
can have

948
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,759
in the future but clearly

949
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,359
yeah human rights work you need to

950
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,839
consider traits when you

951
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:35,359
want to do something against authorities

952
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:38,960
or something like that

953
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,240
that we have um we have planned

954
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:43,280
something

955
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:45,520
for this next year for the next year

956
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:47,520
to see how we can follow the decision

957
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,119
and how we can continue working

958
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,119
together thank you

959
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:55,680
thank you very much amy scoping like a

960
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:56,000
true true warrior there a peaceful one

961
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,040
though

962
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:03,040
um so over to you a day

963
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:05,520
yeah uh in the first time

964
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,320
i believe that the litigation is the

965
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:09,119
safe way

966
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:09,520
because it is uh yeah it's the legal way

967
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,320
to

968
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:14,240
against the government what they are

969
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:17,119
doing

970
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,598
but yeah in the in the in the process so

971
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,720
many

972
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:24,079
challenges uh what

973
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,279
we have is like the first is about the

974
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,240
plaintiff legal standing the

975
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,040
organization who be plaintiff is in

976
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,720
jakarta

977
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,920
but the case in the papua is so many

978
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,049
uh defendant argue that

979
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:41,680
they not be able to do

980
00:36:40,050 --> 00:36:44,160
[Music]

981
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,680
feeling lost because we we are in the

982
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:49,118
jakarta it's like that

983
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,200
and the second is uh about the yeah

984
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,480
we they they call we are supporting the

985
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:57,439
papua independence

986
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:58,800
is is very very sensitive issue that

987
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:02,480
what i said before

988
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,839
uh when when the

989
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,359
people look we are the supporting the

990
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:09,920
public independence yeah the

991
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:10,960
public support will decrease for for us

992
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,960
is very

993
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:18,240
very danger also for the future of the

994
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:21,359
lawsuit because sometimes the judge is

995
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:25,040
looking in the political context

996
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:28,400
and the third is uh the government

997
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,599
in the context of the internet sat down

998
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,320
usually using the stat in the

999
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,200
state of danger is like yeah emergency

1000
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,599
accents

1001
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,399
yeah then we also using this argument in

1002
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:43,839
the court

1003
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:46,960
the if you if the government want to

1004
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:47,440
using the emergency action is like there

1005
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:50,720
is

1006
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,280
specific uh

1007
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,959
to fulfill is like the human rights

1008
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,079
thunder something that and

1009
00:37:54,960 --> 00:38:01,680
and yeah we we want and the

1010
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:05,200
judges agree with us

1011
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:06,480
about the how the government using the

1012
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,319
emergency action

1013
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,280
yeah and in the

1014
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,520
the case it's like the judge ruled that

1015
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:16,720
it was considered an emergency that the

1016
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,119
president should have

1017
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:20,319
used the decision not the press release

1018
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:23,440
from the ministry

1019
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,480
only like that yeah

1020
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,560
okay um thank you so much

1021
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,920
that's that's you two raise a really

1022
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,720
important point here it's not just you

1023
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,400
know

1024
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:34,078
your physical safety it's also you know

1025
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,200
smear campaigns from governments and you

1026
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,200
know trying to

1027
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,520
uh dissuade the public from uh from

1028
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:41,680
supporting your really important work so

1029
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,960
this is definitely an uphill um battle

1030
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:45,598
that changed from one

1031
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,599
country to another um so i i want to go

1032
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,119
back to and again i want to encourage

1033
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:51,280
uh the audience if you if you have any

1034
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,560
questions please pop them in the chat

1035
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:56,000
um so i i want to go back to saba from

1036
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,040
media defense

1037
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,079
um so this was indeed a good win

1038
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:03,920
um for you know for our fight for

1039
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:06,480
against internet shutdowns

1040
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:08,160
so what's next what does this mean uh

1041
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,839
for media defense because you guys

1042
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,680
you know your your sole mandate and your

1043
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:14,160
whole existence is about

1044
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,160
uh you know suing governments which is

1045
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:17,680
it's quite admirable so tell us what's

1046
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,799
next what's coming up next

1047
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:22,640
for you sure um

1048
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,480
yeah so obviously we we welcome the

1049
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
equest decision and the fact that the

1050
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,920
court

1051
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,560
took so much time to decide on these

1052
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:31,040
issues

1053
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,960
and that was in a case that i guess was

1054
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:35,839
quite evidently complex

1055
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:37,119
for us is is useful because you're able

1056
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,240
to use this president

1057
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,920
um for future litigation so

1058
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:44,399
as a group of lawyers for us always next

1059
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,920
is

1060
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,160
what's the next case what's the next

1061
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:51,359
state and that we can kind of

1062
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:53,359
um launch litigation in and

1063
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:54,720
i mean i'm conscious we have cases in

1064
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,520
the pipeline and i can't really

1065
00:39:54,720 --> 00:39:58,000
prejudice

1066
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,040
those cases by naming them but we have

1067
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,640
various kind of

1068
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,640
we see that the issue of internet

1069
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,879
shutdowns is one that's not going away

1070
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:06,799
so we are seeing this um happen in

1071
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,880
various jurisdictions and

1072
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:10,480
ways of now now that we have this

1073
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,640
judgment coming out of like

1074
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,000
a regional mechanism to use that along

1075
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:17,040
with the domestic kind of

1076
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,920
um decisions that have come out of

1077
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:21,040
indonesia

1078
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,119
and kashmir etc um is is all

1079
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,640
all going to form part of like the next

1080
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,880
strategic litigation of

1081
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,640
four internet shutdowns the other thing

1082
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:32,079
i guess just to kind of know

1083
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,480
um about what's next often with cases

1084
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,359
and when judgment comes out there's this

1085
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,280
kind of

1086
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,359
um whilst you get these positive

1087
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,520
decisions and it's great often there's

1088
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:42,799
the kind of afterthought of

1089
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,160
implementation

1090
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,480
and we've heard um a lot of times from

1091
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,279
you know participants um on this call as

1092
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:50,800
well that

1093
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,200
litigation doesn't normally have you

1094
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,960
know it can't happen in a vacuum and

1095
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,680
once you get these decisions what would

1096
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,280
you do

1097
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:59,118
or how would you go about trying to get

1098
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,240
them to be implemented

1099
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:03,520
um and that can be that sometimes that

1100
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:06,479
can be quite difficult

1101
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:08,160
in terms of how you make sure that the

1102
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,359
decisions that the courts have been made

1103
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,440
are actually being

1104
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,960
impacted within the region or the

1105
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,880
country that um that

1106
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,240
you know that the order has been made

1107
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,760
and i guess

1108
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,560
um often advocacy campaigns are some

1109
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:24,640
something that you know does kick in at

1110
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:27,200
this point and to highlight that

1111
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,118
actually the state that's in question

1112
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,359
hasn't done it any of the steps that

1113
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,040
have been that has been needed to be

1114
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:36,160
done within the order

1115
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,960
um so whether that's like repealing um

1116
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:40,078
laws or putting new laws in place

1117
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,920
adhered to national

1118
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,079
or international standards or even

1119
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:46,720
payments um if there are damages

1120
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:47,599
awards or costs that are being ordered

1121
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:50,799
by a court

1122
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:53,359
often you know that takes time um for

1123
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:55,359
applicants to get payments so all of

1124
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:57,520
these things are considerations so

1125
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:59,520
just because judgments come out it's

1126
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,480
often that's not the final step it's

1127
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:02,960
implementation

1128
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:04,000
and as far as media defense is concerned

1129
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,520
yeah we

1130
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,119
we're going to continue litigating and

1131
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:09,440
we've been learning so much through

1132
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:11,520
these litigations that we've been doing

1133
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:13,680
through um you know togo and then i

1134
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,880
think people mentioned cameroon etc so

1135
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:17,359
all of this for us

1136
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,720
are you know as low as learning curves

1137
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:20,480
and we're able to implement that into

1138
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,000
the next kind of case

1139
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:27,040
um that we're going to be litigating

1140
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:29,680
yeah great

1141
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,079
um thank you very much for that sabbah

1142
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:33,200

so i wonder i want to go back to um you

1144
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,399

1145
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,359
forefront fighters those folks that are

1146
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,800
on the ground that are actually

1147
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:39,359
experiencing the shutdown and you know

1148
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:41,520
taking

1149
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:43,040
uh taking government scores so uh back

1150
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,000
to you andy and

1151
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,640
amy um are there any lessons that you've

1152
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:49,040
learned

1153
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:49,920
uh from from this specific litigation

1154
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,359
you know

1155
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,280
for others that are on the call that are

1156
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:56,160
listening and are interested to bring um

1157
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:57,359
cases against uh against their um their

1158
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,000
respective governments you know what

1159
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:59,440
would you advise

1160
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,200
them what would you do differently and

1161
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,119
that's a this is a question that came

1162
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:04,720
from the audience as well so maybe we

1163
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,860
can start with ade and then we can go to

1164
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:08,000
amy

1165
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:11,760
[Music]

1166
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,280
yeah in yeah in our experience

1167
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:18,319
there is no uh what

1168
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,800
uh not to do is like

1169
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,000
we need to consistent with the our

1170
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:25,920
strategy

1171
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:27,280
uh the minimum team is like litigation

1172
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:30,319
and non-litigation

1173
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:30,960
and you can choose where you stay you

1174
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,480
can choose

1175
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,880
litigation and you will focus to yeah

1176
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,960
in the litigation and if you choose

1177
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,160
non-litigation you can choose a campaign

1178
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,400
something like that

1179
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,399
i think the consistence of the uh

1180
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:47,680
where you stay is i think is important

1181
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:50,160
because it's like

1182
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,799
in the collaboration team yeah you

1183
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:54,480
cannot

1184
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:58,880
do this alone or you can

1185
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,599
do lawsuits with together because it's

1186
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,880
you fight against the government you

1187
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:06,560
you're not again the

1188
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,240
individual or the business like but you

1189
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:10,240
against the government the government is

1190
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,640
not only one is

1191
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:17,839
the yeah so many inside

1192
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,240
okay okay thank you um

1193
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:20,240
amy

1194
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,560
okay for us i think what we have learned

1195
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:29,920
during this process is how to work

1196
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,279
together

1197
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,480
uh to make sure that we are

1198
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,280
in the same line and how we choose the

1199
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,720
case

1200
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,400
the situation and uh i think

1201
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:47,598
it is something you can see every day

1202
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,640
to see many energy working together to

1203
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:51,760
start

1204
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,960
and finish without any struggle

1205
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,720
or many problem with voices

1206
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:59,440
and i think then also we need to see our

1207
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:01,680
power

1208
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,839
and the capacities before going to the

1209
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,919
litigation

1210
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:07,359
yeah because for me i can say that

1211
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:10,800
without

1212
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:14,560
the expertise from our headquarters

1213
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,119
in london or without access now

1214
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:17,599
contribution media legal defense and

1215
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:20,800
other

1216
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,520
mgo it will be very difficult for us

1217
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:24,640
to go then we need to see what we have

1218
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,839
at lego

1219
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,799
at local stage and also what we can

1220
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:31,200
assert from

1221
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,720
the outside to bring it together and

1222
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,879
make sure that we can go

1223
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:35,759
and have something which can be very

1224
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:38,240
useful

1225
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:38,880
i think it is something i have learned

1226
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,520
and uh

1227
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:42,000
yeah for the future i think what we can

1228
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:45,040
do

1229
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,319
better is to coordinate more

1230
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:51,520
and have more proof i think there is

1231
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,720
a gaps on that way yeah i think

1232
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:57,200
we need to see technical practice to see

1233
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,640
how we can be very proactive when we see

1234
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,960
a shutdown

1235
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:01,759
in the country i think that it is a

1236
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,560
challenge

1237
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,800
and i hope we can have these capacities

1238
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,000
and

1239
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,359
if people or somebody have this capacity

1240
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,640
help us

1241
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:15,440
train us and then we can ourselves

1242
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,480
be in the position to have some element

1243
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:22,240
technical

1244
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:22,240
element to show the internet shutdown

1245
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:27,440
um great uh thank you for that and there

1246
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:29,200
is a really interesting point there like

1247
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,200
let you know knowing your capacity and

1248
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
that we can't just do this by ourself it

1249
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
has to be you know

1250
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,359
in collaboration with others with

1251
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,560
expertise and the challenges are also

1252
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:38,160
really sailing here

1253
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:40,240
um so we have another question from the

1254
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,560
audience and i'll read out the question

1255
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,720
and

1256
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,960
you know folks feel free to volunteer to

1257
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,598
answer in the litigations carried out so

1258
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,599
far and

1259
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,040
that are also ongoing what legal

1260
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:51,599
principles can one

1261
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:52,800
derive that are applicable to shutdowns

1262
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:56,800
um

1263
00:46:52,800 --> 00:47:00,079
mysec thanks um this is a

1264
00:46:56,800 --> 00:47:01,680
great question um we are trying to first

1265
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:02,400
of all you know analyze all of the

1266
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,040
judgments

1267
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,240
that are issued on internet shutdowns

1268
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,640
we've got a database

1269
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:10,160
tracking all the cases that we know of

1270
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:11,680
um that are brought

1271
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,759
against governments as well as against

1272
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:16,879
telcos for for shutting down for

1273
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:18,560
throttling um and denying service and so

1274
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,079
first of all like if you hear of those

1275
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:22,400
cases um please do

1276
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:24,319
get in touch with us at access now and

1277
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:26,480
keep it on

1278
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:27,680
a few principles that we've seen

1279
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,119
effective

1280
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:30,879
first is the principle of

1281
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:33,359
proportionality

1282
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:35,119
any interference with the rights of

1283
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:36,160
freedom of expression and access to

1284
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:38,880
information

1285
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:39,359
must be necessary and also proportionate

1286
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,520
and

1287
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,480
uh one thing that i think we've been

1288
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,720
able to

1289
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,880
stress about internet shutdowns is that

1290
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:50,640
they are disproportionate

1291
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:51,599
um almost as a rule and i think that is

1292
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:54,720
uh easy

1293
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:57,599
fairly simple for courts to grasp

1294
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:58,480
another principle to look into is is the

1295
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,160
fact that

1296
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,200
not only the substance matters the

1297
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,480
substance of our rights and how they're

1298
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,399
how they're interfered with and

1299
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,200
restricted unlawfully but also the

1300
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,480
process

1301
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,960
and we've seen a few rulings that um

1302
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:15,599
sort of put aside the substantive

1303
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:18,559
constitutional or human rights at issue

1304
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:20,160
and say that the process was the correct

1305
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,720
legal process wasn't followed the

1306
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:23,598
government

1307
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:25,680
aired um and uh therefore this their

1308
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,720
action was was null and void and not

1309
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,118
supported um not legal um

1310
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,839
and uh you know those rulings aren't um

1311
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,839
necessarily

1312
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,759
you know the full some judgment that we

1313
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:36,880
want but they do help end shutdowns

1314
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:39,920
quickly

1315
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:42,960
um and i would say yeah a final

1316
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:44,480
um principle uh that we can

1317
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:46,960
look to that that's coming out of these

1318
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,200
cases along with proportionality

1319
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,160
and process is that national security

1320
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:52,640
arguments um

1321
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:54,160
will be raised and they are formidable

1322
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,799
but they are not

1323
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,359
um they are not undefeatable they they

1324
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:59,440
can be

1325
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:00,720
overcome and that's you know one thing

1326
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,000
we saw in this

1327
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,598
ecowas ruling um on togo was that

1328
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,520
even though togo raised national

1329
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:09,359
security arguments saying that this

1330
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,000
interference was necessary

1331
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:13,040
um that the court was able to see beyond

1332
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,760
those and

1333
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:20,640
overcome that defense

1334
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:22,000
um thank you peter for that um saba or

1335
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:23,440
natalia if you want to come

1336
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:25,359
if you want if you have anything to add

1337
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:28,559
on on to this question

1338
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:31,839
i let me invite you to do that if not

1339
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,839
then i can move on to the next question

1340
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,000
okay silence is consensus um so natalya

1341
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:41,119
can you

1342
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,599
um because my understanding is that you

1343
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,280
know this

1344
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:46,160
this ruling as much as you know they're

1345
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,760
in our favor um and as much as you know

1346
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,279
as we like them and we're very happy

1347
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:51,680
that the way that they came out is that

1348
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:53,440
they don't necessarily outright ban

1349
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,799
uh you know internet shutdowns for the

1350
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:57,040
ruling in togo doesn't say

1351
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,480
the government should never ever ever

1352
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,960
you know shut down the internet ever

1353
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,040
again

1354
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,400
that's not the case so can you tell us

1355
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,440
you know what the shortcomings are and

1356
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:05,520
how we need to push

1357
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:08,240
a bit further or are we satisfied with

1358
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:08,240
what we have now

1359
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:12,160
thank you abraham yes so in the ecowas

1360
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,200
case uh

1361
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:17,920
the court uh overall ruled inconsistence

1362
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:20,000
with uh what we expected and talked a

1363
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,000
lot about with about the right to

1364
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:23,119
freedom of expression and how shutdowns

1365
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,200
violate that

1366
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:27,359
so the court said that actually access

1367
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,359
to internet is included within this

1368
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,160
right of freedom of expression

1369
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:34,000
and that uh this right requires

1370
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:37,200
protection of the law

1371
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:38,880
um and then it did rule that the actions

1372
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,960
of the government of togo

1373
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:43,200
violated this right because it was not

1374
00:50:40,960 --> 00:50:46,800
based in any legitimate purpose

1375
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,279
and it was not based in law uh however

1376
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,200
uh the court sort of didn't go beyond

1377
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:54,079
those parameters of the right to freedom

1378
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:56,078
of expression and its discussion uh

1379
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:58,800
which we actually encouraged the court

1380
00:50:56,079 --> 00:51:00,720
to do in our submission we wanted to the

1381
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:02,559
court to also consider

1382
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,720
other rights such as right to freedom of

1383
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:07,040
assembly but also the

1384
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:08,240
social economic economic rights such as

1385
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,520
the right to work

1386
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:14,399
education health and others

1387
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:14,880
and so this was something that we would

1388
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,960
like

1389
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:18,559
to see other courts do to look at these

1390
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,800
other rights because as peter

1391
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:22,800
said that internet is just so essential

1392
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:25,520
for our whole life

1393
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:26,800
and um we cannot ignore that

1394
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:29,040
significance

1395
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,000
another thing that sort of the court as

1396
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:33,119
also patrick

1397
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,599
mentioned in the previous session is

1398
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,280
that

1399
00:51:33,599 --> 00:51:37,200
the court within the within the

1400
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,359
parameter of the freedom of expression

1401
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,279
the court also didn't go beyond the

1402
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:44,558
first prong which is

1403
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:46,880
whether the shutdowns are based in law

1404
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,760
and as peter just said just mentioned

1405
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,240
that there's

1406
00:51:47,760 --> 00:51:51,760
several so there's uh it has to be based

1407
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,919
on law it has to be

1408
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,160
necessary and it has to be proportionate

1409
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,440
so the court didn't really look at those

1410
00:51:56,160 --> 00:52:00,558
other two

1411
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:04,000
uh prongs uh however it did say

1412
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:06,400
that um that you know the shutdowns were

1413
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,400
unlawful even just because of the you

1414
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,000
know just because of the first prong

1415
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,920
and that the government should not do

1416
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:14,880
that in the future and that

1417
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:16,559
uh if the government has obligations to

1418
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:19,599
then enact laws

1419
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:22,000
that would be consistent with this right

1420
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:23,440
and that would ensure protection to to

1421
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,400
the

1422
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,839
police citizens uh in contrast in

1423
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,839
indonesia case

1424
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:33,119
we saw that the courts actually looked

1425
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:35,680
at the proportionality principle

1426
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:37,440
it used its own sort of three-part test

1427
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,720
where they looked at

1428
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:44,079
um whether sort of the the the

1429
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:47,118
actions of the government were based on

1430
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,640
like observing public order religious

1431
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,960
moral values

1432
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:51,839
and the court in that case said yes it

1433
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:55,119
was

1434
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:57,359
um but the other two prongs which the

1435
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,760
court uses they said it was

1436
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:02,078
not based in law there was no existing

1437
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,200
law that allowed specifically shutdowns

1438
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,880
of the whole network

1439
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:09,359
versus just blocking of specific content

1440
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,119
and also the court mentioned that it was

1441
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:13,040
not proportional

1442
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:14,640
and so in this case it's sort of this

1443
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:17,119
court it went beyond

1444
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:18,000
uh sort of this just one lawfulness

1445
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:21,280
prong

1446
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:24,559
but uh it did not look at the necessity

1447
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,200
and another thing is that um that also i

1448
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:28,000
think

1449
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,720
safenet and elsam uh the parties to the

1450
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,280
case they

1451
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:33,118
they previously told us is that they

1452
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,680
they kind of have a sense that it might

1453
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:38,800
not be the court decision doesn't really

1454
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:40,480
go as much as the ecowas court decision

1455
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:42,319
it doesn't really say that okay the

1456
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:44,800
government should not do this anymore

1457
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:46,960
and it should enact certain laws

1458
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:48,880
so there is a sort of concern whether it

1459
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:50,240
will happen again and they might go and

1460
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:52,960
challenge it again

1461
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:55,439
so this is something where we think it

1462
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,559
doesn't go as far but we nevertheless

1463
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,480
are still very happy that we have these

1464
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:01,520
positive decisions and if we think that

1465
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,160
they still

1466
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:05,200
provide useful precedence for other

1467
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:08,879
courts and

1468
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,879
jurisdictions thank you

1469
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,319
um great thank you thank you so much

1470
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,160
natalia and we have

1471
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,759
a few minutes left so i i want to go

1472
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,680
back to ade and ami

1473
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:19,680
uh amy i want to ask you know what's

1474
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,279
next for you as as as

1475
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,040
organization so let's start with our day

1476
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,040
and then we can close off uh with with

1477
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,480
no we still have the article of the

1478
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:34,480
blocking

1479
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,920
the government use for the internet

1480
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,880
saturn and

1481
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,599
our plan uh yeah hope in the next month

1482
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:43,920
we will

1483
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:47,280
go to the uh conditional court to

1484
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:51,680
to filling the lawsuit this article

1485
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,640
because in in in our country is like

1486
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:56,960
government said this hawks and the

1487
00:54:54,640 --> 00:55:00,319
government also detected the

1488
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:02,640
content yeah everything

1489
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:03,359
from the government there is no udcl

1490
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:06,558
process

1491
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,480
and that's why i think it's very very

1492
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:13,359
important for us to

1493
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:15,920
against the yeah the potential

1494
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:18,078
yeah potential dictator like like that i

1495
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,079
think

1496
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:25,118
okay uh off to you amy yeah

1497
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:26,480
okay uh i think for us for the next step

1498
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:28,319
we will

1499
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,319
see how we'll have a plan for the

1500
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:31,279
implementation of the decision the cut

1501
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:34,079
decision

1502
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,760
because you have two or three points in

1503
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:38,799
the decision where you

1504
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:39,599
the government need to do new law for

1505
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,160
example

1506
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:43,119
then we need to wake up and make sure

1507
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,799
that

1508
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:50,480
a bad law because the authorities

1509
00:55:46,799 --> 00:55:53,920
can use the opportunities to

1510
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:55,440
do something against freedom of

1511
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:58,559
expression or

1512
00:55:55,440 --> 00:56:00,400
to say something on national security

1513
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:03,119
because you have in the north of the

1514
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:04,240
country some situation with burkina faso

1515
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:07,440
and mali

1516
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:10,959
then we hope that it will go

1517
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,440
it will go in in this way it is what we

1518
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:14,799
have

1519
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:18,079
and also about security issues for the
