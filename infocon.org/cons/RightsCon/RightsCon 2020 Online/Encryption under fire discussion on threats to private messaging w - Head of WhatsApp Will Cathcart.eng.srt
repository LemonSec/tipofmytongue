2
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
so

3
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,479
good evening everyone in 2016

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,079
a brazilian judge ordered the arrest of

5
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:43,360
facebook's vice president

6
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,600
in sao paulo brazil the reason whatsapp

7
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,759
refused to hand over messages pertaining

8
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,240
to a drug dealing investigation

9
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:51,439
whatsapp couldn't literally because of

10
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,039
encryption

11
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:55,119
i'm from brazil my name is mariana

12
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,000
valenci and i'm the director of

13
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,680
internet lab today i'm facilitating this

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,840
session about threats to encryption and

15
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,479
private messaging around the world

16
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,560
with will cathcart the head of whatsapp

17
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,478
who i'd like to welcome so

18
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,440
welcome and thanks will and thanks

19
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
everyone who's watching

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,839
imprisoning the vp of facebook is

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,760
probably one of the best known cases

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,720
illustrating the tension between

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,480
encryption advocates and law enforcement

24
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,120
since then whatsapp has twice been

25
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,079
blocked around across the entire country

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,160
of brazil for similar reasons law

27
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,720
enforcement asking for whatsapp message

28
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,599
content that could not be accessed

29
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,680
these are times of intense and and

30
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:38,480
preceding and global challenge to global

31
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,440
health

32
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,440
as well as to democracy and human rights

33
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,319
digital technology are central to these

34
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,640
challenges

35
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,000
causing renewed and lively discussions

36
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,279
about encryption

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,120
and private messaging so to warm up

38
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
what do you make of the situation will

39
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,920
how do you perceive the value

40
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,440
of encryption to rights with the

41
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,920
perspective that we're hearing a lot

42
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,800
about

43
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,679
these days that it somehow compromises

44
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,040
or

45
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,280
interferes with security or even public

46
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,280
health

47
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,120
yeah absolutely thank you mariana for

48
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,560
posting this conversation and

49
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,640
thank you everyone who's listening in

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,680
for all the work you do to protect human

51
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,599
rights

52
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,599
we're excited or i'm excited about a

53
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:22,799
human right we hold dear whatsapp

54
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,079
and we think it's increasingly important

55
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,760
in the digital age which is the right to

56
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,519
have a private conversation

57
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,280
online just as private as you would have

58
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,760
had in the real world

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,879
um you know you mentioned public health

60
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,359
and i think it's

61
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:37,280
important to note that the coronavirus

62
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,959
has changed our world

63
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
in a lot of ways but one way it's

64
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,840
changed it has forced us to have

65
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,079
conversations digitally

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
that used to be in person you and i are

67
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,599
talking over video today instead of in

68
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,119
person and all of wright's gone has been

69
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,720
over video and remote instead of

70
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,720
together and physical

71
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,319
and i think um what we're seeing is an

72
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,319
acceleration of the trend

73
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,679
that our lives are happening online and

74
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,599
things we used to be able to do face to

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,319
face we now do digitally

76
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,959
we've certainly seen that at whatsapp in

77
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,879
april

78
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:06,879
we saw a large increase in usage of our

79
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,560
services with over 100

80
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,239
billion messages being delivered a day

81
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
over 15 million minutes

82
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,840
of voice and video calls and we've done

83
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,120
what we can to support that from the

84
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:17,120
reliability of the service

85
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,040
to expanding features like allowing

86
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,440
group calls of up to eight people

87
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:23,600
um as well as you know partnering where

88
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,240
appropriate to offer services like

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
health information lines from the who or

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,680
domestic violence abuse lines in

91
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,280
argentina and chile so victims who were

92
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,600
stuck at home could reach out

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,400
and get help but the most amazing thing

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,240
is not sort of

95
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,159
you know what we've done or the the

96
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,520
overall usage numbers what's most

97
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,960
amazing is the stories of how people are

98
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,198
communicating digitally

99
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:44,638
doctors having sessions with patients

100
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,040
digitally instead of in person

101
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,720
lawyers doing their work remotely been

102
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:51,280
stories of courts in brazil and india

103
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,040
using whatsapp to conduct court business

104
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,359
and i think the you know important

105
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,400
question for our age is

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,600
are we going to live in a world where

107
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,799
that's possible where you can have those

108
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,240
conversations digitally

109
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,240
we don't think it's an accident that

110
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,759
people have felt comfortable doing that

111
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,360
these last few months we think it comes

112
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:06,880
from an ability to trust

113
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
that the technology is keeping those

114
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
conversations private

115
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,000
very very very sensitive conversations

116
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,240
that you wouldn't be willing to have

117
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,280
unless you knew they were private um and

118
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,320
you know this and many of the people

119
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,919
listening know this but

120
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,520
we use a technology called end-to-end

121
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:20,880
encryption that secures that that gives

122
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,639
you the confidence

123
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,400
that no one can hear your messages but

124
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,600
or share your calls but for those who

125
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,080
aren't familiar with it

126
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,680
what end-to-end encryption is is it's a

127
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,120
technology where if you send a message

128
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,080
to someone or you say something in a

129
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,759
call

130
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,840
it's scrambled from when it leaves your

131
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
phone to when it gets to the recipient

132
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,560
and no one along the way can listen to

133
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:42,320
it or read it not even whatsapp

134
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,680
and we think this is critical if you're

135
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,440
going to have a really important

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
sensitive conversation digitally

137
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
you need to know that no one can listen

138
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,198
it

139
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
this is important online because as we

140
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
all know there are growing numbers of

141
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,880
threats to

142
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,400
your conversations there's hackers

143
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,840
there's criminals but there's also

144
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,039
foreign intelligence services and

145
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,880
governments around the world who want to

146
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,080
snoop in on what people are doing

147
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,120
and end-to-end encryption protects

148
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,240
people from that it protects

149
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
whistleblowers when they talk to

150
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,160
journalists it protects

151
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
journalists in general in places where

152
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,280
freedom of speech is at risk

153
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,479
vulnerable communities everywhere

154
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,799
at-risk groups and

155
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,159
oppressive regimes so we think it's

156
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,520
really really critical

157
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,720
for all the reasons all the types of

158
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
conversations we're having digitally and

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,600
especially

160
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,360
for groups that are you know laboring to

161
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,120
advance the cause of human rights

162
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,479
and unfortunately as you mentioned kind

163
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,600
of the theme of what i'm hoping to talk

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:29,680
about today

165
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,440
this is this is under threat this is not

166
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,639
a given that we'll be able to offer

167
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,520
services

168
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,720
and companies will be able to offer

169
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,479
services that contain the level of

170
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,919
security of end and encryption

171
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,840
governments have advocated against this

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,000
for a long time you mentioned some of

173
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,280
the history in brazil

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,360
going about the last few years but even

175
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,400
more recently in brazil there's

176
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
discussion of

177
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,560
a law that would require a concept

178
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,560
called traceability um letting

179
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,680
requiring companies to help trace who

180
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:56,479
started a message that

181
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,759
ended up getting forwarded on um in

182
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,919
australia the uk

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
us there have been various discussions

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,799
around you know attempting to force

185
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,160
companies

186
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
to lower the security they offer or even

187
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,280
legislate against it

188
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,919
and we think this is a really really

189
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,119
important

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,719
decision we feel very strongly

191
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
that we need to offer the most secure

192
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,479
product and we feel very strongly that's

193
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,440
the right thing for the world

194
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,599
and in part what we're hoping to help

195
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,479
raise awareness around is that this

196
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:27,039
feels new this feels like a new debate

197
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:30,159
because

198
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,039
it's a digital space but it shouldn't

199
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
feel new

200
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,919
what we're really just debating is

201
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,599
should you have the right to have a

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,240
private conversation with someone

203
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:40,000
or should technology break that because

204
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,000
we've had private conversations for

205
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
all of human history and the fact that

206
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,720
we're now having them digitally is just

207
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
a change of technology it shouldn't

208
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,520
change our rights

209
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:48,878
and we think when you think about it

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,000
that way when you start to think about

211
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,360
you know what would make sense in the

212
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,160
real physical world

213
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,240
the answers become obvious for example

214
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
we're reaching a point as a society

215
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,080
where you could build the technology to

216
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,280
put a camera with a microphone in

217
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,919
everyone's living room all around the

218
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,000
world

219
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,359
hooked up to a central server somewhere

220
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,720
so that governments or law enforcement

221
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,319
could access them

222
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,319
to watch in a room if they thought a

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,400
crime was going on um

224
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,440
and everyone would recoil at that idea

225
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,878
certainly everyone here and i think

226
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,160
everyone in almost any context would

227
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:17,840
listen to that idea and say that's

228
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,879
insane we wouldn't do that

229
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,960
yet somehow when we have the

230
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
conversation around the digital world it

231
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,198
feels new so it feels like a fresh

232
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,759
debate

233
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,960
and we don't think it should and so you

234
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,720
know i think

235
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,000
what we're really trying to do is raise

236
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,800
awareness that these debates are going

237
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,479
on

238
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,080
and get you know many many many people

239
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:35,519
have helped make the case about the

240
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,680
important freedoms at stake here

241
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,039
but help make sure that everyone who can

242
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,399
is raising their voice

243
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,679
to be really clear so we make the right

244
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,679
choice for for society

245
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:51,680
we're saying about the importance of

246
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:54,560
private communications for

247
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,479
social movements activists lawyers

248
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,880
vulnerable communities and

249
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,120
so that a space of non-surveillance can

250
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,839
exist in the digital world

251
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:05,920
but i guess we need to dig a bit deeper

252
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,920
into the reasons why governments

253
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,719
and law enforcement oppose encryption

254
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,760
right so when we look at the grounds

255
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,640
on which the legitimacy of encryption is

256
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,959
challenged

257
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,880
around the world we see that the

258
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,880
narratives have developed differently

259
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,399
in different jurisdictions right we see

260
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:25,600
talks in the us

261
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,279
and the uk around national security and

262
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,600
the investigation of crimes

263
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,800
especially terrorism drug dealing sexual

264
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
abuse

265
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,560
we see certain encrypted technologies

266
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,880
bending china for example

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,560
on the grounds of controlling speech i

268
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,160
guess

269
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,920
and more recently this information

270
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,480
has been a concern driving discussions

271
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,839
in latin america and india for example

272
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,959
so can you speak a bit on about the

273
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,040
different

274
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,160
regional trends that you observe around

275
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,800
the globe

276
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,240
and i guess it could be interesting if

277
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:01,519
you could also comment

278
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,600
on the differences or similarities

279
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,360
that you see from supposed democratic

280
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,079
countries when compared to

281
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,279
more authoritarian ones when it comes to

282
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:12,319
how they approach

283
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,360
the regulation of encryption yeah

284
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,200
absolutely

285
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,640
i mean i think the most important thing

286
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
to to focus on

287
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,279
is exactly what you bring up which is

288
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,680
this debate is going on all around the

289
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,519
world

290
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,880
in a bunch of different countries and we

291
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:24,320
shouldn't make the mistake of not

292
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:25,600
realizing that that debate is having in

293
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,880
different places even though it sounds

294
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,680
different

295
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,320
because the threat is the same and what

296
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:32,399
happens

297
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,959
in a specific country around encryption

298
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,959
could impact people in other countries

299
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,399
you know for example you know the debate

300
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,359
in the u.s around legislation on

301
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,880
encryption

302
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
wouldn't just affect people in the us it

303
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,079
would affect people all around the world

304
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
if they happen to use any service

305
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:48,399
um where the the company or provider

306
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,160
provide about it is subject to u.s law

307
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,360
um similarly you know a lot of places

308
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
around the world as you mentioned have

309
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,959
talked

310
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,640
around the edges of end-to-end

311
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,920
encryption they haven't wanted to come

312
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,319
out and say

313
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,680
and and encryption itself should be

314
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,279
illegal it should go away because they

315
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,359
haven't wanted to sort of

316
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,560
you know openly kind of say they want

317
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,680
that big of a trade-off to people's

318
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,560
privacy

319
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
they've danced around it with

320
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,920
suggestions of okay let's let's require

321
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
the collection of more other types of

322
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,240
data

323
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,600
oh we still think end encryption is okay

324
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,880
but here's a set of changes you need to

325
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
make

326
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
but i think the reality is that the the

327
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:21,120
growing loud

328
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:23,920
debate in australia the uk and the us

329
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,600
has emboldened people in other countries

330
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,800
who might not have wanted to openly

331
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,880
challenge end and encryption to now

332
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:32,560
challenge it more forcefully

333
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:34,399
and i think that's a problem um you know

334
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,359
lastly i guess the point i'd make you

335
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,399
you talk about the difference kind of

336
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,959
between

337
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,560
um you know more liberal democratic

338
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:42,319
societies with a history of rule of law

339
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,839
and respect for human rights and more

340
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,760
authoritarian ones

341
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,200
you know one problem is we're no longer

342
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:50,000
living in a world

343
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
of um separate communication systems by

344
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,560
country

345
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,639
we're living in a world of global

346
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:58,079
communication and

347
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:01,360
if you if you propose weakening security

348
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,079
in a um you know a west a

349
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,800
democratic liberal human rights uh

350
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,839
traditional

351
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,279
country the reality is one people in

352
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,000
that country are going to be subject to

353
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:13,279
surveillance

354
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:14,720
and spying from authoritarian regimes

355
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,360
you know if you live in the united

356
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,720
states the reality is some parts of your

357
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:19,600
personal information have likely been

358
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
stolen

359
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,800
by people working for the military in

360
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,079
china you know i mean even just the

361
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
equifax hack

362
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,599
for example um and i think if there were

363
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
a hole in your communications you would

364
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,200
absolutely expect

365
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:32,239
spying from all around the world and two

366
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,160
you know if

367
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,519
you create a hole in a country with

368
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,639
strong rule of law in a global

369
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,240
communication system

370
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,279
it's gonna be an issue all around the

371
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,040
world because every government's going

372
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,240
to ask to use it they're going to ask

373
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,599
and do everything they can to try to get

374
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,399
access to people's private conversations

375
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,399
we think that's really bad

376
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,680
just a follow-up question on that one of

377
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,880
the arguments we hear often

378
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:57,680
from law enforcement is the going dark

379
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,880
argument meaning that investigators are

380
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:02,160
left with

381
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,839
no evidence if all communications are

382
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,040
encrypted what do you make of that

383
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
yeah thank you for bringing it up

384
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:10,399
because i think it's really important

385
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
to talk about that you know when it's

386
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,839
framed that way obviously a lot of

387
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,399
people hear that and say well well gee i

388
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:15,839
don't want

389
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,880
law enforcement to have no data i don't

390
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:18,160
want to take the world to go dark on

391
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:20,079
them that sounds bad

392
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,519
but it's just it's just not the reality

393
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,199
the reality is not

394
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,959
that law enforcement is somehow living

395
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,560
in a world that's going dark

396
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:28,479
i would argue law enforcement is living

397
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,920
in a world of kind of a golden age of

398
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:33,040
surveillance there is more

399
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:34,639
data about our lives online captured by

400
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,120
the devices we carry around with us

401
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:38,880
than ever before you know here in the us

402
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
law enforcement can go to

403
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,560
phone manufacturers go to apple and

404
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,240
google and with a warrant saying tell us

405
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:46,079
everyone who is in this geographic

406
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,120
location at these times

407
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,120
that's a thing you never would have

408
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:52,079
dreamed of before and

409
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,199
i think it's perfectly reasonable to say

410
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,040
that

411
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:56,639
private messages messages you send to

412
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,639
one other person private calls you have

413
00:13:56,639 --> 00:14:00,079
with one other person are so sensitive

414
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:02,000
that they shouldn't all live on some

415
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:03,680
server somewhere

416
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,279
that that's just too big a risk to take

417
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:08,399
with people's privacy

418
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,839
um and and and yet that doesn't mean

419
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,880
that law enforcement's gonna then live

420
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:13,390
in a world where there's nothing it's

421
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:15,199
just not the reality

422
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:17,920
[Music]

423
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,639
well uh thanks going back to that talk

424
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,920
about

425
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,079
local regulations um i think many

426
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,000
here know and will mention it already

427
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:28,959
too that we're currently discussing a

428
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,240
fake nose bill in brazil and one of the

429
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,880
things that the current

430
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,000
version of the bill addresses is

431
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:37,199
investigations

432
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:38,160
in private messaging and this process

433
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:40,240
seems like

434
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,240
an interesting hook to a few discussions

435
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:44,639
that we could have here

436
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:46,639
so there's a considerable concern in

437
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:49,199
brazil at this moment that

438
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:49,920
whatsapp and other messaging apps that

439
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,639
deploy

440
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,959
end-to-end encryption have been central

441
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,519
to

442
00:14:52,959 --> 00:14:58,638
disinformation campaigns in recent years

443
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,120
and elections

444
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,000
a few stakeholders have been drawing on

445
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,079
a distinction

446
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,440
made in the literature between private

447
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,638
communications and mass

448
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,120
communications arguing that such

449
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,040
apps have the protection of private

450
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,000
communications but they have actually

451
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,319
been serving

452
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,360
as broadcasters of information to the

453
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,720
public

454
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:24,000
and information that goes unchecked

455
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,399
and is untraceable so what do you

456
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,360
think of this what's your take on this

457
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:30,480
distinction

458
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,360
and what what's up serving too yeah

459
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,399
absolutely

460
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,160
i mean we really agree with the

461
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:35,920
distinction between private

462
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,959
communication is different than sort of

463
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,240
a public forum

464
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,758
broadcast medium you know we think of it

465
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,199
that way we think of whatsapp

466
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,120
and private messaging is different than

467
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:47,680
a public social network

468
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:49,279
like facebook or instagram or twitter uh

469
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,638
and we think people's expectations

470
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:52,079
are very different right they know that

471
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,720
if they're saying something to everyone

472
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,160
and they know

473
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,240
everyone in their network that's

474
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
different than if they're messaging

475
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,040
something to one other person or having

476
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,199
a call with someone else they expect

477
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,800
much higher levels of privacy there

478
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,920
um and yeah i mean there's been there

479
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,639
have been real legitimate questions

480
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,839
around

481
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:07,199
you know even though whatsapp was

482
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,480
designed and intended as a private

483
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,758
communication medium

484
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,320
did some of the feature set mean it

485
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,839
could be used more as a broadcast one

486
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,519
our solution to that is to say

487
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,880
we should change the feature set you

488
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,360
know we really believe this should be a

489
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,800
private communication service

490
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,720
the overwhelming majority of messages

491
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,639
are one-to-one messages but let's change

492
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,199
some of the functionality so

493
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,480
we've done things like limit who you can

494
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,920
forward to i think this is you know more

495
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,079
since the last election in brazil for

496
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,680
example you can only forward a message

497
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:35,680
at once to five other

498
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,599
chats rather than kind of unlimited and

499
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
much more recently actually in april or

500
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,320
or may

501
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,079
um uh you know with with the rise of

502
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,040
coronavirus we decided to make a change

503
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,800
where

504
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,240
if you forwarded a messages a message

505
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,800
and it's gone more than five hops it's

506
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,880
been forwarded

507
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,560
more than five times there's no quick

508
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
forward button uh you have to kind of

509
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,959
hunt around to find the forward

510
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,800
functionality and if you do you can only

511
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:58,160
forward it to one person at a time

512
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,880
and there's other limits like groups can

513
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,079
only have 256 members etc but in general

514
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,160
just trying to change the product to be

515
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,198
a little more um

516
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,919
to match kind of the private

517
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:10,480
communication medium we intended to be

518
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:12,240
and the second is you know go do what we

519
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,839
can with the data we do have to root out

520
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,240
some of the bad behavior for example

521
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,480
there

522
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,240
you know we're stories of politicians

523
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,120
setting up you know thousands of fake

524
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,799
accounts

525
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:23,280
uh with their political operation to get

526
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:25,280
a message out and we're now using

527
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,799
uh patterns of behavior and automation

528
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,399
to find uh and ban

529
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,000
those accounts we now ban over two

530
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,520
million accounts for spam and things

531
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,120
like that each month

532
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,360
um but what we don't think is the right

533
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,959
solution is to go mandate that the

534
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
privacy and security for everyone just

535
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,000
goes down

536
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,039
um we think it's much much better for

537
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,120
people to have a true private

538
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,080
communication medium that stays private

539
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,280
and the other thing i'd say about you

540
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,240
know traceability in brazil because he

541
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,879
brought it up and i think it's a really

542
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,440
important

543
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,559
topic for everyone here to understand is

544
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,520
you know that the concern around

545
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:53,520
misinformation is

546
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,559
is real and legitimate but the solution

547
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:58,000
being proposed is

548
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,120
pretty scary it's the idea that if

549
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,320
the police think that someone forwarded

550
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,760
something on that was fake

551
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:06,080
they should be able to track down the

552
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,720
people who shared it um and go talk to

553
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:08,000
them and just

554
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:09,440
think about that right like the idea of

555
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,160
someone coming and knocking on your door

556
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,960
and saying

557
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,160
you shared something that's fake or

558
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,200
dangerous

559
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,640
or untrue uh to one other person you

560
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,200
know you message one other person with

561
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,440
it

562
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,200
that's pretty crazy um and not to paint

563
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,720
too dire of a picture

564
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
but they're pretty clear examples of

565
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:28,720
that leading to you know horrible

566
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,280
regimes all around the world

567
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,559
i mean in in china for example messaging

568
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,360
works very differently the messaging

569
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,440
services there

570
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,479
are monitored what you you know they do

571
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,919
look for you know

572
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,400
quote unquote misinformation or fake

573
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,760
news as defined by them

574
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,919
there's been a ton of reporting on this

575
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,640
about how you know with the with the

576
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,320
coronavirus appearing in wuhan a lot of

577
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:49,600
really really brave doctors

578
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,360
shared information about what they were

579
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,520
seeing over messaging

580
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,559
um and in some cases got kind of in

581
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
trouble or told that what they were

582
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,280
doing was destabilizing or fake and they

583
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,760
shouldn't share it and it was only

584
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,799
because they

585
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:02,160
persisted and you know found used code

586
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,240
words and found clever ways to get the

587
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:05,600
information out that it did get out

588
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,760
and i don't i don't think we want to

589
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,039
live in that world

590
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,640
and there's got to be you know other

591
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,200
approaches that are much more reasonable

592
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,960
for

593
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:15,919
helping to dispel rumors and get

594
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,919
accurate information out

595
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:21,919
good i think it's a good idea to go

596
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:23,360
a little bit deeper into the

597
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:26,000
traceability

598
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,039
requirement that's being proposed in the

599
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:31,679
brazilian bill

600
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,760
so the idea it's a very controversial

601
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:35,360
proposal which stems from the idea that

602
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:38,240
law enforcement has to be me

603
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:40,080
to be made able to identify the source

604
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
of matched messages that are broadcast

605
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,799
as well

606
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,919
we're seeing right but using metadata

607
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,559
retention

608
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
so what it requires is that messaging

609
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,760
apps retain

610
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
data on who forwarded a certain message

611
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,200
and when

612
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,160
under certain circumstances that would

613
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,440
characterize

614
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:59,520
mass forwarding but some of us

615
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,280
stakeholders including myself

616
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:03,039
are deeply concerned about how that

617
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,639
could lead to mass surveillance and

618
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:07,520
enable new forms of

619
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:08,799
political persecution and moreover be

620
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,960
ineffective

621
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:12,000
so you were mentioning the china case

622
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:15,200
but

623
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:18,559
um i wanted to hear from you

624
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,360
two things still um how do you see

625
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,320
that traceability duties that require

626
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:26,399
just metadata retention

627
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,399
if there's no provision on disclosing

628
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,600
the content of communications how would

629
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,679
that affect

630
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:35,760
users privacy and the second thing is

631
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,760
one of the things that's been discussed

632
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,200
is that this would be data

633
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,520
that whatsapp already collects so i

634
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,440
think

635
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,960
one important thing for you to to talk

636
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,880
about would be

637
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,039
what's the scope of metadata that you

638
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:52,080
collect and already provide

639
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:53,280
to law enforcement worldwide yeah

640
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,240
absolutely

641
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,678
i mean the most important thing about

642
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,120
the data we have is that what we don't

643
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
have which is the the content of the

644
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,320
messages the calls the video chats you

645
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:01,120
make we can't have it because of endnote

646
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,360
encryption

647
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,799
but yeah we do we do have some data our

648
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,120
philosophy is to be

649
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,400
as minimal as we need to be to collect

650
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:11,039
and kind of reliably

651
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,240
run the service uh and keep keep it you

652
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,440
know secure and safe

653
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,679
but we do have some things like for

654
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:17,200
example ip address but we don't have

655
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:18,880
anything near

656
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,159
what's being asked in the traceability

657
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,280
legislation which is why we're fighting

658
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,559
it right it's why we're fighting is we

659
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,200
don't want to collect this data

660
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,799
you know for example we don't have a way

661
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,240
to look up if if someone brings us a

662
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,679
message who's the person who sent it and

663
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,200
we don't we don't even have you know

664
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:33,120
who are all the people everyone on the

665
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,880
services message we don't we don't

666
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,799
have that data and we don't want to have

667
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,360
that data and so i think the

668
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,600
you know the main takeaway here is i

669
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,439
think to be wary of legislation

670
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:47,840
uh of regulation that would require

671
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,360
companies in general messaging services

672
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,639
specifically especially

673
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,479
to collect data they don't want to

674
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,919
collect you know we don't want this data

675
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,960
we don't think we need this data and we

676
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,039
don't think you should want us to have

677
00:21:54,960 --> 00:22:01,440
this data

678
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,158
i'll go back to this but i just wanted

679
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:04,320
to

680
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:05,200
um ask something else regarding what you

681
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,080
were saying

682
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,960
uh about government spying on doctors

683
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,918
for example

684
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:13,679
you gave a very concrete example of

685
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,960
government spying on people the case of

686
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,919
doctors in china

687
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:19,679
but speaking of that um of other

688
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,280
governments around the world

689
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:23,280
i understand one of the issues that

690
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:25,039
whatsapp's dealing with right now for

691
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,158
example in the nso group

692
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:30,960
lawsuit is spyware

693
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,880
can you speak a bit on the state of that

694
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:36,400
worldwide

695
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,679
yeah absolutely so um yeah we've been

696
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,760
we've been really public around this we

697
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:41,440
found a you know found a vulnerability

698
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,919
uh that was being exploited

699
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,720
by a spyware organization we fixed did

700
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:45,760
the obvious thing we fixed the

701
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,760
vulnerability

702
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,919
you know investigated reached out to the

703
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,559
people we think had been affected by it

704
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,840
um but we we felt we needed to do more

705
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:55,520
and we've we have filed a lawsuit

706
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:57,120
against nso group i can't get into a lot

707
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:58,000
of the specifics with them because of

708
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
the lawsuit

709
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,880
but let me just talk for a second about

710
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
the industry and the trend here because

711
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,840
i think it's really important and in

712
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,640
particular really important for this

713
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,639
group

714
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,679
there is this growing industry of

715
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,640
companies that create

716
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,240
hacking software spyware and sell it all

717
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,000
around the world

718
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,600
and this this software is horrifying you

719
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:18,640
know it exploits vulnerabilities

720
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,918
in your phone operating system to let

721
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,679
the person spying

722
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,200
do unbelievable things you know not just

723
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:25,280
read everything on your phone

724
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:26,240
but like you know potentially turn on

725
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:28,158
the camera

726
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:29,679
silently turn on the microphone silently

727
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:30,559
track the physical location of the

728
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,320
device

729
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:34,639
at a distance get alerts if you go to a

730
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,000
specific area it's pretty horrifying

731
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,679
and the industry says they do this for

732
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,720
legitimate law enforcement purposes you

733
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:41,200
know they talk about

734
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:43,760
fighting terrorism etc but the research

735
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:45,200
on this is quite clear that in practice

736
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,879
these tools are not being used for that

737
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,320
they're being widely abused

738
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,559
you know there's research with citizen

739
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,080
lab out of toronto it's really really

740
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:53,760
really amazing work

741
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,760
um it's tracked a lot of this down to

742
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:57,279
who are the actual people who are being

743
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:58,799
targeted and it's just horrifying

744
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:01,279
examples of journalists

745
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,279
human rights advocates you know

746
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,960
government officials

747
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,480
religious leaders just kind of people

748
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:07,919
you know a lot of people all around the

749
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,120
world who are fighting for human rights

750
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,520
and democracy

751
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:13,678
being targeted and being spied on in

752
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:15,600
really really horrifying ways and so

753
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,039
we think this industry is out of control

754
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,360
i think governments should be stepping

755
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,320
in

756
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:21,199
to stop it and more broadly you know for

757
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,480
everyone here

758
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,320
wanna make sure everyone knows this is

759
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,440
happening so you know one you can keep

760
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,439
yourself safe

761
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,559
and learn what you can do to protect

762
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,279
yourself

763
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,200
and two you know help help as best you

764
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:34,799
can create awareness and pressure that

765
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:37,360
this is completely unacceptable and it

766
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,360
has to stop

767
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:43,678
okay so we're unfortunately heading to

768
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,960
the final questions

769
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:48,880
and i think it's essential to finish

770
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
this interview by addressing some hard

771
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,880
questions

772
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,600
so i'll start with the first that has

773
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,720
been voiced

774
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:58,000
by civil society and the technical

775
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:00,799
community

776
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
who see end-to-end encryption as a tool

777
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:03,039
for furthering

778
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,640
right so just to make sure we're

779
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:05,919
speaking of people who support

780
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,520
encryption

781
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,360
uh but the question is as whatsapp moves

782
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:13,120
to this direction of incorporating new

783
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,959
services such as pension

784
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,039
and insurance in india or what's at pay

785
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:20,720
in different countries are we talking of

786
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,240
a model that would require

787
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:27,840
more metadata retention to work or

788
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,200
even the integration with other users

789
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,799
user databases such as facebook's

790
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,559
how to deal with the fact for example

791
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,158
that whatsapp and facebook

792
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,000
seem to rely on very different

793
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:40,400
principles around

794
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,039
data collection news and don't you see

795
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,640
that

796
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:46,400
as a contradiction yeah

797
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,840
great questions i think you know on new

798
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,840
services we're going to build an

799
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,480
offer uh you know you're absolutely

800
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,240
right they they'll they may require

801
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,520
different functionality or even even

802
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,720
different pieces of data

803
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,879
our philosophy on it's going to be the

804
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,240
same which is you know how do we offer a

805
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,720
great service with the minimal data we

806
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,320
need

807
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
how we how can we be really clear about

808
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,439
that um and so i think you'll see yes

809
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
for example

810
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,799
uh with things like payments you may

811
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,639
need to enter some of your

812
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,240
your credit card or debit card or bank

813
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,360
information um

814
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,960
that you're you know to connect with

815
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,000
your bank but we'll build it in such a

816
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,360
way as to minimize

817
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,400
uh what we have and we think it'll be

818
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
reasonable and we think it'll be good

819
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,600
for the people who want to use it

820
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,600
um but the more broad one you brought up

821
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:24,158
i think is is you know thank you for

822
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,520
bringing up i think

823
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:27,039
it's a really great example we think of

824
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,240
you know we think of a public social

825
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,960
network and a private messaging service

826
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,000
is different

827
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:31,919
we think people have different

828
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,200
expectations for them and they should

829
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,640
and it is

830
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,919
not a contribution for a private

831
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,760
messaging service to be really really

832
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:39,600
really private

833
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:41,360
and facebook's had that position for a

834
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,158
long time that's actually why

835
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:45,120
you know after uh facebook acquired

836
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:46,400
whatsapp whatsapp

837
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,239
went and built and added end to end

838
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
encryption with facebook support

839
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,600
was it felt like the right model for

840
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,559
private messaging

841
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,760
and i think that you know the final

842
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,120
thing one of the beauties of end

843
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,879
encryption and beauties of building a

844
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,479
service that's really private is

845
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,000
we kind of agree you shouldn't have to

846
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,240
trust uh

847
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,840
the service provider you're using be it

848
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:05,919
a company or whoever

849
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:06,879
you just should know that they don't

850
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:08,240
have your messages

851
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,360
and you shouldn't have to worry about it

852
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,640
and so one of the great things about

853
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,600
encryption is it just removes that need

854
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,120
to trust

855
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,360
that need to worry about you know even

856
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,559
just a mistake or a hacker

857
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:19,279
getting access to your messages because

858
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,279
it's not possible

859
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:26,080
thanks we went speak addressing another

860
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:29,760
the second question

861
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,480
which i think has to do with how to

862
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:33,520
trust

863
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,760
that you don't have to trust

864
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,960
the technical community often voices

865
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:40,080
that

866
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,720
secure end-to-end encryption

867
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,399
requires free or open software so that

868
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,640
one can be sure

869
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:47,600
of its working through auditing for

870
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:51,360
example

871
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,439
so why has whatsapp not moved to that

872
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,600
direction

873
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,880
yeah great question i mean you're

874
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,080
absolutely right you need to have a

875
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,080
service where people

876
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,158
can trust that they don't have to trust

877
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,600
so to speak um and

878
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,440
and open software is a great way to do

879
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,199
that in fact we use

880
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:09,279
the uh signal protocol for end

881
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,279
encryption side whatsapp which is open

882
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:12,480
um and that that's one great technique

883
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,919
and i think there's others too

884
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,760
you know we've done white papers for

885
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,279
example on how our technology works

886
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:21,600
we benefit a lot from the scrutiny

887
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:22,640
um that we receive as a really really

888
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,158
popular app

889
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,640
you know anytime we release a new app

890
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,320
into the the play store or the app store

891
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,840
researchers go look at the binary and

892
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:31,840
study it and i think you know

893
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,039
i'm confident that if they would be able

894
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:35,279
to detect any sort of

895
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,720
um changes in how we were implementing

896
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,399
encryption et cetera

897
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,360
um so i think but i think that you're

898
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,639
right there's a lot of ways to build

899
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,000
trust here and over time you know we

900
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:44,559
should look at more of them whether it's

901
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:47,760
opening up more of our software

902
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,960
more scrutiny third-party audits etc

903
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,000
and i think you'll see us do that over

904
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,480
the next few years as we build more

905
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,480
functionality

906
00:28:53,120 --> 00:29:00,479
good that's really good to hear and well

907
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:03,120
we only got two minutes left so

908
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,840
do you want to finish by saying how you

909
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,959
see the

910
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:10,720
future ahead in terms of encryption

911
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,279
and challenges to encryption please

912
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,960
your last missed yes yeah i mean i i

913
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,520
don't know i'll tell you what i hope

914
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:19,120
which is i hope that um you know one of

915
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,240
one of the small things we'll realize

916
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,678
out of this year

917
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,760
and how much we've had to have all of

918
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:25,120
our human interactions digitally is just

919
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,720
how important this is

920
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,559
and that will create the awareness to

921
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,840
make sure governments

922
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,879
protect our right to private

923
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,678
communication rather than try to

924
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,600
undermine it

925
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:34,960
you know i was struck by seeing a an

926
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,360
image of

927
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,640
a cabinet meeting in a democracy that

928
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,840
was held over video conferencing

929
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,039
software it wasn't whatsapp it was you

930
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,840
know a different service someone tweeted

931
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,200
out a photo

932
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,279
of a grid of all these government

933
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,720
leaders and i thought to myself

934
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:48,159
my god that better be end-to-end

935
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,039
encrypted it's a cabinet meeting of you

936
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:51,200
know a government

937
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:52,158
that's a huge security issue and so my

938
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:53,360
hope is

939
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:55,360
this is going to raise awareness and

940
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,479
people are going to realize and make the

941
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,240
right decision

942
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,600
uh and we'll get to enjoy for the next

943
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,520
generation or more the

944
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:03,279
the privacy we've had with private

945
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:08,639
communication that we've enjoyed before

946
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:12,720
the world went digital

947
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,200
okay thanks will let's hope

948
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:17,360
um i thank you very much for this

949
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:21,279
conversation i think

950
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,479
it's been very enlighting um

951
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,559
and i really hope we move to a future

952
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:31,600
in which encryption is understood

953
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:32,799
as a support for rights um fundamental

954
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,879
rights

955
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,080
and that we get out of this current

956
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:38,960
situation

957
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,039
we're in at a better place for

958
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:43,520
technology policies

959
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,600
so thank you very much thank for thank

960
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,480
you everyone who's watching

961
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,279
and see you around see you next time

962
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,120
yeah

963
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,480
and thank you so much mariana for this

964
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,199
conversation and for everyone watching

965
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,480
thank you for the

966
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,320
chance to talk about this and thank you

967
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:05,840
for everything you do to protect all of

968
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:05,840
our rights

969
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:07,600
you
