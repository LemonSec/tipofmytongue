a commissioner of the federal

25
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,158
communications commission with us today

26
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,919
welcome and thank you so much for being

27
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,240

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,159
well thank you dara it's a treat to be

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,399
here at writescon to be here with you

30
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,400
uh virtually and i'm going to just give

31
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
a few opening remarks just to sort of

32
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
set the stage

33
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,439
first of all it is a privilege to kick

34
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,119
off what's become

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
really the world's leading summit on

36
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,680
human rights in the digital age and

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,919
you know these are historic days we've

38
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,880
got this public health emergency that

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,640
has exposed the fragility of our lives

40
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,640
it's shattered economies

41
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,479
we've got protests calling for a

42
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
reckoning over systemic

43
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,240
racial injustice and i think we need

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,560
connections now

45
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,880
both physical and digital that

46
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,280
strengthen our mutual bonds

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,039
remind us that our fates are united and

48
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,439
that our interdependence

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,799
is powerful and you know if you want

50
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,880
evidence just look around

51
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,640
because around the world this pandemic

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,079
has made internet access

53
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,320
move from nice to have to need to have

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,639
and in the united states an online

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,519
connection is now essential to maintain

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,080
some semblance of modern life as a

57
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
nation we moved online for education

58
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,920
for health care for commerce and so much

59
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
more

60
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,440
now i think it's incumbent on us to

61
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,399
figure out how to extend this

62
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,359
essential technology to a new decade and

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,599
eventually to a post pandemic era

64
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,560
so get ready because we have a lot of

65
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,760
work to do

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,440
on that front because we've learned

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,599
that while this formidable tool can

68
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:42,319
bring us together it can divide us too

69
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,319
we know we need to do more to combat

70
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,879
we just want to make sure i'm back

71
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,319
all right we know we need to do more to

72
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,359
combat misinformation

73
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,720
violent content and hate online and we

74
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,560
are still struggling

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,159
with a set of fundamental rights like

76
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,879
the right to free speech the right to

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,239
free press

78
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,840
the right to assembly and the right to

79
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,360
association and what they truly mean

80
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,319
online i know it's not easy but you see

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,080
i'm an optimist

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,518
i think gatherings like this even

83
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
virtually are places where we're going

84
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,360
to move that blueprint forward

85
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,040
where we're going to advance the idea

86
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,959
that we can connect more people

87
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,599
in more places around the world and we

88
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:22,640
can do so in a way that is safe

89
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
trustworthy and inclusive

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,720
of everyone who wants to participate

91
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,560
because human rights and democracy are

92
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,440
not just principles for the physical

93
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
world

94
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:33,120
they need meaning in the digital world

95
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,798
too and so today

96
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,120
in the united states we have an

97
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,120
opportunity to help do just that

98
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
and i think we should seize it and if

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,920
you're wondering what i mean by that

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,400
well then roll back with me

101
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,760
to may 28th of this year and i'm going

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:47,680
to explain

103
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,560
you see on may 28 the president of the

104
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,239
united states signed an executive order

105
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,599
and under this order and at his

106
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,680
direction

107
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,518
the national telecommunications and

108
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,280
information administration which is part

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,599
of the department of commerce

110
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,519
is filing a petition today at the

111
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,200
federal communications commission where

112
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,360
i work

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,079
and in this petition the administration

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,200
asks the fcc to come up with rules

115
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,400
moderating online content and we're told

116
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:17,199
to do so

117
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,959
using a law known as section 230 of the

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,680
communications decency act of 1996.

119
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,520
okay so how did we get here well let's

120
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,199
start with section 230.

121
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,599
it's a law that offers internet

122
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,320
companies protection from liability

123
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,240
for their content their users post

124
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:36,560
section 230 has been called the

125
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,639
26 words that created the internet and

126
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,120
it has helped free expression flourish

127
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,280
online for decades but like most things

128
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:45,600
with the internet it has its supporters

129
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,679
and its detractors it is those who want

130
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,440
to see it continue in its current form

131
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,280
and others who want to see it adjusted

132
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,560
to reflect the new realities of this

133
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,880
digital age

134
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,400
but if you look far and wide you really

135
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:59,600
aren't going to find a community that

136
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,159
believes having the fcc used section 230

137
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,120
to regulate speech online is the way to

138
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,479
go

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,400
now still the administration is

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,000
insisting because remember at the

141
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,400
highest level of our government we've

142
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,320
had rants about social media bias

143
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,638
and accusations that certain companies

144
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,680
are stifling speech

145
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,240
but here's the thing the first amendment

146
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,320
is not

147
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,280
present to protect the president from

148
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,599
media

149
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:25,039
it's present to protect media from the

150
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,199
president

151
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
nonetheless those rants eventually found

152
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,160
their home in an executive order and

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,320
that brought this issue to the fcc today

154
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,240
now as a commissioner i don't think the

155
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,039
fcc should take the bait

156
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,960
while social media can be frustrating

157
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:42,080
turning the fcc into the president's

158
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,479
speech police

159
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:45,120
is not the answer the fcc needs to

160
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,800
reject

161
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,560
this effort to deploy the federal

162
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,600
government against free expression

163
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,120
online

164
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,120
in fact i think if we want to honor the

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,960
constitution the agency needs to do so

166
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:57,039
immediately

167
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,479
now i worry my colleagues at the fcc

168
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,560
won't do that

169
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,479
i also worry that this petition is not

170
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,400
just about changing the law

171
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,318
because any legal expert worth their

172
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,198
salt will tell you that changing the law

173
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,280
like this

174
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
is not the job of a regulatory agency

175
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,359
like mine

176
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,800
it's the job of congress and i think our

177
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:16,639
colleagues at the ntia and the

178
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,479
administration know that

179
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:20,240
but even just proposing something like

180
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,840
this has consequences

181
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
because governments that threaten to

182
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
chill speech can discipline

183
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,080
private sector actors without changes in

184
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
law ever becoming necessary

185
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:32,479
so what we have here is this invitation

186
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,280
from the president for the fcc to help

187
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,039
chill online speech and organize it in

188
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,400
his favor

189
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,639
we need to reject it loud and clear

190
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,679
because you the way i see it in the

191
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:46,080
united states we

192
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,440
are a democratic open society in which

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,560
people can hold their government

194
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:52,000
accountable

195
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:54,160
even if imperfectly whether we can keep

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,880
it that way depends on the survival of a

197
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,000
robust

198
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,360
independent digital space for activism

199
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,800
and public discourse those spaces only

200
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,880
thrive if we say no

201
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,560
to the president's invitation to make

202
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,759
our networks less open

203
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,120
and more close to civic debate now i

204
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,440
think the american people

205
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,960
actually know right from wrong they know

206
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
free expression from government

207
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,919
censorship

208
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,960
and real change from baser rhetoric and

209
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,960
rants

210
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,159
i think when we get the facts organized

211
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,359
and mobilized we make

212
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,680
progress and progress right now

213
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,000
means surviving the crises of the moment

214
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,639
without sacrificing the values that have

215
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,919
made us successful in the past so we're

216
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:35,680
gonna have to roll up our sleeves

217
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,960
because we have work to do

218
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:41,120
because we want we not only want

219
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,359
the benefits of the digital age to reach

220
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,240
all we want those benefits to foster

221
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
human rights

222
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,879
and dignity for all and i think we can

223
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
start in the united states by saying no

224
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,240
to this petition that's been filed at

225
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,879
the fcc today

226
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
so with those is my opening remarks

227
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
thank you i hope we can get into some

228
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:59,520
conversation

229
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,520
in fact i'm looking forward to it

230
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:04,560
absolutely me too

231
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,878
um there are so many things that i want

232
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,319
to ask you and talk to you about um i

233
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,319
feel like i've been making a list in my

234
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
head for the past couple years

235
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,440
um but i've been making lists on paper

236
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,919
for the past couple days

237
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,199
and so i'm just going to dive right into

238
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,560
it um

239
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,319
first though i feel like i should

240
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,240
address um

241
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,520
everything happening in the background

242
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,319
and here which

243
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:27,840
is um that i'm on the road right now um

244
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,639
for anyone who doesn't know

245
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,799
i'm actually walking the colorado trail

246
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,880
which is a 486

247
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,079
mile trail from denver to durango

248
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:38,399
colorado

249
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
which is all on the ancestral homelands

250
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:43,039
of the southern ute nations

251
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,199
and um i'm doing it to actually raise

252
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,720
awareness about the digital divide in

253
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,480
indigenous communities

254
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,760
as well as just indigenous issues in

255
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,880
general um so

256
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,560
if anybody is interested in

257
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
seeing more about that or learning more

258
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,560
about that i am

259
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,120
i'm using instagram mostly as my

260
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,680
platform

261
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,880
which is my tag is at blackwater soul

262
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,880
and um so

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,320
it's not necessarily an apology but an

264
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,560
explanation of uh

265
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,440
of the trail clothes and the hotel room

266
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
so

267
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,800
this is where we are in a little

268
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:15,518
mountain town that uh i

269
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:17,920
found that the only place with fiber in

270
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,760
about a 200 mile radius i'm pretty sure

271
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:24,560
so uh so here we go um

272
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,839
you so you're today is a big day for

273
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,199
section 230

274
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,600
and um so at best obviously

275
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:32,640
what you said the 26 words that made the

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,600
internet is that

277
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:36,399
the same that's i hadn't heard that one

278
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,600
yes

279
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:41,920
sure um so at

280
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
best you know we're sit we're talking

281
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,439
about protection of

282
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,120
freedom of speech and and letting the

283
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,560
internet be what it is and what we

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,920
believe it to be so

285
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:55,040
um at worst we're protecting

286
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,760
um potential uh dark

287
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:59,360
corners of the internet um and i'm just

288
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,959
curious i i know that there is one

289
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,920
exception that they've made for

290
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:04,560
sex trafficking um and that kind of

291
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,199
holds

292
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,839
offers more accountability for any pages

293
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,519
that

294
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:12,959
may um that may you know promote that or

295
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,200
allow that to happen so

296
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,199
what i guess i'm just curious about your

297
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,760
idea if you could flesh out just kind of

298
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,800
what

299
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,519
what is the line and what in your mind

300
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,479
is the line of

301
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,000
accountability versus freedom and how we

302
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,079
hold people accountable

303
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,040
um and protect people while still

304
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,120
allowing

305
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
all the goodness that you're expressing

306
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,760
that is on the internet

307
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,640
now yeah that's a really good question

308
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:39,120
it's a big one

309
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,160
too i mean it goes at the heart of what

310
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:43,040
does speech mean

311
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,319
in the digital age how do we use this

312
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,160
technology

313
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,519
to give voice to communities that

314
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,000
haven't had the privilege of

315
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,200
broadcasting to large segments of the

316
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,519
public

317
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,079
but how do we also collectively decide

318
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,839
to constrain misinformation violence and

319
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,399
hate online

320
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:02,720
those are really hard issues and it is

321
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:05,600
imperative that we wrestle with them

322
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,000
but here's what's not right we can't

323
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
have

324
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,600
the president via executive order

325
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,880
telling the federal communications

326
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,760
commission to get

327
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:16,640
in the business of regulating content

328
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,040
online

329
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,079
and deciding what's okay to take down

330
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,800
and what's not okay to take down

331
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,079
and so i think that the direction test

332
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:29,199
in this executive order

333
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,519
is constitutionally fraught

334
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,800
we need to have congress take a look at

335
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,760
these issues

336
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,880
my regulatory agency has no business

337
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,439
being in the business

338
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,399
of articulating what's okay and what's

339
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,600
not okay

340
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:45,839
under section 230 online and furthermore

341
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,800
i think the tone of that executive order

342
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:49,440
gets some things

343
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,599
really backwards because in the end the

344
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,839
first amendment is there to protect

345
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,360
media from the president it's not there

346
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,639
to protect the president

347
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:01,440
from media i appreciate that

348
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,160
um especially because it seems like

349
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,279
you're

350
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,760
offering just sort of a

351
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,839
self-accountability

352
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,439
that maybe some people in an agency

353
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,800
would want to take up all of the air in

354
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,519
the room and all of the space that they

355
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,359
can

356
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:15,680
where what it sounds like you're saying

357
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,959
is this is this is a job for congress

358
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,920
this is not a job for

359
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,359
agency heads and um and if you didn't

360
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,120
think about it that way then maybe you

361
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,320
would think that that it was your job

362
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,720
and so um

363
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,839
it sounds like um the self-awareness

364
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:31,040
there is much

365
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,959
appreciated um so going

366
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,079
forward from that idea i want to talk a

367
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,880
little bit about

368
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:38,638
your remarks um at the state of the net

369
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:39,760
conference that you made in i think it

370
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,680
was january

371
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,519
in december it was like a long time ago

372
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,319
you know those yeah

373
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,040
right yes six years ago january this

374
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,760
year

375
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
um so you talked about internet

376
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,839
shutdowns

377
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:55,518
and that being a huge issue and the

378
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:57,920
example that you utilized was

379
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,200
the cashmere valley and the internet

380
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,120
shutdowns that

381
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,920
were happening there and how these are

382
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,880
really common actually around the world

383
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:08,560
especially around elections which um

384
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:13,120
sounds very strategic

385
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:15,599
and so i so going on in your remarks you

386
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,959
talk about 7-0 section 706 of the

387
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,079
communications act

388
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:22,399
where um essentially in the united

389
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,519
states this was a law that was made

390
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:25,920
after world war

391
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,560
ii that gave the president the power to

392
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,800
shut down

393
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,599
wired communications which at the time

394
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,880
that was made

395
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:36,240
meant what telegraphs and telephones um

396
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:39,600
and not the internet um and so there's

397
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:42,000
kind of this um idea there that that

398
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,519
law that this antiquated law could apply

399
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:46,560
to the internet today

400
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,120
so um obviously this might be another

401
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,000
call to congress to amend a law but

402
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:53,120
what are your other ideas about how we

403
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,160
can prevent

404
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:59,199
internet shutdowns in america um

405
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:00,160
and and to just you know would that ever

406
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,959
be a good thing

407
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:04,880
is there ever a scenario where that

408
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,079
would be something we need the power to

409
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,040
do

410
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,638
yeah more big questions you know one of

411
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,639
the things i started doing was looking

412
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,240
at internet shutdowns around the world

413
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:15,760
and i saw in the cashmere valley they

414
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:18,079
had done this

415
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:19,600
for seven months and it affected seven

416
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,040
million people

417
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:23,120
and then i started looking around the

418
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,199
rest of the world we had shutdowns in

419
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,959
refugee camps in bangladesh we had

420
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,120
shutdowns associated with elections in

421
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:30,479
the congo we had shutdowns associated

422
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,320
with

423
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
student exams in ethiopia

424
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:38,160
and what i learned is that these

425
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,880
internet shutdowns are becoming more

426
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:42,959
common worldwide that's a problem for

427
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,720
our interconnected economy but it's also

428
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:46,719
a problem for human rights

429
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:49,279
and i thought that could the united

430
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,519
states positively participate in this by

431
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:53,199
making that kind of assertion

432
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,959
and you know the first thing that i

433
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,079
thought i needed to do was probably

434
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,880
study our own

435
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:00,719
laws what rules did we have on the books

436
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,360
and what struck me most was what you

437
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,760
said

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:07,040
i found that old section 706 in the

439
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:10,079
communications act of 1934

440
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,599
suggests that the president alone has

441
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:14,479
the authority to shut down

442
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:16,399
wired and wireless networks and the way

443
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,040
the law is written it gives reasons like

444
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:19,199
war

445
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,639
threat of war public emergency or

446
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,599
disaster

447
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:24,720
but in the end those are radically vague

448
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,320
terms

449
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,839
which means that a president could

450
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,040
simply ask

451
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,800
his or her attorney general to describe

452
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,680
whether or not those preconditions had

453
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
been met

454
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,839
and then turn around and try to shut off

455
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,120
wired or wireless networks

456
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,959
and i thought well that's my

457
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,720
interpretation is it really outlandish

458
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,399
and i started studying and i found that

459
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,160
in 2010

460
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,759
the senate in the united states produced

461
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:50,160
a report acknowledging

462
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,880
that this right existed in the law and

463
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,839
when i

464
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,160
stated the world and the state of this

465
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:57,120
country

466
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
what occurs to me is that this law that

467
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,839
was last

468
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,800
updated after pearl harbor when

469
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:04,320
telegrams meant communications

470
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,319
needs an update we need to have

471
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,920
accountability from congress

472
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:10,399
and the judicial branch we need to

473
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:12,000
understand why in an emergency the

474
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
president has this authority

475
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:15,920
and what are the reasonable constraints

476
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,480
we put on it because we live life

477
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:20,079
online that connectivity is powerful

478
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,839
it's democratizing

479
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,160
and finding out that one individual has

480
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,839
a unilateral right to shut it off

481
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,120
left me disturbed so i gave a speech

482
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,440
about it as you said in the state of the

483
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,279
net

484
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,040
i also wrote a shorter editorial about

485
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,720
it in the washington post

486
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,920
and um i continue to believe it's

487
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,720
something that congress should take a

488
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,639
look at

489
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,920
because the scope of the president's

490
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,079
authority in this regard

491
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:41,370
is actually unbounded because the law is

492
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,719
so old

493
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:45,680
[Music]

494
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,560
yeah um so there's a couple things you

495
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:49,279
said there that

496
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,199
um kind of lead me to my next point and

497
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:53,519
i guess broadly

498
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,599
though the we in we live our lives

499
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,639
online are the people who have the

500
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,680
privilege

501
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,639
of being connected and so um

502
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:05,198
kind of switching gears to to my playing

503
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,120
field of um indigenous communities

504
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,880
and especially rural indigenous

505
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:12,000
communities um there's

506
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:15,439
a couple different stats out um

507
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:16,079
floating around i saw your op-ed in the

508
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
hill

509
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,119
that you co-wrote with your uh senator

510
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,880
kirsten cinema

511
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,479
about the tribal priority window which

512
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:26,400
is definitely something that i want to

513
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:30,480
swing back around to but um you know

514
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,160
as far as internet shutdowns go in

515
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:34,320
this may sound to come across kind of

516
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:37,039
backwards but um

517
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,200
it's sort of a luxury to worry about

518
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,120
your internet being shut down because

519
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,679
there are so many people

520
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:45,678
who don't have internet in the first

521
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,080
place who don't have internet access at

522
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,000
home

523
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,360
or anywhere near them many of those

524
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,640
people living on

525
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,159
in rural tribal areas rural tribal lands

526
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,280
um the stat that uh i've heard a lot is

527
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:00,640
seven out of ten

528
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,440
homes on rural tribal areas don't have

529
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,520
any internet

530
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,200
access whatsoever and i know that you're

531
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,879
well aware of this because not only do

532
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,520
we have the term the digital divide we

533
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,760
also have the

534
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,639
term the homework gap which is something

535
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,400
that you coined

536
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:17,919
which i really like because it gets to

537
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,799
um it gets to really the the meat of the

538
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:20,480
issue that

539
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,720
that it's not that kids can't go to

540
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:24,559
school and use um their school

541
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
you know like my i'm from monument

542
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:28,399
valley uh that's where my family is from

543
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,600
monument valley utah on the navajo

544
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
nation

545
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:34,000
and um they have good internet at the

546
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,039
school and you often see cars parked in

547
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,400
the parking lot

548
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,320
to use that but that doesn't get to

549
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,080
the homework gap which is what you're

550
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,280
seeing and that's really where a lot of

551
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,240
the issue is

552
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,320
so you've been outspoken about utilizing

553
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,440
the e-rate programs and the lifeline

554
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
programs to help bridge this gap this

555
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,000
divide

556
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,840
um can you just kind of flesh that out

557
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,640
for us of what that looks like what your

558
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,760
ideas are

559
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:02,000
and and how we can move them forward

560
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,520
yeah you know um in making the

561
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,559
connection i actually think internet

562
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,559
shutdowns

563
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:07,840
are related because if we say that you

564
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,799
can't shut it down

565
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:12,559
we're saying it's essential and if it's

566
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,200
essential we've got to figure out how to

567
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,200
get it to

568
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,880
everyone so i feel like these are

569
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:19,280
actually part of the same

570
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,160
principled argument which is everyone

571
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,918
needs access

572
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:23,679
if you don't have it you don't have a

573
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,039
fair shot at success

574
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:27,200
and as you mentioned on some of our

575
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,720
tribal lands these are some of the areas

576
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,919
in the country that have the lowest

577
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,280
levels

578
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:34,720
of deployment and adoption and you also

579
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,399
mentioned students and this is

580
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,559
particularly hits home for me i mean

581
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:40,240
look um when i was growing up

582
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,760
i didn't need the internet to do my

583
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:44,080
homework i needed paper

584
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,559
a pencil and my brother leaving me alone

585
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,960
right it was like not more complicated

586
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,720
but today you know seven and ten

587
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,600
teachers assign homework that requires

588
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,919
internet access but you just mentioned

589
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,039
tribal areas where seven out of ten

590
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,280
homes don't have it

591
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,160
those kids fall into this homework gap

592
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,080
where they can't do

593
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:03,600
nightly school work and now we have this

594
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:05,520
pandemic we sent

595
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,520
millions of kids home and said go to

596
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:10,320
class online

597
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,600
but we've got as many as 17 million kids

598
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:13,120
locked out of the virtual

599
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,760
classroom because they fall into the

600
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:17,360
homework gap so we've got a big digital

601
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:18,640
divide problem as you know because

602
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,080
you're hiking across the state of

603
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,120
colorado to draw attention

604
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,840
to it and here's the thing

605
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:27,280
it is hard to solve we've got to decide

606
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,559
we're going to do it just as we did

607
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,440
audacious things before

608
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,760
bringing plumbing and electricity to the

609
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,159
far

610
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,799
corners of this country but i think the

611
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,559
place we

612
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:41,039
start right now is say every child

613
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:42,879
should have an internet connection

614
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:44,158
because if we get an internet connection

615
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,640
to every kid that can

616
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,320
go to school during this crisis and they

617
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
can do their homework when we reach the

618
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,720
other side

619
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:52,320
and for some kids that'll be a

620
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,039
connection in their homes for others it

621
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:56,480
will be

622
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,000
a wireless hotspot but we need to make

623
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:01,200
solving the homework gap

624
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,840
a national priority it affects

625
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,760
rural america it affects urban america

626
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,120
we should come together and solve it to

627
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,679
me that's the cruelest part of the

628
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:12,000
digital divide and the one we need to be

629
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:14,640
working on right now so when we turn

630
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,159
around and school starts again

631
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,640
we don't find that there are kids that

632
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:21,679
are cut off

633
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:23,679
sure so in rural

634
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:26,000
it's it's interesting because there's a

635
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,120
lot of overlap between rural america

636
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,480
and tribal america as far as this lack

637
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,320
of connection and

638
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,400
and this this issue of the digital

639
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,760
divide and the homework gap

640
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:41,280
but the thing about tribal america

641
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
is that there is a trust responsibility

642
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,240
that the united states

643
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,640
has two tribes um and

644
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,400
this is this is a very important

645
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,440
responsibility that should be taken very

646
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,760
seriously

647
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:56,799
even though we've seen it not taken

648
00:21:55,760 --> 00:22:00,158
seriously by

649
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:02,480
many administrations and many many

650
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:03,760
agencies in lots of different decisions

651
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:07,120
over the

652
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,559
centuries so i'm curious

653
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,280
how this trust responsibility one

654
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:15,039
how it manifests in your job and just

655
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
really in your mind as you're thinking

656
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,120
about connecting

657
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,240
uh maybe rural lands versus tribal lands

658
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:25,360
when there are limited resources um and

659
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,640
two just how that really changes the

660
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,120
equation

661
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,000
when we're thinking about connecting

662
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:34,000
what we might call

663
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:35,919
indian country well we do know

664
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,600
based on available data that tribal

665
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:39,919
lands are among

666
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,439
the least connected places in this

667
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:44,559
country

668
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:47,520
and we have a special responsibility

669
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,639
with um we have a federal trust

670
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,918
responsibility

671
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,400
that the fcc memorialized back in 2000

672
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:57,280
20 years ago in a policy statement about

673
00:22:55,400 --> 00:23:00,960
government-to-government relations

674
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:04,000
and how we would navigate the um

675
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,760
legal issues but also issues of respect

676
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,240
associated with assisting with

677
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:10,000
deployment on those lands

678
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,919
and i have to say that 20 years is a

679
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,760
long time it's kind of like a contract

680
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:17,120
that needs renewal

681
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:20,400
um i uh i think it's worth

682
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:22,399
the time effort and energy at the fcc

683
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,919
and other agencies that interact with

684
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,880
tribal communities

685
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:27,679
and essential facilities like this to

686
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,159
actually

687
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,760
restate those policy statements recommit

688
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,520
to them because it will force us to come

689
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:35,039
up with fresh ideas

690
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:37,679
about how to address the lack of

691
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,320
connectivity but i also think when we do

692
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:39,760
that

693
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,520
one of the things that gets to me is we

694
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:43,520
always sit around and decry the lack of

695
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:46,000
connectivity it's important to do that

696
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,760
but it's just as important to

697
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,880
demonstrate the places where things are

698
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,120
working

699
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:52,400
because you have to show people that

700
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,320
there are some examples

701
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,320
um there are wonderful examples in new

702
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:57,200
mexico for instance i visited a tribal

703
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,279
library with

704
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,799
congressman ben ray lujan and we even

705
00:23:59,279 --> 00:24:03,279
wrote about this library that the san

706
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,240
felipe pueblo had first connected to the

707
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,559
internet

708
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,320
and how it changed the life of students

709
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:10,240
and teachers in the community

710
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,480
and the library built this big porch out

711
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,880
front because there were so many people

712
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,840
coming to it to use it and it changed

713
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:18,080
the community

714
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:19,918
and they used fcc e-rate money to help

715
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,399
do that on their own

716
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:23,919
and i think that example is so powerful

717
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,960
because it shows that the good things

718
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,200
can be done

719
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:29,279
and likewise we have the havasupi tribe

720
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:31,600
in arizona

721
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:33,279
which is the only one living below the

722
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,959
rim of the grand canyon so it's just

723
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,080
like absolutely gorgeous but you know

724
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,080
one of those things is like

725
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:40,559
the more beautiful the land you're on

726
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:42,639
the less likely it's actually

727
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,279
wired because it's probably hard to do

728
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,000
so but that truck came to the fcc and

729
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,760
sought a special

730
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,520
temporary authority to get access to

731
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,879
spectrum that was actually in the 2.5

732
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:53,279
gigahertz band

733
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,960
and they set up a system where they got

734
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:55,840
folks wirelessly connected in their

735
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:58,000
community

736
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,000
by putting facilities in teachers and

737
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,880
students homes

738
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,080
and um i think every time we sit around

739
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:07,039
and we talk

740
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,720
about uh challenges on tribal lands we

741
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,600
have to also point to the things that

742
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,200
are working

743
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:13,120
because when you see examples of that

744
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,640
kind of self-determination

745
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,639
i think you can multiply them i think

746
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:19,200
they can replicate and i think we can

747
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:22,080
grow connectivity as a result

748
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,440
yeah i absolutely love those examples

749
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:25,360
and i'm so glad

750
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,720
that you brought them up because yes

751
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,719
they are absolutely

752
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,760
so worthy of recognition especially the

753
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:32,320
people who did

754
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:33,840
such hard work to make those happen um

755
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,639
both on the policy end

756
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:38,240
and on the physically you know i i had

757
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:41,360
the honor of going to

758
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:42,400
um hawaii last november with the

759
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,240
internet society

760
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,640
and a another organization called mural

761
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,120
nonprofit and we helped set up their

762
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,360
sovereign community networks and so

763
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,959
i got to see the policy side in law

764
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:56,399
school but i also got to see

765
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,799
you know i also got to tighten the

766
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:02,080
wrenches on uh the base stations

767
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,679
that were you know yeah showing these uh

768
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:06,320
spreading the internet to this community

769
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:08,159
and so um there's so much hard work and

770
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:11,200
so many people working so hard

771
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:13,600
to bridge this divide um

772
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:15,600
and i think a lot of them would say that

773
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:18,080
uh you know they love what they do

774
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,879
and that they are happy to be doing that

775
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,320
work

776
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:24,640
and that they need the resources enabled

777
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:26,000
to be able to complete the work that

778
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:28,640
they're trying to do

779
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,000
so one of the things that i have written

780
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:32,640
extensively about both

781
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,520
in law school and in different office is

782
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,600
about

783
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,879
this idea of spectrum sovereignty is

784
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,158
what i call a tribal spectrum

785
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,799
sovereignty and

786
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,120
um for anyone who's not familiar with

787
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:46,000
kind of this term of tribal sovereignty

788
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,158
um it's that right now as it sits there

789
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,880
are 574

790
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,799
federally recognized tribes within

791
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,400
america and so these are native nations

792
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,000
that have been here since what we say

793
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:58,640
time immemorial

794
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,480
and that means that they have been

795
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,919
nations on this land since before the

796
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:05,200
united states ever

797
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,400
you know was conceived of by found the

798
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,480
founding fathers

799
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:14,000
and mothers so um these native nations

800
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,880
are sovereigns and they retain their

801
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,039
resources

802
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,720
um this can be you know i've been hiking

803
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,559
through watching the timber trucks come

804
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,159
down watching the mines

805
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,918
these open mines that you know we've

806
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,000
been hiking by that they're pulling

807
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,120
they've pulled silver and copper and

808
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,640
uranium out of

809
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:32,719
for um hundreds and hundreds of years um

810
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,200
as well as water and coal and oil and

811
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:37,760
gas um so in my view

812
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,720
um spectrum is one of these natural

813
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,879
resources

814
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,559
because it has also been on the land

815
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:44,320
since time immemorial

816
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,480
um i understand that that's not the view

817
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,439
of the fcc or the us government and

818
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:51,039
that's okay

819
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:54,559
um but i am curious about um

820
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:57,360
just what your plans are to help

821
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:59,279
connect tribes with spectrum which is

822
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,559
this necessary resource when we're

823
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,360
talking about

824
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,320
um creating these networks on tribal

825
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:07,520
lands you need

826
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,158
they need spectrum and um again going

827
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,279
back to your

828
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,799
op-ed in the hill with senator cinema um

829
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:18,159
you have suggested that tribes need

830
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:21,200
more time to apply for

831
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,399
these spectrum licenses and so i'm just

832
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,760
curious

833
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,080
i guess i'm looking for a bit of an

834
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,600
insider's view and a bit of advice for

835
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:30,000
tribal leaders

836
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:31,120
who also need more who are the ones who

837
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,480
need that time

838
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,158
um to apply for the spectrum licenses

839
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,880
that are so important that will help

840
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,840
them connect

841
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,240
their people their students and really

842
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,240
um

843
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,159
fill out their the room for

844
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,440
self-determination and sovereignty

845
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:50,240
so um what is your advice to them

846
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:52,080
um and what can we do to get more

847
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:54,240
spectrum to get more time to

848
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,678
apply for spectrum uh what it what are

849
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:58,000
your thoughts

850
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:59,279
well let's start by talking about let's

851
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,440
be like full-on

852
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,880
um female spectrum nerds and talk about

853
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:07,360
the 2.5

854
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:10,720
gigahertz fan it is the sweet spot

855
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:14,719
for current and next-generation wireless

856
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:17,279
here's why it has lots of capacity and

857
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:19,760
it propagates far

858
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:22,080
it is the kind of stuff that a lot of

859
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:26,158
our commercial companies want to build

860
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,639
5g infrastructure on and so the fcc has

861
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,799
a

862
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,919
once in a lifetime opportunity for

863
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:33,760
tribes that's happening right now

864
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:35,520
we're like the havasupi tribe we just

865
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:37,919
talked about they can come

866
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,440
and claim a license in that band over

867
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,520
tribal lands

868
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:46,880
or rural alaskan communities and also

869
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,480
uh hawaiian homelands and

870
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,240
um that's an extraordinary opportunity

871
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:55,520
that's the type of opportunity

872
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:56,880
that needs to be seized but when i

873
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,760
started looking

874
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,159
at the data we have about this window

875
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:05,039
for tribes claiming access to it

876
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,320
what i found was only about 15 of the

877
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,240
eligible tribes had actually done so

878
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,520
and you know it occurred to me that our

879
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,360
window for claiming

880
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:18,639
access to this spectrum was pretty much

881
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,719
during the time of the corona virus

882
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:22,640
and something that struck me as the fcc

883
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:24,080
has changed lots of deadlines for

884
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,120
companies

885
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:29,600
during this crisis the fcc extended

886
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:31,760
a spectrum auction in the 3.5 gigahertz

887
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,600
band during this crisis

888
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:35,919
we even let a company that's been

889
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
identified as a national security threat

890
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,840
extend the time for its comments in a

891
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:42,480
proceeding in this crisis

892
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:45,439
so with senator cinema we said something

893
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,520
that strikes me as painfully obvious

894
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,000
let's extend time for tribes to get

895
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:53,360
access to the 2.5 gigahertz band during

896
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,200
this crisis and you know i don't think

897
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
of that as something that's especially

898
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:59,120
partisan that

899
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:01,039
idea has gotten support from senator

900
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,000
sullivan in alaska senator

901
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:05,360
warren in massachusetts and i wrote with

902
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,200
senator cinema

903
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,519
real cross-section of the public in our

904
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:11,679
politics but the idea that we want to

905
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,880
see tribes have access to airwaves

906
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,640
and do neat things with it is embodied

907
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:19,279
in that opportunity

908
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,240
so why don't we extend the deadline

909
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,960
because

910
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,640
as you probably know a lot of tribal

911
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:26,000
communities are struggling with this

912
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:27,760
virus right now

913
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,159
and to tell them when they're thinking

914
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:31,919
about basic survival

915
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,600
well go get your engineering studies

916
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,200
ready start mapping out where you put

917
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:37,039
towers start figuring out

918
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:38,320
how you'd actually get capital make this

919
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,240
happen

920
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:41,918
i think we need to do them the courtesy

921
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,600
of extending a deadline we've done it

922
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,399
for so many others who come before the

923
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,320
fcc

924
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
let's do it for tribes let's figure out

925
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,279
how more of them can access these kind

926
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:51,439
of opportunities

927
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:53,279
by changing that deadline right now the

928
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,440
deadline is august 3rd

929
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:57,519
and um if you care about this issue

930
00:31:55,440 --> 00:32:00,480
please let my colleagues at the fcc know

931
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:02,080
uh i am um relentless on this point and

932
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,760
i'll be loud and noisy but i'm gonna

933
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,039
need their votes to make it happen

934
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:07,360
and i think it's important that we

935
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:09,200
extend this deadline and do just that

936
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,879
i completely agree with you and i'm i'm

937
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,080
just curious exactly

938
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:16,159
because we have i have um you know on

939
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,918
my social media platforms so many

940
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:20,240
supporters and so many people who are

941
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:21,440
are always asking how can i help how can

942
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:24,880
i help um and

943
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:28,240
i feel like this is a very um a very

944
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:30,720
real way that people can mobilize to

945
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:32,960
um a very real answer to that question

946
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,480
so what exactly does that look like does

947
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,159
that look like sending an email

948
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:38,000
what does that look like is there like

949
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:41,039
an online forum

950
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,919
oh all of it i believe you make a ruckus

951
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:45,840
to get things done let myself and my

952
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:48,320
colleagues at the fcc know let your

953
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,600
elected representatives know

954
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:54,559
i am i think noise is still powerful

955
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:56,719
so um make it because the opportunities

956
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:57,760
in the 2.5 gigahertz span for tribal

957
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:00,399
communities

958
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,158
are extraordinary we have to make sure

959
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,439
that during this crisis they don't miss

960
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,720
them and they get the opportunity to

961
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,919
seize it

962
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:11,360
okay so um i think what i will do

963
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,640
um is that i will

964
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:15,439
put a post on my social media um my

965
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,519
instagram and my

966
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:18,720
twitter um with some of the language

967
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,279
because there's a lot of

968
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,240
you know spectrum airwaves and a lot of

969
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:24,240
just kind of

970
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,360
confusing terms that we can nerd out on

971
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,279
all day but uh

972
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,360
for someone who hasn't studied this

973
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:31,679
extensively is a little bit overwhelming

974
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,519
so um again you can find me at

975
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:36,159
blackwatersoul on twitter or

976
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:37,600
instagram and i will post some language

977
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:40,000
um if that's something that

978
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,760
our listeners are interested in um

979
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,960
mobilizing around because that would be

980
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:45,840
a very very

981
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,919
worthy and much needed cause um and

982
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:50,158
something very real that people can do

983
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:51,600
in order to help this and so

984
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,200
specifically what we're saying

985
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:58,399
is that um the fcc is giving

986
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,960
tribes these 574 native nations

987
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:02,158
sovereign nations the opportunity to

988
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,640
apply for this

989
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:06,240
really important and very useful

990
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,280
spectrum that we can

991
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:12,159
use to build networks on and

992
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,079
but internet access so kids can do their

993
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,200
homework so tribes can build their own

994
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,679
businesses

995
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,399
so that self-determination is really

996
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:19,839
viable

997
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,000
and connectivity grows in the

998
00:34:19,839 --> 00:34:25,279
communities that are least connected

999
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,359
exactly um and but there's a deadline

1000
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:29,520
and tribes a lot of native nations

1001
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:32,399
haven't been able to get their

1002
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:33,199
applications in because they have been

1003
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,560
closed

1004
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,239
a lot of the governments have been

1005
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,399
closed um our elders

1006
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:39,678
aren't meeting our tribal councils

1007
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:42,799
aren't meeting because

1008
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,879
of this pandemic and that and because

1009
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,359
they're not connected they can't do it

1010
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,199
virtually like we are right now um and

1011
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:51,598
so we really need a longer

1012
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,480
window for tribes to get this

1013
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,119
application

1014
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
in so that they can meet so that they

1015
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:00,079
can do their government processes

1016
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,200
um in order to get an application into

1017
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:03,359
the fcc

1018
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,640
in order to get the spectrum that will

1019
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:06,160
allow them to

1020
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:07,440
set up networks and connect their

1021
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:08,799
students and their entrepreneurs and

1022
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,839
their artists and

1023
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:12,720
and this really gets to um just one of

1024
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,040
the points that

1025
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:16,078
i i think about so often and as i've

1026
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,839
been walking

1027
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:20,320
days and hours and weeks i've been

1028
00:35:17,839 --> 00:35:23,599
thinking about this idea that

1029
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:26,640
um it's not just that indigenous

1030
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,640
people need the internet i truly believe

1031
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,598
that the internet meets indigenous

1032
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,680
people because these indigenous ideas

1033
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:34,720
that so many people are coming back to

1034
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,200
whether it be

1035
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,040
um you know indigenous burn practices

1036
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:40,480
that are protecting our woods

1037
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:42,079
or whether it be indigenous food

1038
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,599
sovereignty um

1039
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:46,079
coming back to these foods that really

1040
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:47,440
nourish us or even these indigenous

1041
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:50,720
ideas around healing

1042
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:53,839
and and you know ceremony and and every

1043
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,359
the whole in navajo we call it which is

1044
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,000
just kind of like living your life in

1045
00:35:55,359 --> 00:35:58,960
balance

1046
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:00,560
in a way that um is walking in beauty is

1047
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
what it means um

1048
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,680
people need these ideas now more than

1049
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,800
ever

1050
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
and there are so many indigenous people

1051
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:10,320
right now

1052
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,240
who are doing such amazing art and

1053
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:14,480
making such beautiful beautiful

1054
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,759
things and who are just putting such

1055
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,040
beautiful words into the world

1056
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:21,280
and ideas and and sharing and if they're

1057
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,800
not connected it means that the world is

1058
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,119
also deprived from

1059
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:27,359
them and their beauty and you know we've

1060
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:28,000
seen we've seen how interested the world

1061
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,759
is in

1062
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,680
indigenous ideas because they

1063
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,760
appropriate it all the time

1064
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,759
um but there's so much authenticity and

1065
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,720
genuinity that is that the world needs

1066
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,800
to see as well

1067
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:40,319
um i think that's really that's really

1068
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,400
beautifully put and i think it's

1069
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,200
actually true worldwide we talk about

1070
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,960
how

1071
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,520
difficult it is in the united states to

1072
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,760
connect people who aren't connected

1073
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:50,640
we don't frame the conversation as a

1074
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,079
discussion of

1075
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:55,279
economic loss what do we as a whole lose

1076
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:58,000
when we do not connect

1077
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:59,200
everyone you know for a moment in

1078
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,040
washington dc

1079
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,960
one-third of the kids live in households

1080
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:04,480
or 30 of the kids live in households

1081
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,839
who don't have internet connections in

1082
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,640
detroit it might be as high as 60

1083
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:10,240
percent and

1084
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,160
think about those households those

1085
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,680
students their creativity their power to

1086
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,640
contribute to their community their

1087
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,319
economy

1088
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,118
to grow things that we need

1089
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:22,800
not connecting them is economic loss

1090
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,320
it's not that it's expensive it's also

1091
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,359
economic loss so i think what you

1092
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,520
described

1093
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,720
actually is a something that we have to

1094
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,839
frame

1095
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:32,720
um internet access within broadband

1096
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:34,480
connections

1097
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
more broadly nationwide it's like how we

1098
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,720
have to think about it about what we're

1099
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,799
losing by not connecting everyone

1100
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,598
yeah yeah i completely agree um

1101
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,000
so we've pretty much made it through my

1102
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:48,560
list

1103
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,040
which i i'm very excited about um i

1104
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:53,839
think we have about five minutes left

1105
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,119
um really the last thing that i would

1106
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:58,720
like to

1107
00:37:55,119 --> 00:38:00,720
swing back around to um is

1108
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:02,640
this idea that we already touched on of

1109
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,200
the trust responsibility

1110
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,359
and um you know having this opportunity

1111
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:08,160
to speak to you especially publicly i

1112
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,480
would be remiss

1113
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,279
if i didn't really just drive the point

1114
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,599
home that

1115
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,000
um this is something that native nations

1116
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:18,800
take so very seriously and it's

1117
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,359
something that we have been disappointed

1118
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,920
by the united states over and over again

1119
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,119
and

1120
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,320
so i have asked um

1121
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,800
other people in the fcc what their take

1122
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,400
is or

1123
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,560
or how they trust what their trust

1124
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,119
responsibility means to them

1125
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,520
and i've been disappointed because

1126
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:39,839
sometimes the answer that i get

1127
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:41,200
is kind of like well it means being nice

1128
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:44,240
to tribes

1129
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:46,240
and as i'm sure you know the trust

1130
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:48,560
responsibility means so

1131
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,759
much more than that and it really is a

1132
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,799
government take a government

1133
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,320
relationship

1134
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,800
and um so i guess i'm interested

1135
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:58,079
one i would just like to encourage you

1136
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,160
so much to

1137
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:02,000
you know visit native nations i'm sure

1138
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,640
you have already but just to visit the

1139
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:05,359
more

1140
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,759
and just to understand the beauty of

1141
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:08,560
them

1142
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:10,079
um and the importance of protecting that

1143
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,160
and allowing that to flourish

1144
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:13,440
um these different cultures but but two

1145
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,520
i'm also interested

1146
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,880
in and i'm going to put a little bit of

1147
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:21,119
pressure on you here um

1148
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:24,240
of just how

1149
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,800
how you can utilize your position

1150
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,078
and um you know really speak to your

1151
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,359
colleagues and and

1152
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,320
be a leader and set the culture of

1153
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:35,040
making that

1154
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:36,640
important within the agency that you are

1155
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,800
one of the heads of

1156
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:42,160
and um so i'm just i guess it's not even

1157
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,400
really a question it's more of a

1158
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:45,440
statement but i just hope that you can

1159
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,880
really take that to heart

1160
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,800
moving forward even more than you

1161
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,079
already do

1162
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,280
okay i've got homework i understand

1163
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:56,079
i would like to see the agency recommit

1164
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,839
to that policy

1165
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,920
statement i think it would force a

1166
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,400
reckoning with how we've fallen short

1167
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,040
in recent years and i think it's

1168
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,280
important to publicly do that

1169
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,400
i'd also like us to see how we can make

1170
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:13,040
our native nations task force um

1171
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,520
integrate them more into our work you

1172
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,680
know

1173
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,119
not just have them on the margins but

1174
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:18,879
figure out for instance when we're

1175
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:21,920
mapping where broadband is and

1176
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,400
is not why don't we ask them to take

1177
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:26,880
those maps back to their communities

1178
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:28,480
help us validate because you know what i

1179
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,319
think their lived experience is

1180
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:31,599
extraordinarily valuable

1181
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,759
and we should figure out how to

1182
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,040
incorporate it into the data gathering

1183
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
and work we do

1184
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:38,640
so i'd like to find more real world ways

1185
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,920
to integrate

1186
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,000
and that's just one of them that i've

1187
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,359
been thinking about but also um like i

1188
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,040
said before updating the policy

1189
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:46,720
statement

1190
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:48,480
yeah thank you i would love to see that

1191
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:50,560
as well um

1192
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:52,400
is there anything that i haven't asked

1193
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:54,240
you about or that we haven't touched on

1194
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,960
that uh you would like to

1195
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,078
you know tell i i have no idea how many

1196
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,920
people are watching

1197
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,760
it it could just be you and me and my

1198
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,680
mom right i have no idea

1199
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:05,359
but um is there anything that you would

1200
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:09,200
uh you know would like to

1201
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,680
share um just that uh

1202
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:12,799
look these are complicated days for

1203
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:16,078
internet access

1204
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,200
and it can bring us together it can push

1205
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:19,280
us apart

1206
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:21,040
but i remain convinced that the future

1207
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,000
belongs to the connected we've got to

1208
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:24,000
figure out

1209
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,280
how to connect everyone in this country

1210
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:27,520
and this world

1211
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:28,880
and then compel ourselves to use those

1212
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,200
connections

1213
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,359
to do good things for the public and for

1214
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:37,200
human rights and i still as an optimist

1215
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,920
i'm impatient but i think it's possible

1216
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,480
yeah i completely agree with you well i

1217
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:42,960
think we

1218
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,240
