14

joining me today it's true this is my

15
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
last day a special rapper tour

and i'm super excited to talk about it

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
and to talk about

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,679
the work that you've done and the

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,599
pressures you've faced over the last

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,200
several years as well it's been

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,760
really an honor to work with you over

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,079
these many years

23
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,200
i was just thinking 2014 which was when

24
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,400
you took this

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,200
post i mean this is the year when

26
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,760
everything turned it began this turn

27
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,679
upside down you know when we moved from

28
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,840
uh censorship to scarcity to abundance

29
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,760
and one of the things i've loved while

30
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:36,480
watching you and then working with you

31
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,319
is

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,359
how somehow you you were so agile

33
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,599
you always not just dealt with the

34
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,400
problems that were there in the moment

35
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:50,238
but you were always at the forefront of

36
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,200
trump of understanding what was going to

37
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,519
happen next

38
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,280
how did you do this at this time of

39
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,280
amazing of drastic change

40
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,519
yeah i mean first of all that's very

41
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,839
nice of you to say

42
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,200
i i guess i never necessarily felt that

43
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,519
i was

44
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,799
at the forefront or in the vanguard of

45
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:12,319
anything in particular

46
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,720
and i think that's because the work of

47
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,599
of being a special rapporteur is very

48
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,000
much

49
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,959
a group effort and from the very

50
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,040
beginning

51
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,120
i was able to work with with civil

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:27,280
society organizations

53
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,840
with individuals with experts who were

54
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
themselves very much at the forefront

55
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,840
and these were people around the world

56
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,879
you know some of them were with major

57
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,480
international

58
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,239
uh ngos like article 19

59
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,959
um or access now uh whom i met with

60
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,000
very early in in my mandate and they

61
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
were able to say

62
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,040
to me look these are the issues that we

63
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,080
see

64
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,120
not just today that are

65
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,920
having an impact on digital rights

66
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,799
on access to information on the media on

67
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
journalists

68
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,159
but this is where we think it's heading

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:05,040
over the next several years

70
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:06,399
and so you know part of the part of my

71
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,560
effort

72
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,840
was really to learn from the people

73
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,560
who've been studying these

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,280
issues for many years to to bring them

75
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,720
to the fore to make them issues not only

76
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,120
for our traditional stakeholders that is

77
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,079
let's say governments you know those who

78
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
have the

79
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:26,320
the biggest and potentially most

80
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,440
problematic impact on freedom of

81
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,479
expression

82
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,199
but also on on companies and

83
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,880
you know those private actors who have

84
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,240
an increasing

85
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:40,320
impact on on access to information

86
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,000
on the flow of information on freedom of

87
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,560
expression so having that

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,160
exchange with with individuals with

89
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,080
experts with organizations was

90
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,280
always key to to my work to enabling me

91
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,680
i mean to the extent it seems that way

92
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,960
enabling me to stay on top of the issues

93
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,040
and maybe stay a little bit ahead of

94
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,638
them

95
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,199
i i think you definitely did that

96
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,120
because your mandate also not only

97
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,240
you know you kept track of both the

98
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,120
physical world

99
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,320
and the online and offline and that's

100
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:13,199
you know from

101
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
the traditional the people who had power

102
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,840
tended to be

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:19,919
older and tended to ignore for a long

104
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,280
time what was happening online and i

105
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,639
think this is one of the strengths of

106
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,000
the time that you were there

107
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,680
i mean you i guess the question is

108
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,919
you've seen the trends you've seen the

109
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,800
patterns uh

110
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,400
well while you were doing this what

111
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:39,039
worried you the most

112
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,080
what kept you up at night

113
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,400
yeah i you know so the

114
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,960
the issue for for this particular

115
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:50,080
mandate freedom of expression

116
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,919
is that in so many respects

117
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,479
it is everything it's exactly what you

118
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:57,120
said it's the physical space

119
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:58,159
and it's the digital space i mean one of

120
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,199
the things that

121
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,280
that i think became clearer to me over

122
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,759
time but wasn't necessarily

123
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:10,080
wasn't necessarily as clear in let's say

124
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,120
2014 at least to me was

125
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,680
the deep connection between the

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
online and the offline and that you know

127
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,800
that goes to all sorts of issues

128
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,000
that goes to the way in which online

129
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,800
space

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
is is a kind of forum for harassment

131
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,400
which

132
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,960
i would say that early on in the

133
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,039
development of the online world

134
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,000
that that harassment was seen as you

135
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,520
know look that's just

136
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,160
online um that is just you know people

137
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:42,479
exercising some kind of robust

138
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,360
freedom of expression but i think you

139
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,479
know as as long ago as you know at least

140
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,319
10 15 years ago people people did

141
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,680
understand

142
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:57,039
that harassment online wasn't really

143
00:06:53,680 --> 00:07:00,160
a a kind of exercise

144
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,199
of freedom of expression that was

145
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,000
without

146
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,800
impact and i think over the last several

147
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,080
years

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,080
um i mean i've certainly seen the way in

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:13,198
which harassment

150
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,080
just to give one example harassment

151
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,919
online such as the kind of trolling that

152
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,719
you've received for many years that

153
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:20,479
you've been on

154
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,800
you know you've been subjected to in the

155
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:25,599
philippines and and elsewhere

156
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,479
that that kind of harassment actually

157
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,520
has

158
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,318
both online effects and offline effects

159
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,440
it has the effect online of seeking to

160
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,560
silence

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,319
marginalized voices and i think that

162
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,759
part of the dynamic wasn't as clear

163
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,440
i don't think it was as clear to the

164
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
companies um

165
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,000
you know 10 years ago five years ago

166
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,639
even a few years ago

167
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,680
and i think at the same time the way in

168
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,319
which

169
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,440
online harassment was translated and

170
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,639
converted

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,960
into offline harms was was

172
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,039
was less clear it was clear to a lot of

173
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,799
people you know for example my colleague

174
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
in the united states professor danielle

175
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,199
citron

176
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,039
you know has been studying this for many

177
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,280
years in the context of

178
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,240
of sexual violence of gender-based

179
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
violence

180
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,840
but i think that that it's become

181
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:19,520
clearer and clearer that

182
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,560
online harassment or we could talk about

183
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
it as

184
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,680
online interference with um with voting

185
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
rights or with elections that that has

186
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,800
definite

187
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,638
offline harms and that i think that

188
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,680
trend line has become clear and clear to

189
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
people

190
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,240
over time but you know as far as what

191
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,200
what keeps me up at night

192
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
or what kept me up at night or what

193
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,080
concerned me about

194
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,720
maybe put it this way because i'm on the

195
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,000
west coast of the united states so a lot

196
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,200
of things were already happening by the

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,720
time i would wake up

198
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,880
would be what was happening in the in

199
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:54,720
the real world in the physical

200
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:57,839
space which is also a real world um

201
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:01,440
and and i remember early in in january

202
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:04,640
of 2015 waking up to the news

203
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:06,720
of the charlie hebdo massacres in

204
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,560
massacre in paris followed by the

205
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
massacre in a kosher market in paris as

206
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,079
well

207
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,240
and you know it was that kind of you

208
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:18,000
know connection between

209
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,959
the online the the expressive part

210
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
of public space and the potential for

211
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:25,518
violence that

212
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:29,839
that really i think has concerned

213
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,839
me continues to concern me today

214
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
for the over the years talking to you

215
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,240
about this because

216
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,880
i that's what i lived you know it really

217
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,880
is like

218
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:45,040
and i think journalists you know we've

219
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
seen the trend during their

220
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,480
the the time you've had the mandate

221
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,640
journalists have come

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,160
under attack increasingly and the first

223
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,560
attacks are online

224
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,040
uh and these types of i think it the

225
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,000
information is power type of thing that

226
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
the way

227
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,519
that facts have now become debatable and

228
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,439
i guess

229
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,560
uh this is something you said early on

230
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,560
you said that

231
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,040
yes you work with governments but now

232
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,959
increasingly private companies have had

233
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,040
tremendous power i would argue private

234
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,920
companies now have more power than

235
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,120
governments

236
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,120
uh in many instances especially when

237
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
these social media platforms are the

238
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,519
world's largest distributor

239
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,880
of news right so we've gone through from

240
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
the time when

241
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:29,040
i think you mentioned uh you were coming

242
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,160
in after snowden

243
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,880
uh when edward snowden did all of these

244
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,240
the expose that frankly was being done

245
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,200
by government

246
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,519
now you can argue that those same things

247
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
are

248
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:43,680
are even larger in scope the problems

249
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,240
larger in scope

250
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,120
except it's it's now the power is now

251
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,160
being held by

252
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:51,760
american silicon valley companies where

253
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,199
you are in california

254
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,200
how do we handle this

255
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,640
yeah that's the you know i don't know

256
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,240
what the figure is these days for

257
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,680
you know that it used to be a million

258
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,000
dollar question

259
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,680
um you know it's a certainly it's a

260
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,680
trillion dollar question

261
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:14,479
you know how do we handle this this new

262
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,000
space and i think i think it's important

263
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,959
for us

264
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,519
to recognize that that you know because

265
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,719
i think

266
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,079
sometimes we get caught up in thinking

267
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:29,120
about um the platforms

268
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:33,040
as the only vector for harassment

269
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:35,600
and and that's to a certain extent

270
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,719
it's true i mean the platforms have as

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,040
you just said

272
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
they have enormous power they have

273
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,839
enormous power

274
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,240
in in particular in places where there

275
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
is

276
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:50,320
not a a robust

277
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,120
independent media they have particular

278
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,360
power

279
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:55,360
even in democratic societies where there

280
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,760
is robust independent media

281
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
when you know the the disinformation

282
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,880
that we see

283
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:05,119
online gets amplified by

284
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:07,040
you know by traditional by legacy media

285
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:10,560
particularly by broadcast media

286
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,199
so there's there's this real i think

287
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,239
um warranted attention on what's

288
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,720
happening

289
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,639
in digital space and what the platforms

290
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,160
do what their policies are

291
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
i mean as you mentioned i wrote a book

292
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:25,600
on this but but i think

293
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:27,360
also that we cannot ignore the fact

294
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,600
and we should continue to focus on the

295
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:31,680
fact that governments

296
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,639
continue to have massive power they have

297
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
the coercive

298
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,279
authority of the state they have the

299
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,959
regulatory power

300
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,880
they are quite often and i'm often

301
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:45,518
concerned that that we didn't

302
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,399
in the mandate devote as much attention

303
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,920
to this as

304
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:51,600
we should um but on a very very much on

305
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:54,160
a daily basis

306
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,040
governments would look to to social

307
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,120
media

308
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,719
they would say you know what are our

309
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,079
citizens what are people within our

310
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,079
jurisdiction

311
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,319
uh tweeting about what are they posting

312
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,638
on facebook what it what is the youtube

313
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:07,680
video of the day that they are that they

314
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:11,279
are liking or

315
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,399
sharing or creating and they would go

316
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,200
either to the company and say take this

317
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:18,399
down

318
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:20,160
we have you know a significant

319
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:22,560
lack of transparency around that

320
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,079
relationship between government demands

321
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,560
and what companies do although that's

322
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:29,040
improved over the time of my

323
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,399
uh of my mandate but they also go

324
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,160
directly after

325
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:34,959
individuals they they go directly to the

326
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:38,079
person

327
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:41,119
like you who is actually producing

328
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,839
content and that kind of harassment that

329
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,920
direct

330
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:45,839
you know government harassment that

331
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:49,839
persecution of individuals

332
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:52,800
is still very much a live part of

333
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:53,440
of freedom of expression space and so

334
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,240
although

335
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,600
i do think we need to spend you know a

336
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,800
significant amount of time thinking

337
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,600
about how governments

338
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,079
should regulate the companies we should

339
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,560
also

340
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,680
be able to keep in mind the fact that

341
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,079
governments

342
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:12,719
remain i think the most significant

343
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:14,239
abusers of free expression rights of

344
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:16,160
individuals around the world

345
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,680
oftentimes they're using the platforms

346
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,120
you know kind of weaponizing them for

347
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,160
their own purposes as well

348
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:25,120
but they are definitely using that space

349
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,880
for surveillance for you know attack on

350
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,600
speakers and for other

351
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,160
other real interferences with freedom of

352
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,920
expression

353
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,920
and you've experienced this directly

354
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,319
yourself

355
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,240
no absolutely and i guess let's start

356
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
let's start first with governments then

357
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:41,600
let's go to companies and then all of

358
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:44,959
the other things that have

359
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,440
everything to do with tech right the

360
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:48,160
uh the algorithms that determine what

361
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:51,040
kinds of

362
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,839
what we even see how we pull how our

363
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,959
data so

364
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,199
on the government side uh you

365
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,518
your mandate was the time when we began

366
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,680
to see a dictator's playbook

367
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,880
come together and the rise of these

368
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,638
authoritarian

369
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:09,199
populist style leaders who used

370
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,560
social media they were elected and

371
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:13,040
democratically

372
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,719
democratically elected and then were

373
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,760
began to use those

374
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,079
physical world things to use the tools

375
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:22,319
of democracy to consolidate power

376
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:23,920
using not just the real power of

377
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,480
government but also

378
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,160
amplifying their power through the new

379
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,079
technology that was available

380
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:32,319
what was it like to work with

381
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
governments during this time period

382
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:35,360
and because that's significantly

383
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,839
different right uh

384
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:41,680
and then you know what worked

385
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:43,680
effectively

386
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
there it's a it's such a great question

387
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,920
and i want to put a pin in this

388
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,758
also because i want to circle back to

389
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,199
your own experience and talk to you

390
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,160
about that because i think that will be

391
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,319
really

392
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:55,199
uh because your experience was one of

393
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,440
those

394
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,240
your i mean your continuing experience

395
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,240
frankly

396
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:02,160
is one of those that has really informed

397
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:03,759
my understanding of the

398
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,519
the issues that we're talking about

399
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,680
today um

400
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:08,959
i would say you know it's not it's not

401
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
really possible

402
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,239
to characterize interactions with

403
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,720
governments as

404
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,160
one thing only because there's such

405
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,680
diversity

406
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,160
in in the way governments behave toward

407
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,120
uh toward the space of you know towards

408
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:25,439
digital space

409
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,199
towards independent media and so forth

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,079
so you know for example

411
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,719
you have some governments like you know

412
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,359
i would say

413
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,839
some of the scandinavian governments uh

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,959
some

415
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:39,680
you know other european governments um

416
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:40,638
that that have been very open in their

417
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:45,040
way of thinking

418
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,360
about digital space um very open about

419
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:49,439
what what they understand and here like

420
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:52,160
to get into a little bit of a

421
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,600
um you know uh international human

422
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,240
rights law distinction

423
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:57,680
you know we often talk about negative

424
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,759
and positive rights

425
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,439
right you know what government to put it

426
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,240
like bluntly what government

427
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,120
is obligated not to do and then also

428
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:08,240
what government

429
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:10,799
should do in a in an active way to

430
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,640
enable particular environments for for

431
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,639
the enjoyment of human rights

432
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,000
and i think there are some governments

433
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,199
that that still

434
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:22,799
see their role primarily as

435
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:25,679
enabling freedom of expression right

436
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:26,000
creating a regulatory environment that

437
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:29,120
is

438
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:32,240
very very light

439
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,760
if at all on regulating content

440
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:38,480
um but very strong on you know providing

441
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,600
say public service media uh public

442
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,640
broadcasting

443
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,480
um supporting independent voices like

444
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,000
those kinds of governments

445
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,600
those are the governments that are i

446
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,080
think traditionally

447
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,760
in the article 19 of the universal

448
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,320
declaration and the international

449
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,080
covenant

450
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,678
of civil and political rights they're in

451
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:59,439
that space where they

452
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,720
genuinely believe uh and implement

453
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,960
you know the essential features of

454
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,280
freedom of expression those governments

455
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,039
are

456
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,960
are pretty easy to work with they've

457
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:09,679
been supportive of the mandate

458
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,960
um i would especially highlight the

459
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:14,480
government of norway

460
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,600
governments like netherlands austria

461
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:18,400
um others that have been real uh robust

462
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,439
supporters

463
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:23,520
of the work that that we're doing

464
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:25,280
by and i would also say that europe the

465
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:27,760
european commission

466
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,760
which actually provided a grant to my

467
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,520
mandate and to a couple of others

468
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,960
at ohchr the office of the high

469
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,559
commissioner for human rights

470
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,400
also has been very supportive of our

471
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,080
work and we could talk more about

472
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,799
regulation in the in the european

473
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,840
context

474
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,960
as well but i would distinguish that

475
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,360
from the kind of you know

476
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:47,440
heavy-handedness

477
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,439
that we've seen in places like the

478
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:53,200
philippines you know with its

479
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,320
cyber law cyber crime regulation

480
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:59,440
which is being abused to target a person

481
00:18:56,320 --> 00:19:00,159
an independent journalist like you or

482
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,360
governments

483
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:06,000
like turkey or egypt or others

484
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:07,280
that are you know quite regularly

485
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,400
interfering

486
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:10,879
with with digital space with independent

487
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,880
media

488
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,000
going so far in those two examples

489
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,760
turkey and egypt but

490
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:21,039
many others um going so far as to

491
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:24,640
uh to detain journalists merely for

492
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,360
their posts or their likes on on social

493
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,919
media

494
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,000
so i think over the course of my mandate

495
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,200
i've tried to distinguish those but

496
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,720
at the same time recognize that that the

497
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,960
rights apply

498
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,880
across the board everybody enjoys rights

499
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,600
and the obligations apply

500
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,559
to all states and this i mean to give

501
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:45,199
just one

502
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,200
of our most recent examples in in

503
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,360
special procedures that is

504
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
you know the the branch in which all

505
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:54,959
special rapporteurs

506
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:57,520
kind of work with in ohchr

507
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,640
you know china has been we've almost

508
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,760
ignored

509
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,720
china to a certain extent over the years

510
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,600
because

511
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:07,600
it's intense pressure on freedom of

512
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,080
expression has been so evident

513
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,520
to people but i think that and i i'm

514
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,240
overstating by saying that we

515
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,639
we've ignored it but but it's come to a

516
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:20,240
particular head over the last few years

517
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:22,320
with the um incredible i think crimes

518
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
against humanity that involve freedom of

519
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,039
expression

520
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:26,799
you know with respect to the uyghur

521
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,640
community in the far west

522
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:30,400
or what we're seeing right now in hong

523
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:34,000
kong and

524
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:35,520
and we are sort of trying to direct

525
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,919
more and more attention to that and try

526
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,720
to ensure that the international human

527
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:42,080
rights

528
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:44,240
community place places

529
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:46,320
a particular value on ensuring freedom

530
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,120
of expression even in that space

531
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,080
that is so difficult to um to advocate

532
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,840
for so

533
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,280
i mean it's just such a variety of

534
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:53,678
governments it's hard to put them all

535
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
into

536
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,720
into one basket and say our interactions

537
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,000
with governments

538
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:02,159
are are this or that thing

539
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
no no no i mean you did you know i was

540
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:05,039
slightly disappointed because it did

541
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:07,200
take

542
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,400
you're right that you you did uh talk

543
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,880
about eu the

544
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,720
norway and all but in general when

545
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:14,640
journalists were under attack

546
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,640
and partly after the election of

547
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:19,760
president trump in the united states

548
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:20,480
you know it when when we were trying to

549
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,720
fight

550
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,600
for freedom of expression for freedom of

551
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:28,080
the press

552
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:31,360
it was it took until july of 2019 when

553
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:33,520
canada and britain began uh

554
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,240
pulling governments together to stand up

555
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:38,480
for it like actively to help protect

556
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,960
uh journalists like us who've been under

557
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,640
threat it's very welcome also article 19

558
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,440
was there at that meeting in london

559
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,520
right

560
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,840
i guess i'm i'm on the part of the

561
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,918
digital authoritarians

562
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:52,399
what worked best with them because in

563
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:54,080
general again it seems like we're in an

564
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,919
alice in wonderland world where

565
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:58,000
everything is upside down

566
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,600
and you know when you take the phrase

567
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,240
freedom of expression

568
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,760
um it changed drastically what worked

569
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,559
best when you deal with things like that

570
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,000
when

571
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,320
and you mentioned some of those

572
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:10,320
countries already

573
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,360
yeah can maybe if we could just take a

574
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,399
second and

575
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,080
i can ask you also about your experience

576
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,840
because i think that would sharpen

577
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,840
i mean i do think it would sharpen this

578
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,199
this question because i think

579
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,918
what you've experienced i think

580
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,880
in a way that people recognize worldwide

581
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:29,919
now

582
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,159
but i think was was new to people

583
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,159
a couple of years ago was the

584
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:36,159
intersection

585
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:37,840
of government repression and

586
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:41,200
intimidation

587
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:43,840
and uh the the use

588
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,440
the misuse though i don't really like

589
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,000
the term weaponizing

590
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:50,159
but you know the development of

591
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,039
basically troll armies

592
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,080
to harass you and to silence you and i

593
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,480
wonder if you could

594
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:59,199
so as we move into that discussion of

595
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,720
kind of digital authoritarianism

596
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:02,720
what what was you what has your

597
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,159
experience been and maybe i could

598
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,880
if i can ask you a question when did the

599
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:11,120
pressure

600
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:14,640
on you start i assume it was

601
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,239
soon after you founded rappler.com

602
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,240
what what did that look like because you

603
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:20,960
started it before duterte

604
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,600
came to power what what did that look

605
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,520
like

606
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,439
how is and how has that evolved because

607
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:27,520
i think your experiences

608
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,559
is a kind of quintessential experience

609
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,879
that people

610
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,120
uh independent journalists face

611
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,559
everywhere

612
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:39,520
i mean it paralleled the rise you know

613
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,918
we started rappler in 2012 and the goal

614
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,480
there

615
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,840
we embraced technology to build

616
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
communities of action

617
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:46,959
so it was really you know investigative

618
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,918
journalism

619
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:50,640
coupled with tech and then using that we

620
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:52,799
could build

621
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:54,480
communities and the end goal was to make

622
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,879
our world better right like everything

623
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
else

624
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,799
that was 2012. um i think

625
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,960
everything changed and we didn't realize

626
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,639
this but in 2014

627
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,600
you can see kind of uh globally you can

628
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,799
see this

629
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:13,120
this push towards uh

630
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,039
leaders who could just take away the

631
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,918
problem of the complexity of the world

632
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:19,440
and i'll look at like india and then

633
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,240
indonesia

634
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:23,600
large populations right and so there was

635
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:25,120
that human thing

636
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:27,199
that the world had just gotten so

637
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,559
complex that you know i can't think

638
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,559
through it all please just give me a

639
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,279
leader who will tell me what to do

640
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:34,799
and we saw that shift i when i covered

641
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:38,240
the indonesian elections

642
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:40,559
between jokowi and uh the

643
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,320
former the son-in-law of uh former

644
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,600
president suharto who had been in power

645
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:46,639
for 32 years

646
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:49,360
when we start when in the philippines we

647
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:51,679
didn't come under attack until 2016.

648
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:54,080
and i i think 2016 is when all the

649
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,520
dominoes began to fall and i would say

650
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,439
the philippines was

651
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:58,960
because we were a testing ground for a

652
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,080
lot of these tactics of mass

653
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,240
manipulation

654
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:03,120
the election of president duterte i i

655
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,919
would say is

656
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,479
legitimate absolutely he did use social

657
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,400
media

658
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:10,080
he was the first to use it to win the

659
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:13,440
top office

660
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,158
but in 2016 we began to question

661
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,880
impunity

662
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:18,159
of the drug war a brutal drug war and

663
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:20,400
the impunity of

664
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:21,200
a propaganda war and this is where it

665
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,799
all began and

666
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,360
i think unlike you i'm really convinced

667
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,520
i'm

668
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,719
because of what we've lived through that

669
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:31,840
it begins

670
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:35,520
with these lies

671
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,639
that are seeded to attack journalists

672
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:41,039
human rights activists in our case also

673
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,080
opposition politicians so the attacks

674
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,440
against me began

675
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,760
online first uh after we published a

676
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,240
three-part series the propaganda war

677
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:51,440
where we actually showed you what was

678
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,000
happening because we live

679
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,480
on social media so we felt the tenor

680
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,400
change

681
00:25:54,480 --> 00:26:01,039
immediately and it was in 2016. um

682
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,919
after detect remember duterte was

683
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:03,760
elected in may

684
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,039
and then brexit happened a month later

685
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,240
and then that's when the rest of the

686
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:09,120
dominoes fell

687
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,720
our three-part series was that the

688
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,678
weaponizing the internet

689
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,360
the second was how facebook algorithms

690
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,520
impact democracy because

691
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,639
that early we really could see it and

692
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,720
feel it

693
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,919
and then the third was manufactured

694
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:25,120
consensus

695
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:27,600
how 26 fake accounts could

696
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:29,199
could influence three million others we

697
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,918
manually counted that

698
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:34,240
and that horrified me and we were

699
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:36,720
essentially alpha partners of facebook

700
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:39,120
so i brought this data to facebook

701
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:41,200
and when we published the series all of

702
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:44,399
a sudden that's when i got pounded with

703
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:47,200
90 hate messages per hour

704
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,600
and that continued and the and you said

705
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,919
this

706
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:52,399
the end goal of that is to pound you to

707
00:26:49,919 --> 00:26:53,039
silence so that takes that takes a

708
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,520
journalist

709
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:57,440
out and it was so new that we didn't

710
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,158
know what it was no one knew how to deal

711
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,520
with it

712
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:04,799
uh we learned um and then

713
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:07,120
i the second part is to

714
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:08,080
create a bandwagon effect that wasn't

715
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:10,799
real i mean

716
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,678
oxford university coined manufactured

717
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,320
consensus

718
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:16,400
that makes sense to me now but how it

719
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,960
changed over time was more interesting

720
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,039
to me

721
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,000
right this um i've talked to you about

722
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,360
this how

723
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,200
journalism journalist equals criminal

724
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,959
you pointed out this is used everywhere

725
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,799
around the world but in our case

726
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
that narrative was seated on social

727
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:35,039
media in 2016.

728
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:37,840
in 2017 uh astro turfing bottom up

729
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,440
was met top down by president duterte

730
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:42,480
saying the same thing

731
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:43,600
and that was pounded a million times so

732
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,240
more and more people

733
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:48,480
were getting slowly sandwiched the air

734
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:51,120
is coming out then in 2018

735
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
weaponizing the law 11 cases and

736
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:56,158
investigations

737
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,120
2019 arrests eight arrest warrants

738
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:00,399
two arrests in five weeks detention and

739
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,559
then 2020

740
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,719
the these cases have been ongoing and

741
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:07,279
then in 2020 a conviction

742
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,919
in june 15. so journalist equals

743
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:10,720
criminal

744
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,240
which was far-fetched in 2016 because i

745
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,159
thought wow i've been a journalist a

746
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,679
long time there's a whole track record

747
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,840
it doesn't matter track record doesn't

748
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:18,880
matter because you recreate reality

749
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,959
online

750
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:21,919
and i guess this is we can talk more

751
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,240
about what

752
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
men you know what why facts are

753
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,480
debatable but

754
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,279
then by 2020 here it is a court has

755
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:32,080
convicted

756
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:33,679
and journalist is equals criminal that's

757
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,720
crazy david

758
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:38,240
you know so how do we protect

759
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,600
this has also been one of the things

760
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,679
you've had to deal with more and more

761
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,240
journalists coming under attack

762
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,240
uh trying to hold power to account

763
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:53,600
brilliant summation of the last several

764
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,320
years that you've lived

765
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,678
and one of the things that i think is

766
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,799
really important about what you just

767
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:01,919
described

768
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,120
is this accretion of

769
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:07,440
repressive moves right so on the one

770
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:09,199
it starts with with investigative

771
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,520
reporting i mean this is a tr

772
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:13,200
something that i've seen also around the

773
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,639
world it could be investigative

774
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,000
reporting it could also be

775
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,880
independent bloggers who are either

776
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,279
reporting

777
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,799
or doing opinion work that is somehow

778
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,080
out of the mainstream

779
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:29,440
so it starts with it starts with content

780
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,000
with expression that is somehow at odds

781
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,279
with the

782
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:35,200
the conventional uh sense of what either

783
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,320
society or what government wants and

784
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:39,360
mostly it's about

785
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,120
what government wants media to say so

786
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,918
there's that substantive element at the

787
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,439
beginning

788
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,200
and then there's i think what you

789
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,919
described is so important because

790
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:49,840
we've seen this time after time it's

791
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,919
this redefinition

792
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:53,120
of journalism of the sharing of

793
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,159
information

794
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:56,719
as criminal um you know in a place like

795
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,520
turkey

796
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,640
it's you know journalism equals

797
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,799
terrorism

798
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,720
right if you're reporting on the

799
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:07,279
situation of the kurds

800
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,080
uh you know you're a terrorist if you

801
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,399
are reporting

802
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:14,000
on the coup attempt from july of 2016

803
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,239
which is also happening during this

804
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:17,039
period that you're describing that early

805
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,960
period

806
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:20,559
well then you're also you know you're a

807
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,559
ghoulianist you're a part of the

808
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,520
the coup plotters so there's this

809
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:27,200
redefinition in law and i think that's

810
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:28,879
that that is particularly important

811
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:31,440
because that

812
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:32,799
that legal change part of it is also

813
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,240
what is then

814
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:37,360
used by government and this this was i

815
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,960
think a very

816
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,559
i think nefarious use of this by

817
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,080
by the government in the philippines

818
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,879
against you which is

819
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,320
they create the law they allow this law

820
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,840
this cyber crime law

821
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,158
to exist and then they make it available

822
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,158
to

823
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,240
individuals to ostensibly

824
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:59,039
non-governmental individuals

825
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,240
to enforce it against you and then the

826
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,640
government says

827
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,080
what this isn't about us i mean this

828
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,120
isn't this isn't government

829
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,678
action this is this is a private actor

830
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,239
who is claiming defamation by maria

831
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,760
ressa

832
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,159
and rappler i mean that's that's clever

833
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
right but ultimately it is about that

834
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,600
that change

835
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,240
in law and then when you layer on top of

836
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
that

837
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,240
the actual you know the the

838
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:27,120
computational propaganda side the

839
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:28,960
the manufactured consent the manipulated

840
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:32,799
consent that you describe

841
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:35,440
which is is extra legal you know it's a

842
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,639
it's a kind of perfect storm i hate to

843
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:39,200
use that phrase

844
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:41,200
but it is kind of a perfect storm of

845
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,480
kind of government repression

846
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:48,240
mixed with um you know the the

847
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:51,600
advent of of mass trolling which

848
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,919
is designed to silence opposition

849
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,279
and not just opposition because i mean

850
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,080
my experience has been journalists don't

851
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:58,640
want to be

852
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:59,519
framed as opposition you're independent

853
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,600
actors

854
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,720
who are conducting you know

855
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:05,199
investigative work

856
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:07,200
trying to you know get at whatever kind

857
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,559
of facts and truth we can identify you

858
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,440
can identify

859
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:13,200
but you know that's that's undermined by

860
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,559
by all of these things and i guess i'm

861
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,279
i'm curious from your perspective

862
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:21,440
what should be social media what should

863
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:22,880
be the platform's role i know in the

864
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,799
philippines

865
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,159
you know facebook played a major role in

866
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,279
this but you know it's not just

867
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,399
facebook it's in some places twitter um

868
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,360
in others it could be

869
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,639
youtube in others it could be you know

870
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:36,879
it could be wechat

871
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:38,080
or you know v contact it could be you

872
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,000
know any of these different

873
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,279
uh actors out there and i'm curious what

874
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
you or tick tock

875
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,640
you know what what what do you think the

876
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,439
companies

877
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,480
should be doing in the face of what is

878
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:50,480
admittedly

879
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,960
you know government pressure government

880
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:55,039
demands

881
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:56,399
yeah it's interesting when you when you

882
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:58,480
put it that way so

883
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:00,479
like in the in the philippines the the

884
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:02,559
penetration of facebook a hundred

885
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,360
percent of filipinos on the internet are

886
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:07,360
on facebook

887
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:10,240
it is our internet but 98

888
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,760
are on youtube right the penetration

889
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,960
rate of youtube which is the world's

890
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,000
second largest

891
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:18,080
uh search large search engine is huge

892
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,120
and they go hand in hand so it isn't

893
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,080
just one

894
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:23,279
uh uh one thing or another they're all

895
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:26,639
interconnected

896
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,360
and anyway so what should they do

897
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,840
so i'm curious to hear what you think

898
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,199
because

899
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,600
in my mind now increasingly i went

900
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:37,120
early on to say no there should be no

901
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:39,199
regulation because i

902
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,719
because as a journalist we are

903
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,559
self-regulating right and

904
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:45,519
and we've had a set of standards and

905
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:46,240
ethics uh that we go by we protect the

906
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,880
public's

907
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,840
fear we are accountable for protecting

908
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:52,240
the public sphere

909
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,840
when we distributed the news so i think

910
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:56,960
the first step for me

911
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:59,918
is that the platforms need to own

912
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,080
the problem because journalists news

913
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,880
organizations no longer distribute the

914
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,240
news

915
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:09,359
technology does and in many ways

916
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:11,280
a abdicated responsibility for the

917
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:14,399
public sphere because

918
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:18,079
the way the social media platforms are

919
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,040
are designed uh it doesn't prioritize

920
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:23,440
facts and there's no accountability for

921
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:26,239
the exponential spread of lies

922
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:27,440
so in behavior-wise what we've really

923
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:30,879
seen is that

924
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,440
uh lies laced with anger and hate spread

925
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:34,319
faster than the facts which are really

926
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,679
boring

927
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,040
so that's that's part of it that

928
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,520
that one thing um has has made

929
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:45,520
facts debatable i think that's the other

930
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:48,399
problem that i see in the design

931
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,839
is that built into the design is us

932
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:52,799
against them

933
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:54,960
this idea of growth coming from

934
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,240
recommending friends of friends

935
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,040
has actually divided democracies divided

936
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,040
everyone

937
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:03,040
and it becomes an us against them

938
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,359
because it's

939
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,320
you know it's a spectator sport that's

940
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:09,040
how the

941
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:10,000
the cluster how human behavior has

942
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,480
shifted to it

943
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,040
and i guess the the most radical thing

944
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,079
that i've

945
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,279
embraced in the last four years is that

946
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,000
these platforms are not

947
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:23,440
they are behavioral modification systems

948
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,040
if you take them as a whole and then

949
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:27,119
let's bring in the rest of

950
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,560
of what technology's brought in right

951
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,440
data data privacy data protection

952
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,400
artificial intelligence when you take

953
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:37,599
all of that

954
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:38,560
and uh you you combine it with micro

955
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:41,280
targeting

956
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,880
uh you can essentially these platforms

957
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:46,240
know us better than we know

958
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,079
ourselves and they sell our weakest

959
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:50,640
moment to a message

960
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,760
to a company or a government or anyone

961
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:55,200
else

962
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,560
so that we are served that message

963
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,200
at the optimum time to change the way we

964
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,279
think

965
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,240
so behavioral modification system i've

966
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:05,680
seen it work

967
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,759
environment propaganda uh i have not

968
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:09,440
done anything different

969
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,440
next year will be my 35th year as a

970
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:13,119
journalist and i am you know following

971
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,000
the standards and ethics that have

972
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:16,800
that we always have and yet journalism

973
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
is equals from

974
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,640
i i've been convicted i could go to jail

975
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:24,960
that's crazy

976
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:26,799
enabled by tech and so yeah that's the

977
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:28,720
struggle for us and you know we've

978
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,119
leaned on you for anyone who doesn't

979
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:34,640
know of course david cage

980
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,240
also uh filed an amicus brief in the

981
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,520
cyber libel case

982
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:42,799
that was went on trial last year and

983
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:44,720
on june 15th i and a former colleague of

984
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,880
mine were convicted of cyber libel a

985
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:49,759
retroactive application of the law

986
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:51,760
so thank you david but his wonderfully

987
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:52,640
written amicus brief which i got to read

988
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:56,000
this

989
00:36:52,640 --> 00:37:00,160
was dismissed by judge montessa as

990
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:00,160
noted one word noted right

991
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:07,920
that's true i so before we get to that

992
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,200
um on you know on the on the social

993
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:12,880
media companies

994
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,000
and their responsibilities you know i

995
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:17,440
um so i this is i think it's a it's a

996
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:20,960
complicated

997
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,079
situation for for all of us

998
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,119
in part because you know over

999
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,240
over time you know we have we've

1000
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:33,119
really we haven't fully learned

1001
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:34,160
what for example you mentioned you know

1002
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:37,680
the ai

1003
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:39,839
tools that are engaged in

1004
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,359
in in providing us and serving us up

1005
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,240
with with information

1006
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:45,200
we have limited insight into how those

1007
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,759
operate

1008
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:49,439
and you know for from my perspective i

1009
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:52,800
mean one of the things

1010
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,839
that we've been trying to to call on

1011
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,880
on the companies themselves to do in

1012
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,320
order to

1013
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,000
to address all of these different

1014
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,200
problems that were that you've just

1015
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,240
described and that

1016
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,319
we're talking about is to is to look at

1017
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:08,399
these problems and to look at their

1018
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:10,720
products right to look at their

1019
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:14,000
platforms and by products it could be

1020
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:15,520
you know the ai tools the um you know

1021
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,760
the algorithmic

1022
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,800
uh functioning of their of their

1023
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,280
platforms

1024
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,280
they have to look at them and ask what

1025
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:26,000
are the human rights implications

1026
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,359
of every single product that we are

1027
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
presenting to the public

1028
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,520
and and do basically a an impact

1029
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,240
assessment you know

1030
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,200
we talk about environmental impact

1031
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,279
assessments

1032
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:39,279
for you know for all sorts of projects

1033
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:42,000
that might have an implication

1034
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,359
for the environment or or for climate or

1035
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,520
or other issues

1036
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,440
we should have those for human rights as

1037
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,680
well those should be standard

1038
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:50,720
and i think one of the things that that

1039
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,919
we've tried to do

1040
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:55,520
in the mandate is i mean

1041
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:57,520
or that i've tried to do a special

1042
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,440
rapporteur and that my colleagues other

1043
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,839
rapper tours have tried to do

1044
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,760
is to look at the tool of the un's

1045
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,359
guiding principles on business and human

1046
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,800
rights which are you know a nine

1047
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,480
a non-binding set of standards

1048
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,640
that say you know governments have the

1049
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:14,480
obligation to protect human rights

1050
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:16,480
but companies which are not you know

1051
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:19,359
formally bound by human rights law

1052
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,200
they do have a responsibility to ensure

1053
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:22,480
that their products don't interfere with

1054
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:24,399
the human rights

1055
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,599
of people and they should have human

1056
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,079
rights policies

1057
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:30,000
they should have and you know as part of

1058
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,720
human rights policy making

1059
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,160
they should be transparent about the

1060
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,720
nature of their products

1061
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:37,759
what they've done to analyze whether

1062
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,560
those products

1063
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:42,240
do have an implication for human rights

1064
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,560
they should be able to

1065
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,359
share all of that information with

1066
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,880
experts

1067
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,960
you know one thing if you talk to any

1068
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,040
researcher in

1069
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,560
you know in the field of of digital

1070
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:55,359
rights or of

1071
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:56,320
internet and society it is extremely

1072
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,160
difficult

1073
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:02,240
to get access to the underlying data

1074
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:03,359
that that companies have which is

1075
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,240
massive

1076
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,520
um and to actually study the the

1077
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,240
behavioral

1078
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,960
and human rights implications of those

1079
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,560
products

1080
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,960
those should be made available to

1081
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,160
researchers once we have that which we

1082
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,640
don't have now

1083
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,399
i think we're in a better position to to

1084
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,640
really promote

1085
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,880
and identify specific fixes that should

1086
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,879
be undertaken by the companies

1087
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:29,440
right now we we just we don't have that

1088
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:31,520
to a very significant degree

1089
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,720
and i think that's been that's been a

1090
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:35,920
hindrance

1091
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:37,279
in part also you know because and you

1092
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,599
said this right i think at the very

1093
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:41,599
outset you know a lot of

1094
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,960
a lot of the people who are involved in

1095
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,160
regulating

1096
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:47,440
um the internet or media around the

1097
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,799
world

1098
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,960
they may tend to be um you know

1099
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,119
have let's say they've grown up in an

1100
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,720
environment that is non-technical

1101
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,400
that does not involve digital space and

1102
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:01,839
um and i think that when we start

1103
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,640
talking about

1104
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,078
algorithmic transparency for example

1105
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:07,598
oftentimes those people

1106
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:08,960
don't you know they don't engage in that

1107
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:10,640
conversation it's a little bit

1108
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:12,400
frightening to them to think oh this is

1109
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,240
math this is going to be hard

1110
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:16,240
but i think we really need to and this

1111
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:18,799
may be a generational change

1112
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:19,279
issue we really need to get to the place

1113
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,960
where

1114
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:26,079
particularly transparency regulation

1115
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:27,119
disclosures by companies becomes a part

1116
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:29,920
of the norm

1117
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:31,280
that's required by government regulation

1118
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,880
that that's going to have to be

1119
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,920
an essential part of how we move forward

1120
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,240
well this you know using human rights uh

1121
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,960
the u.n declaration of human rights as

1122
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:43,439
one of the

1123
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:44,240
the ways to actually start thinking

1124
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:46,240
about

1125
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,319
for the social media for these tech

1126
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,879
companies silicon valley let's put it

1127
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:52,640
that way

1128
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,800
uh in speech police you said they should

1129
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,680
bring this in and yes we've seen some

1130
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,240
movements

1131
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:00,160
you know they've hired people who are

1132
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,118
who are doing human rights but beyond

1133
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:03,440
that

1134
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:04,800
you're talking about wanting data but

1135
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,000
the reality is the

1136
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:08,319
impact is already very clear you know we

1137
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:10,640
can

1138
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:11,599
quant researchers can quantify the data

1139
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:14,480
and come up with

1140
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:15,200
more nuanced reactions but that's i

1141
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:18,319
guess

1142
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,200
if you're like me you want it right now

1143
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:22,160
we know yeah you know this in your book

1144
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,560
in myanmar

1145
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:26,720
it's been proven the u.n did their own

1146
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:28,400
report uh marzuki darusman from

1147
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,520
indonesia led that team

1148
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,520
and proved that social media was a

1149
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:36,880
factor in genocide

1150
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:38,720
genocide right we've the stuff that's

1151
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,400
happened in other parts of the world

1152
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:43,040
this is already proven

1153
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,560
no one is held accountable and human

1154
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,640
rights are frankly

1155
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:48,240
trampled my human rights have been

1156
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:52,000
trampled what do we do

1157
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:54,078
in the in the short and medium term

1158
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,359
yeah this is so this is really important

1159
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,960
and that this is

1160
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:58,799
this is why there's there's so many

1161
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,040
different discussions

1162
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,640
around the impact of social media right

1163
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:04,880
so one is the algorithmic and

1164
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,560
the the the manufactured consent that

1165
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:09,040
you were describing and then

1166
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,920
there's the other which is you know and

1167
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:12,640
myanmar

1168
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,920
provides a really good example and in

1169
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:15,680
fact i think

1170
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:17,520
over the last couple of months looking

1171
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:19,040
at the debate how the debate has changed

1172
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:22,480
in the united states

1173
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,480
provides an interesting

1174
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,560
set of insights around this as well so

1175
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,280
in the case of myanmar

1176
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,720
you know facebook and but this is true

1177
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:33,520
of all platforms

1178
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,480
they have extraordinarily limited

1179
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,280
insight

1180
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:38,560
into what is happening at local levels

1181
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,400
and that that's not just

1182
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,319
sort of the national levels you know

1183
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:44,720
what was happening across

1184
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:45,520
myanmar or what was happening in rakhine

1185
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,680
state

1186
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:48,640
uh what was happening to the rohingya

1187
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,319
community

1188
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,799
it's also at the you know what what

1189
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,200
chiang mai arun calls the hyper local

1190
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,319
you know it's what was happening at the

1191
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:59,359
level of

1192
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:02,400
you know towns and villages

1193
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,799
where people are using these tools

1194
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:06,480
in order to share information some of

1195
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,440
the information they're sharing

1196
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:09,839
might be disinformation a good portion

1197
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,000
of it

1198
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,599
particularly in the myanmar context was

1199
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,760
information about

1200
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:18,480
where the next threat of violence might

1201
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:20,319
be coming from so it could be protective

1202
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,160
but the problem was because of the

1203
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,200
platforms just complete

1204
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,200
dominance of information in that space

1205
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,480
they had a special responsibility and

1206
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,839
continue to have a special

1207
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:33,119
responsibility

1208
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:34,240
to you know one ensure that local

1209
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,880
communities

1210
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,520
have some kind of ownership of the

1211
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,079
platform

1212
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,759
you know what that means exactly is is

1213
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,480
up for some very serious thinking and

1214
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,440
debate

1215
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:46,880
but right now you know local communities

1216
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:50,000
and national communities

1217
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:50,319
have virtually no ownership of this you

1218
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,000
know

1219
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:57,119
of the or you know the sets of major

1220
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:00,160
tools these major platforms of

1221
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:02,960
of public space of public debate

1222
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,879
you know it's like i mean i i imagine

1223
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,520
this as

1224
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:08,000
you know a situation where you have you

1225
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:11,440
know a

1226
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:11,920
dominant public forum and it's all being

1227
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:14,160
run

1228
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:14,960
by people who have no idea about what

1229
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,520
that public

1230
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:18,079
involves and we need to get to a point

1231
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,720
where

1232
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:22,400
you know there's often a discussion and

1233
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,279
this just happened in the united states

1234
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:25,520
yesterday

1235
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:27,119
you know discussion of antitrust and

1236
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:28,880
breaking up companies

1237
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,640
to a certain extent i think we should

1238
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,480
also be talking about

1239
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,759
whether the companies need to be somehow

1240
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,760
broken down

1241
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:37,040
like how do we get them to be closer to

1242
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:39,760
the communities

1243
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,319
where they're actually regulating public

1244
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,720
debate

1245
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:43,520
where they're actually regulating public

1246
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:46,480
space

1247
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:46,960
that that for me is a is a real major

1248
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,839
problem

1249
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:50,400
and i think we've seen this in a in a

1250
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,440
kind of

1251
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:55,119
in an odd way in the united states over

1252
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:55,839
the development of the black lives

1253
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,400
matter

1254
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:59,359
protest so you know i think rashad

1255
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,800
robinson was

1256
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:04,560
was on did a a a fireside chat earlier

1257
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,760
in the week for rights con

1258
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,839
and you know what he's done in um

1259
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,960
and with with anti-defamation league and

1260
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:14,240
with others

1261
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:15,760
in terms of highlighting the role that

1262
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:18,959
the platforms play

1263
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:21,040
in spreading hate um that's been

1264
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,680
extraordinary and it's really gotten the

1265
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,960
attention

1266
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:27,598
of advertisers in the united states

1267
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:28,079
but what's remarkable to me is that this

1268
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:31,359
is only

1269
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:34,240
happening now you know this kind of

1270
00:46:31,359 --> 00:46:35,040
action against in that case against

1271
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:37,118
facebook

1272
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:38,880
you know it's only happening now like so

1273
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:41,280
employees are now

1274
00:46:38,880 --> 00:46:43,520
you know if the companies are are kind

1275
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,880
of organizing themselves

1276
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,119
and complaining about the way executives

1277
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,640
are making decisions on issues like hate

1278
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:53,440
speech and racism

1279
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:55,040
and white supremacy on the platform but

1280
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:57,119
you know for facebook

1281
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,160
the platform is global you know only

1282
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:00,800
about 10

1283
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:02,078
of the platform is is its user base is

1284
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:04,480
in the united states

1285
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:06,319
so where has been the outrage over all

1286
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:07,520
of these other kinds of issues

1287
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,200
you know particularly the kind that

1288
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,440
you've described in the philippines

1289
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:14,640
where's been the outrage the action

1290
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,480
when it comes to the global situation

1291
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:18,560
and i think that's something that that

1292
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:21,680
the it's not just the companies but we

1293
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:23,599
as as advocates as

1294
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:25,279
um as researchers we need to come to

1295
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:26,960
terms with you know this is

1296
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:28,640
you know we're not just talking about

1297
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:29,839
problems in one particular space we're

1298
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:31,440
talking about

1299
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:33,920
this happening you know we're talking

1300
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,599
about you know for example the impact of

1301
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,200
facebook on the us elections well

1302
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:40,480
it's happening everywhere it happens in

1303
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:41,200
the elections in the philippines it

1304
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:43,359
happens

1305
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,799
in elections in india i mean you can go

1306
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,598
on and on about where it's having that

1307
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,160
impact

1308
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:49,440
and the discussion tends to be limited

1309
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,118
to those environments

1310
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,559
and there's not a lot of response from

1311
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:53,920
the companies in the way that we're

1312
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,920
seeing the response right now in the

1313
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,119
united states

1314
00:47:55,920 --> 00:48:01,359
yeah and and actually that's why it's

1315
00:47:59,119 --> 00:48:02,160
so the few things that you said you know

1316
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:03,680
number one

1317
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:06,000
uh how do they get to know the

1318
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:07,118
communities well when i had to set up

1319
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,119
the jakarta bureau

1320
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:13,280
i spent months years

1321
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:15,119
understanding the legal system and the

1322
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:16,079
communities that i was going to be

1323
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:19,599
reporting about

1324
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,680
and even a reporter i couldn't really

1325
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:23,680
there's always a gap between a western

1326
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,078
news organization and the

1327
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:27,359
and the southeast asian countries that i

1328
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:29,280
was reporting on and

1329
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,040
that just took time so i think in some

1330
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:32,960
ways what you mentioned which is

1331
00:48:31,040 --> 00:48:34,480
how will these platforms how will these

1332
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,359
companies understand the local

1333
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,319
communities

1334
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:38,799
it takes time and the problem is that

1335
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:40,880
they

1336
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:43,040
did not invest in the people and they

1337
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:46,079
did not invest in time because

1338
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:46,640
exponential growth that allowed for more

1339
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,760
money

1340
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:51,200
also meant that they did a

1341
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:53,839
one-size-fits-all and the countries

1342
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,558
like myanmar like the philippines are

1343
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,440
not

1344
00:48:54,559 --> 00:48:59,119
there you know we're not despite all of

1345
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,960
the negative effects i always say

1346
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,880
you know the global south deals with

1347
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,800
silicon valley's decision so

1348
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,400
that's the first how do you get them to

1349
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:08,720
deal with community sure

1350
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:10,079
they've hired more people who speak the

1351
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:12,000
language but that's like

1352
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,000
that's not even it so and then the

1353
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
second thing you mentioned stop wait for

1354
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,599
profit

1355
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,640
right the whole goal of all of these

1356
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:21,680
exponential

1357
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:23,920
attacks is to incite hate

1358
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:26,000
uh i think again over the last four

1359
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:28,559
years i've just been recently

1360
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,240
showing all of the things that are meant

1361
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:33,440
to dehumanize me

1362
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,160
i see it i wake up to it and when i show

1363
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,079
this to

1364
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,920
you know that to the public to something

1365
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:41,119
that you people get shot

1366
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:44,160
because it's so it's so visceral and

1367
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,280
demeaning that is what it's meant to do

1368
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:49,200
so yes i'm thrilled sacha baron cohen

1369
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:50,640
did that the anti-defamation league is

1370
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,598
doing that work but

1371
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:54,960
the journalists women in particular

1372
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:56,559
because in the philippines for example

1373
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:58,240
women are attacked ten times more than

1374
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:59,599
men

1375
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,839
this is what we're living through and

1376
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,520
the end goal of all of that inciting to

1377
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:05,440
hate

1378
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:08,000
can lead to violence this is what i

1379
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,480
worry about for rappler and for our team

1380
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:11,760
online violence leads to real world

1381
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:15,440
violence something else

1382
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,720
that we know right um so

1383
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:22,240
this is already a given you know how

1384
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:25,279
how do we how do we

1385
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:27,759
get some sense of how do we get some

1386
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,000
protection

1387
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,040
yeah i you know on this on this last

1388
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:34,240
point on

1389
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,440
the impact on on women journalists

1390
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:40,558
in particular and the kind of

1391
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:43,920
i think imbalance in terms

1392
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,119
of of attacks i i'll just give one

1393
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:47,920
example

1394
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:48,559
or it could be two examples actually um

1395
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:50,960
so

1396
00:50:48,559 --> 00:50:52,640
over the last several years i've

1397
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:55,520
collaborated closely as

1398
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,879
i think people know with on yes calamari

1399
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,359
who's the special rapporteur

1400
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,119
on extra judicial killings and summary

1401
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:03,680
executions

1402
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:06,640
we've collaborated in the context of the

1403
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:08,160
attacks on the media in the philippines

1404
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:10,078
and we've also collaborated in the

1405
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,598
context of the murder of

1406
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:16,960
jamal khashoggi the washington post uh

1407
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:20,480
correspondent uh opinion journalist

1408
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:23,359
um who was murdered by by saudi

1409
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:24,000
by by saudi officials you know i think

1410
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,640
um

1411
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:28,160
in it it certainly appears with the

1412
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:30,558
involvement of

1413
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:31,279
uh the crown prince uh muhammad bin

1414
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,319
salman

1415
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,599
so in those contexts we've both been

1416
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:39,279
pretty vocal about our concerns both of

1417
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,079
government repression

1418
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:42,400
government intimidation and the role of

1419
00:51:42,079 --> 00:51:45,599
of

1420
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:47,839
other governments in in their silence

1421
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:49,200
and um and in and in the context of

1422
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,040
social media

1423
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:54,960
in each of those contexts onyes is the

1424
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:59,119
one who has suffered the most

1425
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:02,160
in terms of trolling attacks online

1426
00:51:59,119 --> 00:52:05,200
basically twitter campaigns against her

1427
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:07,359
and i you know as a as you know i think

1428
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:09,200
a white male who's also involved in this

1429
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,240
haven't i have not received the same

1430
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:13,359
kind of

1431
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,919
of attack it's just i think an example

1432
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:17,359
of the way in which this attempted

1433
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,160
silencing

1434
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:21,200
is is not only prevalent you know

1435
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,200
against journalists

1436
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:24,799
but also human rights workers and it has

1437
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,919
a i think a differential

1438
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,400
impact often uh on on women

1439
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:31,760
in these cases so i i mean i think what

1440
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,800
you know what we're talking about when

1441
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:35,280
we talk about

1442
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:37,680
harassment and silencing it's it's

1443
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:39,599
clearly not just about silencing of

1444
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:42,160
journalists and investigative

1445
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:43,119
uh people in in the field of human

1446
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,960
rights but also

1447
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:46,240
you know people who are doing the work

1448
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:48,000
as mandated

1449
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:49,839
by the u.n human rights council to

1450
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:52,960
collect information and report it to the

1451
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,960
international community

1452
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:58,880
um yes i think again

1453
00:52:57,200 --> 00:53:01,359
the work the two of you have done have

1454
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,880
been amazing um

1455
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:04,400
can i bring you back because we're

1456
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,359
running out of time we have

1457
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:08,079
a few minutes and i definitely have last

1458
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:11,839
words but

1459
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:14,880
one last big question i have is uh

1460
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:17,599
again it goes back to this idea of how

1461
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:19,599
facts are now debatable how we have

1462
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:21,119
alternative realities

1463
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:22,880
uh to hear that come out of the white

1464
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:26,800
house was also interesting for me

1465
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:28,800
right but in in a time like that where

1466
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:30,160
we know we are being actively

1467
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:32,880
manipulated

1468
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,720
geopolitical power play has gone down to

1469
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:37,920
the individual level

1470
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:42,240
uh and what like this when so

1471
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:45,440
when it is like that is it even possible

1472
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:48,479
to have a democracy do we have

1473
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:50,960
integrity of elections if we don't have

1474
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:50,960
facts

1475
00:53:53,040 --> 00:54:00,240
yeah i mean that is maria that is a huge

1476
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:03,520
question right and i think i think that

1477
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:06,160
um all too often

1478
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:08,839
we're not having that conversation you

1479
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:11,920
know we're not having that conversation

1480
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:14,078
about the way in which

1481
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:15,680
well let me maybe step back a little bit

1482
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:16,880
and be i'll be a little bit more

1483
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,680
specific

1484
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,280
um you know mark zuckerberg gave a big

1485
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:25,440
uh kind of well

1486
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:28,000
um reported talk at georgetown last year

1487
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:28,800
where he talked about the commitment of

1488
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,680
facebook

1489
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,800
to freedom of expression and i think

1490
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:34,240
that that's

1491
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,920
you know i i think that's that's

1492
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:37,759
valuable i'm i'm

1493
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,200
obviously a special rapporteur on

1494
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:42,960
freedom of expression

1495
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:45,118
to hear a ceo of a platform say

1496
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:46,480
freedom of expression is essential to

1497
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,960
our work you know that's

1498
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,599
that's heartening that's that's nice the

1499
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,240
problem

1500
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:53,040
is and i think this isn't just a a

1501
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:55,200
zuckerberg

1502
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,079
problem or facebook problem but it's a

1503
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:58,960
problem

1504
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:59,520
perhaps for social media and also maybe

1505
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:02,160
for

1506
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:03,920
all of our understanding of what what

1507
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:05,759
freedom of expression is

1508
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:07,280
i mean the way zuckerberg talked about

1509
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:10,960
freedom of expression

1510
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:14,240
and also frankly the way the debate over

1511
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,559
trump's tweets that that really uh

1512
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,399
were on the edge of not involving

1513
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:21,040
incitement to violence

1514
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:21,680
during the black lives matter protests i

1515
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,480
think the

1516
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:26,399
the assessment was somehow that because

1517
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,359
he's a politician

1518
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,480
he has a particular right to speak that

1519
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,160
is different from

1520
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:34,880
the ordinary citizens right to speak and

1521
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,640
i think that's

1522
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:38,880
that's actually not the right way to

1523
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,078
think about freedom of expression

1524
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:45,359
and i mean this gives me a chance to to

1525
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,119
you know quote article 19 of the

1526
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:48,400
national covenant on civil and political

1527
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:51,599
rights which again

1528
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:55,040
echoes the universal declaration and

1529
00:55:51,599 --> 00:55:58,319
article 19 guarantees everyone the right

1530
00:55:55,040 --> 00:56:00,160
to seek receive and impart information

1531
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,640
and ideas of all kinds

1532
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:03,839
regardless of frontiers and through any

1533
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:06,480
media

1534
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,319
but that that core it's about seeking

1535
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:11,920
and receiving information

1536
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:13,200
in addition to imparting it so it's not

1537
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,760
just about the speaker

1538
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,118
freedom of expression is also about

1539
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,520
about the audience

1540
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:21,040
and you know i don't want to overstate

1541
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,480
this because like as you mentioned at

1542
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,880
the beginning

1543
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,920
you know you were wary of regulation at

1544
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:29,280
the outset and i'm

1545
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:31,760
very wary of regulation around

1546
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:33,680
disinformation in particular because

1547
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:34,640
it's often used by authoritarian

1548
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,960
governments

1549
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:38,720
to shut down independent journalism you

1550
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:41,280
know false information

1551
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,959
uh prosecutions and so forth that we've

1552
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:44,559
seen around the world

1553
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,200
but i think it's important for the

1554
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:48,160
companies to conceptualize freedom of

1555
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:51,520
expression

1556
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,680
not just as the right to post but also

1557
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:54,799
to conceptualize it as an understanding

1558
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,960
of what it

1559
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:58,400
is that individuals are capable of

1560
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,799
receiving and

1561
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,920
disinformation on the platforms as

1562
00:57:00,799 --> 00:57:03,680
you've described it

1563
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:05,040
you know in the context of you know

1564
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:07,598
manipulated consent

1565
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:08,480
trolling which the companies i think at

1566
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,720
the working level

1567
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,319
understand is a problem that they have

1568
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:12,799
to deal with and we see this in

1569
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:15,200
different

1570
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:16,480
different ways but freedom of expression

1571
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,200
also involves

1572
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,720
our right of access to information and

1573
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,118
the kind of trolling

1574
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:24,240
the kind of intimidation the kind of

1575
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:25,760
disinformation

1576
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,520
that we've been talking about and that

1577
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,520
we see regularly

1578
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,880
is a form of interference with the

1579
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:33,359
freedom of expression

1580
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,480
that we all enjoy and i think that that

1581
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:36,960
conceptualization

1582
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,400
is really critical to understanding what

1583
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,799
it is that companies should do to

1584
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,200
address it and that goes to

1585
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:44,160
you know disinformation around elections

1586
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,879
disinformation

1587
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:48,160
around candidates and and so forth and

1588
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,760
the companies

1589
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:53,598
just need to be devoting a huge amount

1590
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:57,280
of resources to that

1591
00:57:53,599 --> 00:57:59,599
to the transparency of of advertising

1592
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:00,559
that's political to all sorts of other

1593
00:57:59,599 --> 00:58:03,680
issues that give us

1594
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,799
insight to who is behind

1595
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:09,520
certain kinds of content that really

1596
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:10,720
involves disinformation and is not about

1597
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:14,480
kind of promoting

1598
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,319
the you know public square public debate

1599
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:18,079
uh and access to information i think

1600
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:21,359
that's really important for us to

1601
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:22,400
to wrap our heads around i think it's

1602
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:25,040
also clear

1603
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:26,640
you know the the rules that we live by

1604
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:29,040
in the real world

1605
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,759
uh you know what they can also they

1606
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:32,640
should work

1607
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:33,680
online in many ways when you attack

1608
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:35,040
somebody

1609
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,359
a lot of the things that you talked

1610
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:40,319
about in some ways

1611
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:42,400
are still looking at content moderation

1612
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:43,680
i'm now a fan of regulation

1613
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,839
because i think it's the only thing

1614
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,200
that's that can do something but

1615
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:51,599
not necessarily content right um

1616
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,720
we are running out we have two minutes

1617
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,920
left and i guess

1618
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:56,399
you know i i i you've had it to me a

1619
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,599
great

1620
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:00,799
mandate over a transformational period

1621
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,079
of time

1622
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:07,440
uh let me give you your closing

1623
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,359
thoughts and uh you know as as you move

1624
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:10,960
on you're still going to be with us of

1625
00:59:09,359 --> 00:59:12,640
course and we're looking forward to

1626
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:14,640
still working together but i guess

1627
00:59:12,640 --> 00:59:16,000
you know how do you how do you think of

1628
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,640
it on the last day

1629
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:19,920
what things have you have worked and

1630
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,960
things do we need to work

1631
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:28,400
on yeah i mean it's it's hard to

1632
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,440
to summarize in just a minute or two but

1633
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:34,799
i think a key issue

1634
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,839
um is almost more of a tactic it's not a

1635
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:38,319
strategy

1636
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:39,599
but the promotion of freedom of opinion

1637
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:42,720
and expression

1638
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:43,920
is a group effort you know it's not it's

1639
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:47,520
not really

1640
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,079
it's not uh within my power

1641
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:51,839
or any special rapporteur's power i mean

1642
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,760
even to say we have power

1643
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:55,520
is a bit of a joke because we don't have

1644
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:58,640
power necessarily

1645
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:59,119
but i think that we have the ability to

1646
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,319
serve

1647
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:02,640
as a platform for voices that are often

1648
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:06,240
not

1649
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:09,279
heard to serve as a platform

1650
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,680
for ensuring that these issues which are

1651
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,079
not

1652
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:14,240
just national issues you know these are

1653
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:15,680
global issues that we're talking about

1654
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:18,078
and they require

1655
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:19,279
a kind of you know not strict

1656
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:22,079
consistency

1657
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:24,640
but they do require certainly for the

1658
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:27,680
companies a global approach

1659
01:00:24,640 --> 01:00:30,640
and and i think that you know as a as a

1660
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:31,680
tactic it is essential to continue to

1661
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:33,598
involve

1662
01:00:31,680 --> 01:00:35,359
civil society in all of these

1663
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,599
discussions and and i guess my

1664
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:39,119
fundamental plea to governments

1665
01:00:37,599 --> 01:00:40,160
particularly those at the human rights

1666
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:43,520
council

1667
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:46,399
is that those governments create

1668
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:47,359
space for civil society to participate

1669
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:50,000
that they create

1670
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:50,799
space for independent media that they

1671
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:53,680
approach

1672
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,319
regulation not from the perspective of

1673
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:57,279
content

1674
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:59,040
only but from the perspective of you

1675
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,920
know how we ensure that people have

1676
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:02,720
adequate information to make decisions

1677
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,240
about

1678
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:06,240
the future of digital space

1679
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:13,040
i no thank you agree with all of it all

1680
01:01:11,440 --> 01:01:13,760
of your insights i mean i'm and i'm

1681
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:17,119
gonna quote

1682
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:19,760
um quinn mckee from article 19 when she

1683
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,799
described your intellectual fierceness i

1684
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:24,160
like that phrase

1685
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:26,319
um uh we are at the

1686
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:28,480
at the end of our time david thank you

1687
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:30,799
so much and thank you for the privilege

1688
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:33,760
of having this conversation with you

1689
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:34,880
at the end on your last day as uh on

1690
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:37,520
