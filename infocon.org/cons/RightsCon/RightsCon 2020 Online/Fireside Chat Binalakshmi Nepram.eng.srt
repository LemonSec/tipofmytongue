are in asia now given this region size

21
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,199
it is no wonder that the cultures

and the number continues to grow and it

29
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,680
is important to mention this

30
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,360
because being in the internet and the

31
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
break next speed by which

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,759
technology is developing are impacting

33
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,399
on people's rights

36
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,399
social and cultural rights we have seen

37
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,199
how being connected

38
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:49,759
has increased people's participation

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:51,680
allowed many including the marginalized

40
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,079
to be seen and to have their voices

41
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,119
heard and contributed to the creation of

42
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,360
new jobs and

43
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,600
livelihood but at the same time

44
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,640
technology is increasing the risks that

45
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,280
people face

46
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:04,719
we have digital attacks identity theft

47
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,399
and the like

48
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,560
and sideways by side with the

49
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,360
development of the internet we have also

50
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:11,440
witnessed

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,280
the rise of populist authoritarian

52
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,280
states including

53
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,879
in asia democracy is under pressure

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,080
globally

55
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,920
civic space is under attack

56
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,920
repressive laws are spreading with

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,480
increased restrictions and freedoms to

58
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,920
express

59
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,920
participate assemble and associate

60
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,319
and while new technologies have helped

61
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,319
civil society networks to grow

62
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:38,399
technologies are also being used by

63
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,399
governments to control civil society

64
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,760
movements and media freedoms

65
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,280
often under the guise of security so in

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,760

67
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,480

the digital revolution and divide has

144
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,919
sort of

145
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,000

152
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:00,560
in this digital world and what the

153
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,199
united nations and many of us

154
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,919

00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,280
are my

156
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:09,919
recommendations as lisa said

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,479
asia is home to more than 60 percent of

158
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:14,719
the world's population

159
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,400
and it has more than so there is one of

160
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,880
the largest and most popular

161
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:21,359
populated continent in the world but

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,479
then asia where we are from

163
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,160
is also a place where boy child is

164
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,479
preferred than girls

165
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,280
we have female infanticide we have honor

166
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:31,199
killings

167
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,400
we're brave and acid throwing bright

168
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,560
burning in 2000

169
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,159
female fetuses are killed in a mother's

170
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,680
womb even before they are born

171
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,919
every single day in india and according

172
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,039

00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,160
in this continent so this is just to

176
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,639
share

177
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
what is happening in terms of human

178
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:59,440
rights situation

179
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,440
in this part of the world

180
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,159
you know india and asia is a land which

181
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,599
gave yoga non-violence

182
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,520
spiritualism so there's a lot of

183
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:09,280
positive things we have 20 world

184
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,840
heritage sites here

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,960
but in this continent we have one in two

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,479
girls are married off

187
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,960
before the age of 18 and more than 68

188
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,400
women in asia have faced experienced

189
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,919
physical and sexual

190
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,960
violence in pakistan couple of years ago

191
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,440
460 reported cases of honor killing

192
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,280
and in the past couple of years women's

193
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:34,240
labor force and participation

194
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,520
has tremendously fallen in south asia

195
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:41,520
which is really really a shame

196
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,880
in this context what is the situation of

197
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:45,520
indigenous people i

198
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,759
am a person who is indigenous person

199
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,840
from manipur in northeast of india

200
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,000
so what is the situation of indigenous

201
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,919
people and for right scon

202
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,440
uh it is really important to bring the

203
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,878
voices of

204
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,039
of all of us here asia

205
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,800
uh is home to two by third of the

206
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:05,599
world's indigenous people

207
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,360
we have over 380 plus million indigenous

208
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,840
people across the world

209
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,360
and 260 of them are in asia where i'm

210
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
speaking from

211
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,879
and but what is interesting is

212
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,960
two of the biggest worlds nations india

213
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:21,759
and china

214
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,000
have not recognized existence of

215
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,000
indigenous people

216
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,319
china for example does not recognize the

217
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,479
term indigenous people

218
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,919
and so and and what happened in asia

219
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:34,240
today is

220
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,838
that it the different terms given are

221
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,880
ethnic minorities

222
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,039
hill tribes tribal people native people

223
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:42,880
that's the way people call us

224
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:44,480
many of them refer to indigenous people

225
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,439
in asia as inferior

226
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,880
for example in india indigenous people

227
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,600
from northeast are given the term

228
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:53,360
chinkies

229
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,920
chow mean momos and during covet 19

230
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,720
indigenous people have faced so much of

231
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,800
racism

232
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:02,240
that our network noted 200 cases of

233
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,399
racial violence

234
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,760
against indigenous people of northeast

235
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
india

236
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,880
where people have been asked to leave

237
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,000
their homes

238
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,600
stop from entering grocery stores and

239
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:17,519
spat upon in india's metropolitan cities

240
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:20,160
and asked to go back to china

241
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,839
because we the indigenous people look

242
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,719
like chinese or people with chinese

243
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:26,640
features so

244
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,519
there's a deep-seated issue of racism

245
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,519
against indigenous people in asia so

246
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,120
this is something that i really want

247
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:38,320
our audience uh to hear about so

248
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,200
for me personally as a woman and then on

249
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,640
top of that as an

250
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:44,480
indigenous woman what are we doing about

251
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,680
it and what is it that we are feeling

252
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:50,320
living in this kind of situation

253
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:52,560
so i would like to share that the story

254
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,959
of indigenous people and women in asia

255
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,479
is not just one of sadness

256
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,680
we have created a story of resistance

257
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,480
and resilience and i will demonstrate

258
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,519
how

259
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,240
as i mentioned i was born in manipur

260
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:10,079
a former asiatic nation state which

261
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,760
merged with india under duress

262
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:14,719
in the year 1949 and since that time

263
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,800
because of this

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,000
the way in which money for joining india

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,680
was under duress

266
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,240
there was a political conflict which

267
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:25,120
emerged and so too in the neighboring

268
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:27,200
states of uh you know nagaland um you

269
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,079

270
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,440
there were conflict which came about as

271
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,000
a result

272
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
uh you know more than for more than 70

273
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,200
years there's a

274
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:39,439
conflict going on in the northeast of

275
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,600
india which borders myanmar

276
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,000
this is home and area that i come from

277
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:46,160
is home to

278
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:49,920
272 beautiful indigenous communities

279
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:53,360
speaking more than 400 languages

280
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,959
and in this part of india if you think

281
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:58,480
india land of yoga

282
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,880
in the land of gandhi think twice

283
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:03,440
in this part of india we have a

284
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:05,120
draconian martial local the armed forces

285
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,399
specialist powers act

286
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,279
claimed in this indigenous area since

287
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:12,800
1958

288
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:15,519
we have more than 350 military stations

289
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,079
and a lot of population engineering and

290
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:18,800
and

291
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:20,719
women trafficking of indigenous people

292
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:23,040
being sold into sexual slavery and

293
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,800
exploitation has been going on

294
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:27,279
so in this part of india that i come

295
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,319
from more than 50 000 people have been

296
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,720
killed

297
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,800
and in my home state of manipur 20 000

298
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,240
women have been widowed because of this

299
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,640
conflict

300
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,480
now what did the indigenous women of

301
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:41,519
northeast india do in this part of

302
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,279
the world we have an extraordinary

303
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
women's movement

304
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,920
we had our grandmothers and mother's

305
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,120
generation in the 1904 in 1939 we have a

306
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,800
historic

307
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:57,200
women's war of nupilal where women

308
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,560
protested non-violently against british

309
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,839
colonial rule

310
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
and and their exploitative policies

311
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,800
and when armed insurgencies started

312
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:10,719
coming then indigenous women of manipur

313
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:13,040
got together and formed myra means

314
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
with bamboo torches and started

315
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,800
patrolling the streets of manipur at

316
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
night with bamboo torches

317
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,839
so that they can protect our indigenous

318
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,399
women

319
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:24,480
men and youth for from being taken away

320
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,959

321
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:28,720

extrajudicial killing in this part of

323
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,800

324
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:35,040

it is in my region northeast of india

345
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,800
seen

346
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:19,760
more than 19 internet shutdowns this is

347
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:23,120
the highest

348
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,720
in india and and as a result the freedom

349
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,320
of speech and expression has been

350
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,959
constantly curtailed so

351
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:29,600
for us imagine think for a moment an

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,479
area as

353
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,079
militarized as india's northeast already

354
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,920
with a martial law

355
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,880
on top of that you have an internet

356
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,399
shutdown for us here in covit 19 the

357
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,439
lockdowns that we have seen

358
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:44,240
we have seen lockdowns all my life of

359
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,560
100 days

360
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,639
couldn't go to school nobody could move

361
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,279
out of the house so

362
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,000
this is currently happening so many

363
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,639
journalists

364
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,320
in manipur arrested and detained at the

365
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,600
national security law

366
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:02,959
for posting critiques criticism of

367
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,480
the bjp government on facebook post

368
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:08,719
so as a result freedom of expression

369
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:10,560
absent in the indigenous areas of

370
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,199
manipur and northeast india where i come

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,359
from

372
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,240
because of martial law internet

373
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:18,560
lockdowns

374
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:21,120
and now compounded with covet 19.

375
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,959
so um this is what's happening and i'll

376
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
take you a little bit about the larger

377
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,319
context

378
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:28,480
of india where northeast of india falls

379
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,199
apart it is a part of

380
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:32,959
india is home to the second largest

381
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,959
internet user base

382
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,638
but then and then a lot of id people

383
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,359
come from india they work in united

384
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:39,279
states

385
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,959
they're working around the world i.t is

386
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,320
synonymous to india

387
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:47,119
uh professionals too but guess what

388
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,040
india's digital sprint is living

389
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,880
millions behind

390
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
and so for every one indian who has

391
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,000
access to internet there's

392
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:55,439
another indian who does not have

393
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,720
internet mostly

394
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:02,160
living in the rural areas so this is

395
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:05,519
the issue and india the world's

396
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,639
largest democracy since the coming of

397
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,440
prime minister modi do power has seen

398
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,839
internet suspended guess what how many

399
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,839
times

400
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:22,639
269 i repeat 269 times

401
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:25,920
internet shutdown in india since 2015.

402
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,560
80 of all internet clampdowns in south

403
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,680
asia

404
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,599
is in india and unesco

405
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
uh you know sort of did a calculation

406
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:36,240
and said the loss that

407
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,720
india has faced economically due to the

408
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,120
internet shutdown is close to 3 billion

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,600
us dollars

410
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,279
and some of the sessions this morning

411
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:48,480
also spoke about internet

412
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,480
shutdowns in the world and in india

413
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,959
the government can direct telecom

414
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,000
companies to shut down services

415
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,239
so that's why in kashmir we had more

416
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,320
than 200 days of internet shutdown

417
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,519
and as i mentioned more than 19 times

418
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:03,440
internet shutdown

419
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:06,480
in the indigenous areas of northeast of

420
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,480
india where i come from

421
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:11,920
now what is the situation of women in

422
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:14,560
this digital india

423
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,439
i would like to say digital india is no

424
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:20,560
country for women

425
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,120
so in india we have uh uh you know it's

426
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,959
it's as

427
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:25,360
as a woman in india as indigenous women

428
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:26,638
in india where there are so many things

429
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,240
which have improved at the same time

430
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,440
there are so many challenges

431
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:34,000
that we face india

432
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,600
has more than a hundred thousand pending

433
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:38,240
rape cases

434
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,959
we cannot go in a public transport after

435
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:43,120
say 8 30 or 9 at night

436
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,680
women in india pay taxes but then we

437
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,440
cannot use the public transport

438
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:50,479
after a certain time because we'll be

439
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,680
labeled as you are asking for violence

440
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:54,880
if you are going out

441
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:56,880
in a public space so in such a country

442
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,279
what is the situation of women and in

443
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,720
the digital world here

444
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,759
while 43 of men own a cell phone in

445
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,520
india

446
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,599
only 28 percent women or cent phones in

447
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,839
this country

448
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:13,918
and as a result what is happening is

449
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,799
there are extreme patriarchal attitudes

450
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,839
and beliefs in

451
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,918
india which has resulted for example in

452
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,039
mathura in a village a panchayat in

453
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:24,079
madura

454
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,199
announced that girls using if girls use

455
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:26,799
mobile phones

456
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,720
outside their homes they could be fined

457
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,039
two thousand one hundred indian rupees

458
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:32,960
which is about twenty eight dollars so

459
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,760
cup and giants and other conservative

460
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,679
groups

461
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,200
ban women and girls they think that if

462
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,520
women use mobile phone

463
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,320
they are morally loose they will start

464
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,918
dating

465
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:44,240
so they said they will control the

466
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,880
sexuality of indian women and girls

467
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,919
so this is and by stopping them from

468
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,679
getting access

469
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:54,240
to mobile phones and other forms of data

470
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:55,039
so this is i'm just describing what's

471
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,880
happening

472
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,480
more in my new detail about in my

473
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:00,720
country but

474
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,799
let's see let's take a moment and come

475
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,840
back to where are we

476
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,360
we all welcome the digital revolution in

477
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,120
every part of the world when it happened

478
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:12,080
in the 20th century

479
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,199
it ushered the age of information age

480
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:15,918
and currently

481
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
59 percent of the world's population has

482
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,280
access to internet

483
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:23,360
but guess what this has a huge digital

484
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,520
divide

485
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,439
between the global north and the global

486
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:30,480
south for example

487
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:32,080
in the global north 87 percent people

488
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:34,720
use internet

489
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:35,840
and how much of that in global south in

490
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,760
developing countries

491
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:42,559
only 47 47

492
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:44,320
versus 87 percent in developing worlds

493
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,879
in pakistan for instance

494
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:49,039
only 22 percent have access to internet

495
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:52,480
whereas in bangladesh 41

496
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:54,240
has access to internet so the digital

497
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:56,720
device is so huge

498
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:59,280
men in urban residents young people are

499
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:02,559
more likely to be online than women

500
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,160
rural dwellers indigenous people older

501
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,240
the marginalized and many other

502
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,400
communities so this is

503
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:09,760
what we stand around the world in terms

504
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,640
of where are we with this

505
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:15,039
information age and the digital divide

506
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:17,919
and the united nations actually shared

507
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:19,520
that if you want to attain and poverty

508
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,200
in the world by 2030

509
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,559
which is called sustainable development

510
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,720
goals then

511
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:25,600
we should be able to address that

512
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,480
everyone

513
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,439
is able to access and use the internet

514
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:33,919
till now in 2020 as we speak right now

515
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:36,160
that's not the case and particularly i

516
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,200
would like to note that in today's world

517
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,720
90 of the jobs worldwide do require a

518
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:43,200
digital component

519
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:45,039
and someone once told me that vina if

520
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,679
you don't exist on internet into this

521
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,919
world

522
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:50,960
we don't exist at all such is the

523
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:52,559
importance of the digital world

524
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,559
let's see what's the gender divide i

525
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,399
just shared with you the digital divide

526
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,879
between the developed and the developing

527
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,200
like

528
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,720
between the north and south divide what

529
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,520
about gender

530
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:04,720
women form half the world's population

531
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,400
don't we

532
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,200
but we only only 48 women have access to

533
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,200
internet

534
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,600
compared to how much percent of women of

535
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,960
men 58

536
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,199
and worldwide uh you know

537
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:21,360
software is a hugely male dominated

538
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
worlds only 15 percent

539
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,399
female software authors can be found

540
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,520
worldwide

541
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,360
so this is the kind of divide that we

542
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,039
are seeing both in terms of

543
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,039
region as well as in gender

544
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
now coming to what's happening with

545
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,918
indigenous people

546
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:42,320
and uh this digital world what is it

547
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
happening

548
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,240
15 of the world's poor are indigenous

549
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,559
people

550
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,120
as i mentioned 15 of the world's poor

551
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:53,600
are indigenous people

552
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,280
and as a result as i describe what's

553
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,320
happening in manipur in northeast of

554
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:59,600
india

555
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:01,360
parts of the places where northeast of

556
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,879
indigenous people live are highly

557
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:06,879
colonized

558
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:10,000
militarized weaponized women trafficked

559
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,480
our children forced into labor so much

560
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,679
of

561
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:15,440
these exploitation going on so imagine

562
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,960
and in many parts of manipur where i

563
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,799
come from forget

564
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
access to internet we don't even have

565
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,918
electricity

566
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,679
we don't even have roads so this is the

567
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,640
half the world that we are still here to

568
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,559
reach

569
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:31,120
so indigenous people have been actually

570
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:32,960
left out in many parts of the world

571
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,120
out from the indigent of this digital

572
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,640
world while many of us are connected

573
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,360
during covet lockdown

574
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,240
through internet i also feel my heart

575
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,600
goes out

576
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,400
to million others who don't even have

577
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,240
forget internet electricity not have

578
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,080
never right to the life forget about

579
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:52,799
freedom of expression

580
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:54,799
so on the other hand indigenous people

581
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:58,080
are also concerned like many other

582
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,600
communities in the world of what is to

583
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,480
be done with the transmission and

584
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,959
protection of the

585
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,039
industrial knowledge because as we know

586
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,320
since the beginning of the great scone

587
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:08,640
we've been discussing

588
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:09,600
what are the laws and regulations that

589
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,679
nations have to do

590
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,799
un has to do to protect because there's

591
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,679
still no

592
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,840
no protection till now on our data so

593
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,799
indigenous people are wary

594
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:23,280
that the digital world is an extension

595
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:25,360
might be a part of a colonization

596
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,639
process there's no protection of

597
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:28,559
traditional knowledge

598
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:30,799
what about intellectual property rights

599
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:32,720
what about collective guardianship

600
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:34,240
and about compromising communities so

601
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:37,679
these are the different concerns

602
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,679
that indigenous people have

603
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,159
again take a moment to say the whole

604
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,880
digital world

605
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,559
is as i mentioned deeply deeply divided

606
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,559
as i have just shared in the last couple

607
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:50,399
of minutes

608
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,158
the other aspect that i would really

609
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,360
like to touch upon is

610
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:56,799
in today's world digital world human

611
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,600
rights defenders

612
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:02,240
last year 300 human rights defenders

613
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:05,120
were killed in 2019

614
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,799
out of which just in latin america

615
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,879
american countries alone

616
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:10,000
28 of them indigenous people were

617
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,120
murdered

618
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:14,000
for defending your rights my rights the

619
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,559
rights of

620
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,080
all of us to stay in safe environments

621
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:23,678
as i mentioned women worldwide have

622
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,240
accessed only 48

623
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,200
of women have access to internet but

624
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:30,480
guess what

625
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,000
when it comes to online harassment

626
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,799
women are likely to face 27 times more

627
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,919
harris

628
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,279
than men online

629
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:43,600
for many of us like myself we use

630
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:45,520
for example the stories in the history

631
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,360
of indigenous people of manipur is not

632
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,320
in the textbooks of india

633
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,039
we are not in the narrative in new delhi

634
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:56,879
or in washington dc or in geneva

635
00:23:53,039 --> 00:24:00,000
our history our language our way of life

636
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,640
our civilization our culture is not

637
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,279
a part of the narrative of our national

638
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,279
as well as

639
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:10,559
global narratives and as a result

640
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:12,159
uh we used social media platforms for

641
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,000
example twitter we opened twitter

642
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:16,240
account in 2019

643
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,320
and today we have half a million

644
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:21,279
followers on twitter

645
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:22,799
and in 140 words characters we were able

646
00:24:21,279 --> 00:24:25,520
to tell our story

647
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,120
but that also comes with a price over

648
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,158
twitter we have also

649
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,439
face attacks uh threats

650
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:36,080
and so much a couple of years like

651
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,720
two years ago i personally face a lot of

652
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:39,199
violence

653
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,440
on twitter where i have been called a

654
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,279
secessionist separatist for just doing

655
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:45,600
the kind of work that i described

656
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,840
ensuring democracy rule of law and

657
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,840
gender justice in my part of the world

658
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,400
and of late in in different parts of our

659
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,000
country and the world

660
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,679
governments have been targeting human

661
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,159
rights defenders they have been cyber

662
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:02,480
threats

663
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:04,960
and trolling going on which all of us

664
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,360
were tuning in today have seen

665
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:08,159
so cyber threats and a monopoly of

666
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,158
strategies

667
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,600
used by government authorities or

668
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,640
non-state bad actors

669
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:17,760
to be able websites have been censored

670
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,960
fake accounts created and so all of

671
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:23,440
these are happening

672
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,039
side by side and i'll come to personal

673
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,559
data now

674
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,039
a couple of years months ago

675
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,200
prime minister modi spoke in texas and

676
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:36,080
then he spoke about the new oil

677
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,200
of the digital age what is the new oil

678
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,399
of the digital age

679
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,360
anyone here the new oil of the digital

680
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,559
age

681
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:47,918
is the data of you and

682
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:49,918
mine personal data is the new oil of the

683
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:54,000
digital age

684
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,240
how sad it is that in 2020

685
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:58,240
so much of knowledge out there in the

686
00:25:56,240 --> 00:26:00,080
world we are connected at the

687
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:02,640
at our fingertips by just a click of a

688
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,360
button at the same time we have lost it

689
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:06,480
all

690
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:09,760
we don't have privacy anymore and these

691
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,600
personal data have been misused and

692
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:14,158
collected

693
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:15,760
the fundamental human right enshrined in

694
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:17,360
the constitution of india instead of

695
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,480
constant universal declaration human

696
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,120
rights

697
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,720
all of this have been taken away in the

698
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,639
digital sphere

699
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,840
human rights defenders have been put at

700
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,679
a heightened risk

701
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,678
because of the way our data has been

702
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:32,960
stolen attackers can

703
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:35,520
carry it take away our data and use this

704
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,039
to attack us and this is what is

705
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:40,320
happening

706
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:42,320
and as i mentioned and i really love the

707
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:43,678
campaign of access now on keep it on

708
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,918
campaign in which

709
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:46,960
it it says as countries face financial

710
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:50,720
downs

711
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:52,720
must be work ensure we remain connected

712
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,000
be able to exercise our fundamental

713
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,600
human rights

714
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,039
including the right to access

715
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,840
information and

716
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,120
express ourselves every single day

717
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,799
democracy

718
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:07,439
cannot run if our voice is silence

719
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:09,279
resistance and resilience is a part of a

720
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,240
good democracy

721
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:13,679
and shutting internet shuts our

722
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,000
decision-making power

723
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,279
and our freedom of expression and this

724
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,600
is what we got to end together

725
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:22,559
so and in terms of the gendered

726
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,760
implication of

727
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:27,600
all these challenges as i mentioned that

728
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,399
it is really important that we got to

729
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,959
involve

730
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:32,158
technology which can be a powerful tools

731
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,840
as i mentioned

732
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:35,840
for women and girls and people of other

733
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,520
gender to become activists we can use

734
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:40,158
there are good sides of technology that

735
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,879
we can also make use of

736
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:43,840
in fact as i mentioned 90 of the jobs

737
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:47,200
worldwide

738
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,399
already have a digital component and

739
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,200
if you bring 600 million girls and women

740
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,199
online

741
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,799
it could boost global gross domestic

742
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,159
product by a whopping

743
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:58,960
18 billion us dollar so when we are

744
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:02,480
arguing for

745
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:04,799
gender inclusion in the digital space

746
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,240
it is important that we are doing it to

747
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,600
be able to

748
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:12,159
all of us that we could be beneficiaries

749
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:13,678
of a global progress and not that only

750
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,799
one person of the world

751
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:18,720
owns 99 of this globe currently which is

752
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,120
happening

753
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,320
and for us the indigenous people what is

754
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,799
the way forward

755
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,720
as i mentioned indigenous people are

756
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:28,720
distinctly disadvantaged

757
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,720
with regards to digital information

758
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:33,120
excess and distribution

759
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:34,559
and a digital world can also be a

760
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:37,439
powerful tool you know

761
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:39,120
during covet 19 i was a part of many of

762
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,960
the online meetings

763
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,959
where we had discussions of indigenous

764
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,679
people and covet and how do we

765
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:48,240
safeguard ourselves but then obstacles

766
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:50,960
to connectivity remain as i mentioned

767
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:52,399
there are so many parts of the world

768
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:55,360
which are not connected by

769
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,158
roads by electricity by internet so

770
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,120
there is

771
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:00,480
all of these challenges still exist and

772
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:04,719
um

773
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:05,440
in fact uh jack panashi uh uh he's from

774
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,679
labrador

775
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,520
once said in order for our children to

776
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:11,360
participate in an equal level with

777
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:13,360
leaders of the future

778
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:16,080
they need to have the same access and

779
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,399
training with computers and the internet

780
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,639
as children of other cultures so it's

781
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,840
really really important

782
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,640
and to end with the last few words let

783
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,279
us see

784
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:29,200
you know i call united nations as our

785
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,240
grandparents if our nations are not

786
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,960
doing the right thing

787
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,080
let's go the united nations so what does

788
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:37,120
united nations do

789
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,399
and in fact for indigenous people access

790
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:42,000
to technology

791
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:44,000
as early as 200 2001 united nations

792
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:47,600
general assembly resolution 15

793
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,679
56 183 endorse a holding of a world

794
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,760
summit of information systems

795
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,600
according to this there were two

796
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:54,879
important meetings held in geneva in

797
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:58,000
2003

798
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,799
and in tunis plan of 2005.

799
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:02,880
and in this it was very clear that in

800
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:05,120
the evolution it was declared at this

801
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:06,720
forums that the evolution of an

802
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,719
information society

803
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:10,559
particular attention must be given to

804
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,279
the special situation of indigenous

805
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,600
people

806
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,480
as well as the preservation of the our

807
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:18,080
heritage

808
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,840
and our cultural legacy and then uh

809
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,678
following these two important meetings

810
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,158
that's why the importance

811
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:25,760
when we build resistance and resilience

812
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:29,039
global solidarity is an

813
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:31,520
absolute must and so civil society

814
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,240
coming together indigenous people came

815
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:36,279
together for the first global forum

816
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,840
and the information society in the year

817
00:30:36,279 --> 00:30:41,039
2003.

818
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:41,600
so this was uh you know supported by the

819
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,360
government

820
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:45,360
canada and others united nations

821
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:48,639
permanent forum and indigenous people

822
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,719
was a part of and so as a result

823
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,799
they had a adoption of the geneva

824
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,960
declaration of the global forum

825
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,080
of indigenous people and information

826
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,000
society

827
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,120
so really kudos to the indigenous people

828
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,159
who formed

829
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,080
and then an international indigenous ict

830
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:07,120
task force was formed

831
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,559
so it continues to pursue the mandate of

832
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:13,760
ensuring inclusion in the digital age

833
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:16,320
so my final words are recommendations so

834
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,600
here we are in 2020 we're here at

835
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,519
wright's con

836
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,120
grateful to excel now for the fantastic

837
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,679
work they've been doing over the years

838
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,918
on

839
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,039
on digital uh you know human rights in

840
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:28,880
the digital world

841
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:32,158
it's so important that we got to engage

842
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:32,480
the united nations in this we need as

843
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,799
many

844
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,399
have stated before an annual digital

845
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,200
gender

846
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:40,158
equality report is needed i feel and

847
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,720
then we need

848
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,679
to foster policies and projects and

849
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:46,480
approaches

850
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:48,799
to this digital which are developed by

851
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,000
including women and indigenous people

852
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,240
do not speak for us about us without

853
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,840
us we've got to involve indigenous

854
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:57,600
people find out where the indigenous

855
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:00,080
people in our countries

856
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,279
do not make us as tokens in your

857
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,320
decision making

858
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:06,799
when you make digital policies

859
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,960
and we need as i mentioned to expand

860
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,200
internet and wireless technology

861
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:14,000
and nations need to have their own

862
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,240
digital set of strategy and e-strategies

863
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,519
we've got to evolve them because it's a

864
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,000
very important part as

865
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:22,480
nations adhere themselves to sustainable

866
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,480
development goals by 2030

867
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:26,000
national digital strategy is a must for

868
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,559
including and ensuring

869
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:30,480
no one is left behind and i'll end with

870
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,600
this beautiful quote

871
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,600
and this was actually unesco states

872
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,199
stated a couple of years ago in which it

873
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,639
said the rise

874
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,480
which is really important okay we are

875
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:43,120
connected by uh

876
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:45,760
you know a click of a button uh we are

877
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,120
having this global conference right now

878
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:52,640
but let us not you know sort of

879
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,120
confuse that as unesco said

880
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,080
the rise of a global information society

881
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,199
must not

882
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,879
overshadow the fact that it is valuable

883
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:03,440
only as a means

884
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,080
so global information society is a means

885
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:06,960
to achieve

886
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,559
genuine knowledge societies in other

887
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,200
words

888
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:12,320
information communication technology are

889
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,640
recognized

890
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,360
we recognize as knowledge generating

891
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,760
tools

892
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,600
but i repeat they should not constitute

893
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,279
knowledge itself

894
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,360
and i end with the words wise words of

895
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:28,080
chief george shirley of the navajo

896
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:31,760
nation state in which he said

897
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,120
information is not wisdom information is

898
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:36,000
without value

899
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:38,158
is without value if it is not available

900
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:40,240
to those who need it

901
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:41,279
knowledge combined with the wisdom of

902
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,559
our peoples

903
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,840
is what creates true opportunity

904
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,320
this is what we call upon nation states

905
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:52,399
the united nations and the global civil

906
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,158
society and the global digital world

907
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,760
to include the voices of women and

908
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,519
indigenous people

909
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,640
thank you so much and thank you so much

910
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,000
for giving this platform

911
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:09,280
and for listening to us thank you

912
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:11,359
you very much bina for that

913
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,399
wonderful keynote message that you

914
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:15,918
delivered

915
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,440
uh that was actually a lot of issues

916
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:22,000
for us to chew um and i think the

917
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:23,359
the issues that the two mentioned

918
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,320
they're happening that

919
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:28,480
they're happening not just in um your

920
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,200
part of the world not just in manipur

921
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,119
but also in other parts of asia in other

922
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:36,000
parts of the world

923
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:36,480
and it was quite disheartening to note

924
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,760
that

925
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,760
the situation of uh indigenous peoples

926
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:45,679
not just in your part of the world but

927
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:48,240
also in other parts of asia

928
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:50,639
the discrimination the depression the

929
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,959
trafficking that's going on

930
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,200
yeah and the status of women we really

931
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,599
have to do something about it

932
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:59,520
because as we know um whenever there are

933
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,760
conflicts in conflict situation

934
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,720
even in emergencies such as the kovind

935
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,560
pandemic

936
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:07,319
it is always the women who bear the

937
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:08,880
grant the women who bear the

938
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:11,200
consequences

939
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:13,040
and who has to the women who have to

940
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,640
take case when something

941
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:20,240
happens when tragedy starts and yet um

942
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:23,598
in many parts of the yeah the

943
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:27,118
internet being connected is very much um

944
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:30,320
helpful and that you also mentioned that

945
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,359
um in many parts of the world

946
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:34,480
uh there's still a digital divide that

947
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:37,680
exists

948
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,320
uh and and this is very stark when when

949
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,560
you

950
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:42,560
zero in on the sector of women and

951
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:46,720
indigenous peoples

952
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:50,078
so um bina um

953
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
uh maybe why why should we include why

954
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:54,000
is it

955
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:55,520
important that uh women especially the

956
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:58,560
marginalized ones

957
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,480
indigenous peoples why should they be

958
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:04,560
uh included uh when when

959
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,760
uh why should they have access why

960
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,279
should they be

961
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:12,640
included in in the internet

962
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,240
and um uh

963
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,720
how can we how can technology be used

964
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:21,118
how can this access be used to empower

965
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,160
women

966
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,560
yes um actually my the question would be

967
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,598
why shouldn't we be included

968
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:32,799
as i mentioned that women

969
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,000
form 50 of the world's population

970
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:38,880
half the world's population but only 48

971
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,680
women have access to internet uh excess

972
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,520
and

973
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,520
and even in countries as i mentioned in

974
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,240
india only 28

975
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,560
women have access to the internet uh so

976
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:49,598
this

977
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,720
is really and whether it's about

978
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,400
um in the economy as i mentioned uh

979
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,879
if you boost economy or even in

980
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,760
democracy working of a democracy

981
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:01,119
uh if you exclude the women and the

982
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,160
marginalized

983
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:05,200
and other minority communities uh you

984
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:08,640
cannot

985
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:10,640
say that we are truly having uh you know

986
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,960
the deepening of our democracies in

987
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,160
various asiatic nation states

988
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,599
what is really tragic in asia today is

989
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,839
this a rise

990
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,000
democracy is a backsliding of democracy

991
00:37:20,839 --> 00:37:24,640
happening

992
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,920
all around the world and including asian

993
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,359
nation states

994
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,960
there's a rise of religious

995
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,279
fundamentalism

996
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,440
religious conversion happening in many

997
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,079
parts of south asia and pakistan

998
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,200
in india and other parts where there is

999
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,839
fundamental

1000
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:41,680
uh ways of using religion as a means to

1001
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,720
build nationalism

1002
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,759
that's why in in india

1003
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:48,560
uh you know we a lot of internet

1004
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:51,599
shutdowns

1005
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,480
happen during the time of the protests

1006
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:56,640
against

1007
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:59,359
the citizenship you know amendment act

1008
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,078
and what does this act says and as well

1009
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,839
as a national register of citizens

1010
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,000
these were two really uh discriminatory

1011
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:10,720
policies which was brought about

1012
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,040
by the modi government in which under

1013
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:14,959
the national register of citizens

1014
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,040
it was said that you have to show

1015
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:18,640
documents to prove that you're an indian

1016
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:20,960
citizen

1017
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:22,720
and it was this exercise was done the

1018
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,880
past couple of years

1019
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,799
so imagine think for a moment today

1020
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,400
whichever country you're watching this

1021
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:32,240
right scorn fire chat from if today even

1022
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,800
if you're in a passport

1023
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:36,799
you have your identity cards yet the

1024
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,000
government of your country comes and

1025
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,480
tells you

1026
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,680
proof that you have ancestry records

1027
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:46,240
from 1971 or 1950s

1028
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:46,799
prove that you you and your ancestors

1029
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,598
voted

1030
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:51,839
in the last 30 years in this country and

1031
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:53,760
if you do not have documents to prove

1032
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:56,880
that you can vote

1033
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,160
then you are called registered as a

1034
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,359
foreigner in your own

1035
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,799
country this is what happened in assam

1036
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:07,598
in northeast of india in which 2 million

1037
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:09,440
people were left out of the national

1038
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:12,400
register of citizens

1039
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:13,440
and we did an analysis of who were left

1040
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,280
out of it

1041
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,599
and we found out that 69

1042
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,280
of the people left out from the national

1043
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,520
register of citizens

1044
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:28,640
in india where women i repeat 69

1045
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,359
because in asia in south asia women

1046
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:32,160
are the properties of their fathers of

1047
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,560
their brothers

1048
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,520
or their husbands or some male member of

1049
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:38,480
a family

1050
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:40,400
this is a patriarchy which we live in

1051
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,280
and as a result when a woman gets

1052
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,280
married

1053
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,640
then except for her name and the clothes

1054
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,520
she wear there's nothing that

1055
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,440
she can call her own forget documents

1056
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,839
forget documents

1057
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:57,200
so as a result um in this uh

1058
00:39:53,839 --> 00:40:00,560
in the human rights in the digital world

1059
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,560
if we do not include the voices of women

1060
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,759
and indigenous people

1061
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,880
then we are not we cannot say we are

1062
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,839
living in

1063
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,800
global democracies if you exclude half

1064
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,640
the women

1065
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,400
if you include the marginalized the

1066
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,799
lgbtq communities you

1067
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:19,920
exclude the minorities the dalits we

1068
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,720
cannot say this is a true democracy so

1069
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:24,560
inclusion of gender and minorities

1070
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:27,118
indigenous people is a must

1071
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,799
in strengthening democracies and the

1072
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:31,599
digital world can help

1073
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:33,200
you can help how how long does it take

1074
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,680
to get electricity to

1075
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:37,520
mountain regions in manipur or in

1076
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,799
tripura i have visited all these

1077
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:41,440
mountain regions

1078
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,720
in the last many many years i've been to

1079
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,319
many of these points

1080
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:47,279
but they have been totally totally

1081
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:50,160
excluded inclusion

1082
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:50,960
a diversity policy in the digital sphere

1083
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,279
as well as in

1084
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:55,359
every sphere of social economic

1085
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,000
inclusion is what we are asking through

1086
00:40:55,359 --> 00:40:58,000
this platform

1087
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,880
yes thank you vina um great to hear that

1088
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:06,800
you mentioned about the id

1089
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:09,040
because um a lot of countries are

1090
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,880
looking up to the adhar system in india

1091
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:12,240
even the philippines has its own

1092
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,119
national id

1093
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,839
and it is great to hear that there are

1094
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:18,960
challenges

1095
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,279
there which we have to look into

1096
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,800
before embarking on issues such as

1097
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:28,240
already using digital id and profiling

1098
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,040
now you also mentioned about um internet

1099
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:32,000
shutdowns

1100
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,800
we know that internet shutdowns are

1101
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,119
being used

1102
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:36,000
to silence descent as you mentioned

1103
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:38,400
access now

1104
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:40,079
is monitoring these shutdowns under the

1105
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:42,720
keep it on campaign

1106
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:45,119
they happen most of the time during

1107
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:47,680
conflict situations

1108
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:48,480
and of course india taps the list of

1109
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:51,919
internet

1110
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,079
shutdowns and then also in some targeted

1111
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,000
areas they happen for instance in

1112
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,520
bangladesh in the camps where

1113
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:02,560
the rohingya refugees reside

1114
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,560
in the uh rakhine

1115
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,560
and chin states in myanmar where there's

1116
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,400
military where the military is in

1117
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:10,400
conflict with some armed routes

1118
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,520
in indonesia as well they there was

1119
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,520
internet shutdown

1120
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,560
in an attempt to disconnect the people

1121
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,200
of papua

1122
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,759
new governments would say that they do

1123
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,160
this

1124
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:20,960
uh they justify internet shutdowns by

1125
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,240
saying that

1126
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:27,680
uh this is in order to fight fake news

1127
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:29,839
which is yeah uh hate speech

1128
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:32,799
a lot of hate speech happening and also

1129
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:32,799
um to

1130
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:40,160
to so that violence can be um

1131
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:41,280
uh curbed that uh governments are also

1132
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:44,160
saying that this is

1133
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:44,960
a uh precautionary measure for public

1134
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,319
security

1135
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,400
national security so do you think that

1136
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:51,599
in a way governments are also justified

1137
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,680
when they say this

1138
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:56,720
and why should we keep the internet on

1139
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:59,680
especially for women

1140
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:01,839
yes uh lisa this is really something

1141
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,960
which has been troubling all of us

1142
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,560
so imagine freedom of expression is the

1143
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:08,960
phenomenal right

1144
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:12,560
enshrine in our constitutions enshrined

1145
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:15,599
in universal declaration of human rights

1146
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:17,599
you know growing up in a conflict area

1147
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,200
in manipur as a child i was

1148
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,680
always told be not don't ask questions

1149
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,720
we were always asked to keep going this

1150
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,919
was like

1151
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:31,279
15 20 years ago and today

1152
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:35,599
lisa we can't even post on facebook

1153
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,760
or on twitter in manipur

1154
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:40,079
journalists have been arrested for a

1155
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,720
facebook post

1156
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,319
we can't express freedom of expressions

1157
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:47,118
completely completely

1158
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:49,119
scuttled and as i mentioned since prime

1159
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,319
minister modi came to power india being

1160
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,680
the land of

1161
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:54,880
iit uh so many i.t professionals even

1162
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:58,078
then

1163
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,960
uh you know we had 259 internet shutdown

1164
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,960
since the year 2015.

1165
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,400
so this is a great tragedy for india as

1166
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,880
a nation state

1167
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,680
as well as many other nation states who

1168
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:13,440
think

1169
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,520
that by what are nations made of by the

1170
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:17,599
way nations are made of people like you

1171
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:19,839
and me

1172
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:23,359
you cannot you can rule and govern a

1173
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,799
nation well if we listen to each other

1174
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:30,560
we express ourselves through

1175
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:33,520
our writing our research our posting

1176
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,160
and of course into this world where a

1177
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,119
lot of

1178
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:38,799
you know as i mentioned it is not for

1179
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:42,240
people of access to troll

1180
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,119
armies who pays to do the trolling

1181
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,680
who pays to do all of these uh threats i

1182
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:49,040
mean it

1183
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,680
requires a strategy someone organized to

1184
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:51,920
do it

1185
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:53,359
and nation states have been doing it

1186
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,280
this is wrong

1187
00:44:53,359 --> 00:44:57,040
and we need to tell them squarely in the

1188
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:59,520
face that we can't

1189
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:01,040
we have a a very interesting example in

1190
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:04,400
in assam

1191
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:06,400
where the government of assam actually

1192
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,680
shut down the internet and it was the

1193
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,240
gohati high court

1194
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,440
we ensured that the internet ban is

1195
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:14,799
lifted

1196
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:16,880
so we should litigate we should work

1197
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:19,040
with lawyers we should ensure

1198
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,920
that our freedom of expression is

1199
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,800
protected

1200
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:23,920
every single day right now it's being

1201
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:27,200
taken away

1202
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,040
and in fact can you imagine the the

1203
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:30,078
beginning of the digital age which is

1204
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:35,079
the information

1205
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:38,079
age and today in 2020 we are discussing

1206
00:45:35,079 --> 00:45:41,520
disinformation from information

1207
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,640
to disinformation we have to know and

1208
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,640
ask as experts who have created this

1209
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:49,359
how did this come about who is

1210
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:52,240
responsible it is not people like me

1211
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:52,560
or people the marginalized indigenous

1212
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,720
for

1213
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:55,759
us all we are doing is to deepen

1214
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:58,799
democracy

1215
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:59,119
and share rule of law in our villages in

1216
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,560
our

1217
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:05,280
regions in our nation states and

1218
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:06,240
we are being threatened repeatedly by

1219
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,960
just doing

1220
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,118
the right thing because of what i call

1221
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:14,880
the criminalization of a democracy

1222
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:16,800
is happening and in when we discuss

1223
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:18,480
digital right human rights digital world

1224
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,400
we should also realize

1225
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,599
how important it is to look into these

1226
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,760
aspects

1227
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,760
while we do other human rights how we

1228
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,400
ensure that

1229
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,280
kleptocracies we are it's not democracy

1230
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,280
anymore it's

1231
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:34,560
kleptocracy which is now ruling the

1232
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,160
world it's a rising authority in regimes

1233
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,680
from asia to you know europe

1234
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,399
to americas so i think civil society

1235
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:46,640
as well as experts thinkers you know

1236
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,440
good people or policymakers we got to

1237
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,078
unite

1238
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:52,640
to confront this otherwise it'll keep

1239
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,640
going on

1240
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,800
yes it's sad that um even during this

1241
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:02,000
time of the pandemic

1242
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:05,040
uh even states are using um

1243
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:07,359
uh the issue of kovit 19 to repress

1244
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,279
freedom such as freedom of information

1245
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:11,359
and assembly as you mentioned

1246
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,040
and this is true for for many countries

1247
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:15,200
like my country in the philippines

1248
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:16,240
where they pass the anti-terror law

1249
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,200
there's hong kong

1250
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,919
also with the national security law and

1251
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:22,160
yeah

1252
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,040
because of this repressive laws being

1253
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,839
passed

1254
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,558
activists and critics of government uh

1255
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,440
fear that it might be used against them

1256
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:33,520
and yeah soviet 19 has really affected

1257
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:34,240
the work of human rights defenders like

1258
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:38,079
us

1259
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:41,598
so given that how can we as a

1260
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,400
civil society how can we as activists

1261
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,240
push back what resilience strategies do

1262
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:49,760
you see that we can employ

1263
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:52,319
so that we can restore the semblance of

1264
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,520
democracy that we want to see

1265
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,720
yes but this is a great question how are

1266
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:59,040
we doing resilience

1267
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:00,959
and resistance during this time of the

1268
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,599
pandemic of it 19

1269
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:04,960
and all of us everyone tuning in here

1270
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,400
every part of the world

1271
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:11,839
have been affected by kovite 19 and

1272
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:15,200
india just crossed 1.4 million and

1273
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:17,920
so what i have seen during this

1274
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,520
as i mentioned in many parts of india

1275
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:21,680
for example manipur in northeast of

1276
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:25,359
india that i come from as i mentioned

1277
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:27,279
much before this perfect lockdown we had

1278
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:28,720
so many lockdowns i've seen so many

1279
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:31,920
lockdowns in my life

1280
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:34,720
combing operations we have seen buns

1281
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:36,800
her towels and where we couldn't like

1282
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:39,118
step out of our home so

1283
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,319
we the indigenous people in northeastern

1284
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:43,839
they have seen

1285
00:48:40,319 --> 00:48:45,359
so much of lockdowns in our life before

1286
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,799
covet 19

1287
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:50,319
and now we are seeing undercover 19.

1288
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,000
and i used to joke with my friend saying

1289
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:54,319
oh my god we have seen

1290
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,160
lockdowns before so this is not new for

1291
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:59,599
us these lockdowns

1292
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,279
and what i saw during covit 19 a couple

1293
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:03,359
of trends

1294
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,440
first not just as you mentioned the

1295
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:08,960
internet lockdown

1296
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:12,400
but during covet 19

1297
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:14,960
government of india also tried to

1298
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,079
give order to build dams all across the

1299
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,440
northeast of india

1300
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:22,400
given environmental clearances

1301
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,640
in northeast of india there is a plan to

1302
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:27,200
build over 160 dams all across

1303
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:29,359
indigenous parts of northeast of india

1304
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:30,799
and during covet 19 in the middle of

1305
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:33,440
kovit 19

1306
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,160
when everyone was just trying to survive

1307
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,200
trying to stay

1308
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:40,240
safe and alive suddenly there was a

1309
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:40,879
a thing which says you know they are

1310
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,200
going to give

1311
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:45,440
the the green tribunal is given a

1312
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:47,839
go-ahead site for this dams

1313
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,880
and what was so critical was at that

1314
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:51,839
time was

1315
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:53,040
there was a whole array of resistance

1316
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:56,078
online

1317
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:58,240
by a lot of young environmentalists

1318
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,480
in india from the northeast of india as

1319
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:03,598
well as fridays of future

1320
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:06,559
who actually push back we

1321
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:07,119
took to internet we took to social media

1322
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:09,920
and

1323
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:11,760
i tried my best to amplify through my

1324
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,880
twitter and other social media accounts

1325
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:15,920
and

1326
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:18,720
and and it was temporarily stalled so

1327
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,599
this is a very beautiful example of how

1328
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,240
when the young people were

1329
00:50:20,599 --> 00:50:25,200
inter-generational we

1330
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:26,399
come together and use whatever energy we

1331
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:29,118
have

1332
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,079
to be able to push back governments must

1333
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,839
not forget

1334
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:34,400
that they are made of people like you

1335
00:50:31,839 --> 00:50:37,599
and me young and old

1336
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:38,400
uh and we uh some of us we are

1337
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:42,000
continuing to

1338
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:43,839
watch that you know nations and our

1339
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:45,040
countries are governed according to rule

1340
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:47,119
of law

1341
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:48,160
and we do not want authoritarian regimes

1342
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,920
lawlessness

1343
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,440
we don't want this information which

1344
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,920
will you know

1345
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:55,359
ensure me against my sister me against

1346
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,920
my brother

1347
00:50:55,359 --> 00:51:00,000
inter-ethnic fights through this social

1348
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:02,400
media where a lot of

1349
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,280
disinformation has been spread about

1350
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:05,680
communities

1351
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:07,520
and all of that so that was one thing

1352
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,319
not just internet shutdown during covet

1353
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:10,960
19

1354
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:12,000
there were attempts by our governments

1355
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:15,599
to push

1356
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:18,079
uh you know environmental uh you know

1357
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,839
passes to ensure that dams are built

1358
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:21,760
there was also in assam

1359
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,640
they tried to give clearance for coal

1360
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:27,680
mining during covet 19.

1361
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,879
this was a a elephant reserve which they

1362
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,319
tried to

1363
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,119
you know use it for mining exploitation

1364
00:51:32,319 --> 00:51:36,480
and because of the resilience and

1365
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:39,599
resistance

1366
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,119
by the uh by the communities uh

1367
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,720
young the all the indigenous and the

1368
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:44,160
women communities in the northeast of

1369
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,359
india it was pushed back

1370
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:48,558
all happening 19. so that is one thing

1371
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,520
and the third thing

1372
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,240
which is happening in many parts of the

1373
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,040
indigenous

1374
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:58,720
as well as in in asia during covet 19 is

1375
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:01,759
um i don't know whether it's done in

1376
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,799
philippines but today in manipur

1377
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:07,920
if you step out of the house

1378
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:09,520
during the lockdown it's not a lockdown

1379
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:12,079
it's a curfew

1380
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:13,040
so they will find you 10 000 rupees

1381
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,319
which is about

1382
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:19,279
300 if you disobey

1383
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:20,480
the lockdown order so it's literally a

1384
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,040
curfew so if you

1385
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,480
do not have a piece of paper which says

1386
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,319
you can move about

1387
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:27,839
which only the rich and the powerful

1388
00:52:26,319 --> 00:52:30,558
will have so

1389
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:31,839
many many poor marginalized people are

1390
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,720
on the total

1391
00:52:31,839 --> 00:52:36,720
lockdown in manipur as we speak i have

1392
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,439
been in touch with many many villagers

1393
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:40,480
uh in manipur during this time and this

1394
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,160
curfew

1395
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:45,200
which we saw earlier in the conflict

1396
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:47,520
areas it is about military curfew now on

1397
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:49,598
the kovit 19 is a curfew

1398
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,800
imposed by the government whether when

1399
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:54,400
the national disaster

1400
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:58,240
law has been used to put people behind

1401
00:52:54,400 --> 00:53:00,559
bars for disobeying and one of the

1402
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,439
funniest thing which happened last 20 72

1403
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:04,400
hours was

1404
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,800
a state of india i think jharkhand said

1405
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,440
that

1406
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,319
if you are found without a mast you

1407
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:09,920
would refine

1408
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:12,558
a hundred thousand indian rupees which

1409
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:16,240
is about 1 300 us dollar

1410
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:19,839
for not wearing a mask so on one hand

1411
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,240
uh the fault of the government which did

1412
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:23,040
not

1413
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:25,598
put india on a proper lockdown initially

1414
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,359
we were busy clanging pots and pans

1415
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,880
but we did not have a scientific

1416
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:32,799
approach towards

1417
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:36,400
handling kovitt 19 resulting in millions

1418
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:38,880
millions of poor migrant laborers

1419
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,400
fleeing india's metropolitan cities

1420
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:43,680
working for days

1421
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:46,079
months to reach their villages

1422
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:48,319
and so as a result huge community

1423
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:52,400
failure of the central government

1424
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:54,800
to ensure has resulted in a massive

1425
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,720
community curve transmission from

1426
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:58,480
india's metropolitan cities

1427
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:00,000
to rural areas of india which is

1428
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:02,079
happening right now so

1429
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:04,079
india is now in the top three kovite

1430
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:08,079
affected nations in the world

1431
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:10,960
so we have a lesson to learn that how

1432
00:54:08,079 --> 00:54:12,319
authoritarian autocritic nations like

1433
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,319
brazil and india

1434
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:15,920
actually have failed to contain kovit

1435
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:18,558
19.

1436
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,359
and it is important for us as uh you

1437
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,839
know

1438
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:24,000
people and communities who are building

1439
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,599
democracies working egyptian rule of law

1440
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,680
to ensure that we stay in solidarity

1441
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,640
to ensure as i mentioned in the earlier

1442
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:33,759
part of my

1443
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,879
uh sharing that a national plan is built

1444
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,040
to look into

1445
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,960
all these issues a national diversity

1446
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:42,160
policy ensuring

1447
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,720
that we work on an anti-racial law so

1448
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:44,799
that

1449
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:46,799
indigenous people do not face racism

1450
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:50,319
during covet 19 as well as

1451
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:52,400
at other times and to ensure that

1452
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:54,799
women and indigenous people and the

1453
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:57,280
marginalized are not left out of this

1454
00:54:54,799 --> 00:54:58,559
and as i mentioned for this we got to

1455
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:01,520
work at the local level

1456
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,799
galvanized community local level uh

1457
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,400
number two we got to work on the

1458
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,559
regional national level

1459
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,520
and and like as we're doing in writes on

1460
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,240
right now

1461
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,280
we've got to galvanize together to learn

1462
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,759
from each other

1463
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,640
from different global communities to be

1464
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:20,319
able to hold

1465
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:22,720
our governments and nations accountable

1466
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,000
yes uh thank you bina and i think what

1467
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,160
you were saying is true

1468
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:28,079
actually for a lot of governments a lot

1469
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:30,640
of states who are not prepared

1470
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:32,000
for this pandemic even as you call

1471
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,680
little curfew

1472
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,760
some call it lockdown in the philippines

1473
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:37,919
we call it community quarantine

1474
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,040
but they all amount to the same thing

1475
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:44,160
lockdown so our movements are really um

1476
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,480
restricted so yes um

1477
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:48,720
information is very much important

1478
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:52,079
especially at this time

1479
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,240
because we we need to know what's

1480
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:56,480
happening and we need to know what to do

1481
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,160
yes so so because it's almost time or

1482
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,880
almost out of time dina

1483
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:01,359
uh i'll i'll give you um two minutes for

1484
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,839
your

1485
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:06,240
last words before we wrap up this

1486
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,440
session

1487
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:12,720
yes um

1488
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,000
first of all just to thank you lisa for

1489
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:18,160
moderating this asia keynote

1490
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:20,160
thankful to the accessnow team for

1491
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,960
including our voices

1492
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:24,399
uh at this incredible one of the world's

1493
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:26,960
largest gathering

1494
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:28,960
on human rights in the digital world we

1495
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,599
were all supposed to meet at costa rica

1496
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:32,880
but because of kovit 19. i think the

1497
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:35,040
good thing is

1498
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:36,400
that i listened to this incredible

1499
00:56:35,040 --> 00:56:38,960
speech by the

1500
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,920
in the inaugural this morning by the

1501
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,480
information

1502
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:45,440
technology minister from costa rica a

1503
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:46,720
woman engineer she was she was a shining

1504
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,760
example of how

1505
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:50,640
women and girls need to be in the field

1506
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,880
of stem

1507
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,640
we need to get more into be more

1508
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:58,480
software ingenious we got to

1509
00:56:54,640 --> 00:57:02,720
get into let's not leave tech to men

1510
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:05,200
okay let men enjoy cooking

1511
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,000
let women also enjoy how to you know

1512
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:09,040
code

1513
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,040
how to ensure that we are a part of that

1514
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,119
whole process because we still have a

1515
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:16,240
very gender skewed world

1516
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:18,480
of digital divide of technology divide

1517
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:20,799
divide between different genders and

1518
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,599
this is what we've got to bridge for

1519
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:23,759
that

1520
00:57:21,599 --> 00:57:24,799
as i mentioned we need a digital uh

1521
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:27,359
policy for

1522
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:28,720
um for for all of us to make this

1523
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,799
possible

1524
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,839
and work very closely with policy makers

1525
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:33,759
in india and

1526
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:35,520
at the at with governments around the

1527
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:38,000
world particularly the united nations

1528
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:40,240
so that our voices are heard it's so

1529
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:42,480
important to prevail upon our nations

1530
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:43,359
that we live in a very unequal world

1531
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:46,720
today

1532
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:49,200
and we got to bridge that first and uh

1533
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:50,240
to be inclusive of women and indigenous

1534
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,839
people

1540
