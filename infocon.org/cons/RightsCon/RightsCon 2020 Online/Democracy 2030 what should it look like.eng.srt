um we can't do a thank you in the chat

19

really sort of applauding them um that

23
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,800
would be a

24
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,199
brilliant thing to do so i'm amy stutter

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,959
i

26
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,360
work on digital democracy at the

27
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,199
international republican institute

28
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,039
which is a democracy assistance

29
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,320
organization that works in over 100

30
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,120
countries

31
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,438
i am also the founder and ceo of a civic

32
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
tech startup called villager

33
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:10,158
we are here today to talk about

34
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,240
democracy 2030

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,439
so when i first pitched this session

36
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,439
idea to the rights con

37
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,039
team um the world was not even as

38
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,960
terrible as it is today although we

39
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,000
thought it was pretty terrible

40
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,399
uh and the theory was that

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,280
you know um we've been talking a lot

42
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,720
about disinformation digital

43
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,759
authoritarianism all of the various ways

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,640
in which

45
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,240
the digital world threatens democracy

46
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:36,320
but we didn't really have somewhere that

47
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
we were trying to go with democracy we

48
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:39,679
weren't talking about all of the ways in

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,000
which we could embrace digital

50
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,600
to make democracy thrive to support

51
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,320
democratic principles

52
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,839
um and without a roadmap of where it was

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,919
that we were trying to go

54
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,680
how could we really beat the bad guys

55
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,479
what is it that we're actively trying to

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,200
build

57
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,039
um so i'm joined today by uh two of the

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
most thoughtful people on this subject

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,040
they're not just thoughtful though

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,240
they're also

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,880
doers um the first person uh that i'll

62
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,880
introduce

63
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,479
is audrey tang who is the digital

64
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,239
minister in taiwan

65
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,560
and who really encapsulates this idea of

66
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,800
um first of all just a positive spirit

67
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,680
about humanity that says we can harness

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,520
digital to

69
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,040
you know bring the best out of humanity

70
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,640
and has really been doing that

71
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,440
partially through her activism in the

72
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,359
first place and then through government

73
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,520
going forward and then i'm also going to

74
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,840
jump over to nanjala niyabola

75
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
who wrote this really fantastic book

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,319
which if you haven't bought you

77
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,560
absolutely should

78
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
called digital democracy analog politics

79
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,319
it's a study of kenya

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,480
and how this is played out in kenya but

81
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,079
really it's so broadly applicable to the

82
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,840
rest of the world as well

83
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,840
um and the idea that she really gets

84
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:48,720
into is that

85
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,040
you know democracy isn't just uh

86
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,440
democracy isn't just about

87
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,959
the institutions and processes that run

88
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,319
our politics but also about

89
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:58,480
participation

90
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:00,079
um and if you look at participation and

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,119
you look at civil society and you look

92
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,560
at the spirit of

93
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,040
you know how people operate um then

94
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,640
uh then you really start to get a sense

95
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,440
of what democracy could look like in the

96
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,159
future

97
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,519
um so audrey we will start with you um

98
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,959
my first question for you

99
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,239
is you know you you really have led the

100
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,879
transition

101
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,840
in taiwan of what this has looked like

102
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,720
from

103
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,400
analog politics um digital democracy

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,239
sort of brought about this revolution in

105
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,360
taiwanese politics you were part of the

106
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,480
revolution

107
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:33,519
um and now you're starting to see that

108
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,359
institutionalized within taiwan

109
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
as part of political processes and

110
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,920
government um but there was really this

111
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
democratic

112
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,238
spirit that started from the grassroots

113
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,599
and then bubbled up to government could

114
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,799
you talk a little bit about that

115
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,879
experience and

116
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,519
and what it's like to be part of that

117
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:52,480
settling um there's a saying that

118
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,040
anything

119
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,920
that was around when we're born is human

120
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,920
nature

121
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,079
and anything that's introduced after

122
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:02,879
we're born is technology

123
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,560
and in that sense in taiwan democracy is

124
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,560
very much a technology

125
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,400
when i was born we were still under the

126
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,879
martial law there was no

127
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,040
freedom of speech of assembly of the

128
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,480
press and so on those my parents were a

129
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,478
journalist and they have to

130
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,478
constantly walk this very thin line

131
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:19,599
between self-censorship and stay

132
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:23,120
censorship

133
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,880
but then around 89 or so it was the

134
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,680
popularization of both personal

135
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,600
computers

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,000
and the lifting of the martial law we

137
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,759
began to experiment on various ways of

138
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,080
democracies we have

139
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,360
amended our constitution uh several

140
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,359
times uh

141
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:39,040
seeing that the constitution itself is

142
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,720
also a kind of technology

143
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,080
and when we had our first freely

144
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,600
contested presidential

145
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,840
election in 1996 that was already

146
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,600
when the web has been introduced and i

147
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,679
dropped out of junior high school with a

148
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,680
full blessing of the head of school

149
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,440
to start entrepreneurship on web

150
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,600
technology so in taiwan

151
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,639
internet and democracy are not two

152
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,880
things they uh

153
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,800
co-evolved with each other and that's

154
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:05,039
why we brought a lot of those internet

155
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:06,400
governance ideas like rough consensus

156
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,280
radical transparency

157
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,239
and so on into our norms at our

158
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:14,159
political norm

159
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:15,759
so when in 2014 the mps at the time

160
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
were refusing to deliberate

161
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,680
substantially with stakeholders

162
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
the cross-strait service and trade

163
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,680
agreement or cssta

164
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,960
half a million people went to the street

165
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
occupied the parliament

166
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,159
many more online and then one of the

167
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,199
people who

168
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,080
helped to broadcast that conversation

169
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,440
the sunflower conversation uh with all

170
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,639
the different aspects

171
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:41,039
of the csstas deliberated by

172
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,320
more than 20 different ngos at a time

173
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,719
including for example

174
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,320
whether we should allow prc components

175
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,360
and people's republic of china

176
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:51,440
regime components in our 4g telecom

177
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,039
infrastructure which is i guess six

178
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,199
years before any other

179
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,440
country have deliberated that topic and

180
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
so it's a demonstration but it's not

181
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,199
a protest only it's a demo of the

182
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,440
facilitation

183
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,280
listening and skill skills that internet

184
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,000
can provide because unlike broadcast and

185
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,520
television

186
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,360
instead of one person speaking to

187
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,719
thousands of people internet enabled

188
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,720
thousands and tens of thousands of

189
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,479
people to listen to one another and come

190
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,400
to rough consensus which was then

191
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,719
ratified by the head of the parliament

192
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,799
and so it was a successful occupy and so

193
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,759
i'm kind of just a channel to bring

194
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,520
those energy

195
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:26,240
into our decision-making and that's

196
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,120
partly how we enhance democracy during

197
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,280
the pandemic of which we're on the post

198
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,000
pandemic stage for more than 100 years

199
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,679
uh sorry

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,960
100 days now yeah when you're here's

201
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,759
post-pandemic sounds

202
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,599
wonderful uh 100 yeah that's far future

203
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:43,680
isn't it

204
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,280
staying in the u.s 100 days would also

205
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,840
be really nice in fact we take

206
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,479
one day of post-pandemic at this point

207
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,080
um

208
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,840
i want to dig in a little bit on the

209
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,080
principles question that you raised

210
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,960
which i think is just so critical to how

211
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,039
we think about

212
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,560
embracing digital for the purposes of

213
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,440
democracy you know we sort of

214
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,599
shifted from this framework that was the

215
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,880
internet is inherently democratizing

216
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,120
because it allows people

217
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:08,719
access to information and capacity to

218
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,080
talk to each other and it democratizes

219
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,479
the information space

220
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:15,599
to surveillance capitalism and digital

221
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:16,080
authoritarianism and this is inherently

222
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,080
terrible

223
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,440
for humanity and for democratic

224
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,039
participation

225
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,880
um both of which i think are absolutely

226
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:26,880
incorrect and i hope that you know as

227
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,159
we're thinking about this 2030 framing i

228
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,080
think that one of the

229
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:31,599
the ways in which we have to get there

230
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,000
is we have to think about

231
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:35,759
the principles that underpin our use of

232
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,639
the internet right how is it that we're

233
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,360
using

234
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,160
the digital space as government as

235
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,319
people

236
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
what is it that we're expecting of each

237
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,720
other within the digital environment

238
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,758
um as we move toward this kind of future

239
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:51,440
democracy

240
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,120
um taiwan and and when you've spoken

241
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:54,719
about this in the past

242
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,479
really you start with these underlying

243
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,479
principles right like you talk about

244
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,159
open data and the open source movement

245
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,680
you talk about transparency and

246
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,639
accountability

247
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:06,800
you also talk a lot about trust could

248
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:10,400
you talk about what those principles

249
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:12,160
are and why you think that they've been

250
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,318
i don't want to say easy to institute

251
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,919
but easier to institute within

252
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,560
the taiwanese context um than they have

253
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,359
been

254
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:22,000
elsewhere why is it that in taiwan you

255
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,000
haven't

256
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,199
and within the sort of gov zero and the

257
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,960
sunflower movement and then the

258
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,400
government that is followed from that

259
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,318
why is it that you've been able to

260
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:33,120
embrace these principles as part of the

261
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,360
digital revolution

262
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
certainly um digital technology is a

263
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,320
great amplifier

264
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,200
right it amplifies surveillance

265
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:43,599
capitalism it amplifies totalitarianism

266
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,279
before digital technology totalitarians

267
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
are sub-totalitarian

268
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,160
and now it could be totally totalitarian

269
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,719
but in taiwan's case because as i

270
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,920
mentioned

271
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,640
democracy is itself seen as a technology

272
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,760
that we can

273
00:08:54,640 --> 00:09:00,160
iterate that we can improve i have

274
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,600
boiled down the core principles of

275
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,079
social innovation and

276
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,880
digital democracy into three easy to

277
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,000
remember

278
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:10,560
pillars and those are fast fair and

279
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,040
fun and these are the guiding principles

280
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
um

281
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:16,399
for our uh counter coronavirus work

282
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,320
these are guiding principles of our

283
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,480
counter disinformation work

284
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:22,080
it has to be fast in the sense that

285
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,640
people's ideas

286
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,560
gets reverberated into this pro-social

287
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,199
media rather than anti-social social

288
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,239
media

289
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:33,200
so that new ideas very quickly become

290
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,120
collective decisions amplified into the

291
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,360
entire country it needs to be fair

292
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,279
so that people understand that we do not

293
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:41,360
impose lockdowns for takedowns

294
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:43,680
but instead challenge the society to

295
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,200
come up with for example fair ways to

296
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,199
raising the medical mask

297
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,880
to design incentive for example wearing

298
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,839
a mask is to protect yourself

299
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,680
from your own unwashed hands basically

300
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,920
these ideas are more

301
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,160
equally distributed throughout the

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,719
society have a higher r value

303
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:01,600
of memes and finally the fun part also

304
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
important

305
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:05,279
make sure that we use this humor over

306
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,519
rumor way

307
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,320
instead of take downs to fight a info

308
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,000
dammit

309
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,160
we just work on very interesting

310
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,040
internet memes with our spokes dog and

311
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,360
things like that

312
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,560
to make sure that our clarifications are

313
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:18,640
by itself funny

314
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,319
and that people can look at public

315
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,240
participation not as something that's

316
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,240
very serious or very polarized

317
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
but anything that people can contribute

318
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:30,000
to i'm happy to expand on that

319
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:32,560
in the later questions fast fair and fun

320
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,640
fast fair and fun that's wonderful um

321
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,839
okay so now we're gonna jump to nanjala

322
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,839
hi nanjala

323
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,519
uh welcome to the conversation hi thank

324
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,079
you so much for doing this

325
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:44,480
um so i attempted to distill your

326
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:46,160
arguments about digital democracy analog

327
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,680
politics right this idea

328
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,880
that we have and i'm going to attempt to

329
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
do it again but then i'm going to ask

330
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,920
you to do it better

331
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,680
so this idea that you know um the

332
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,439
internet has been democratizing in

333
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,199
various different ways people are using

334
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
it in a democratic way

335
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:02,720
grassroots is using it it has

336
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,920
democratized the information space to

337
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,320
varying extents

338
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:08,560
but politics has remained analog right

339
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:10,560
our institutions haven't kept up we just

340
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:12,640
haven't adjusted the processes

341
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,399
the democratic processes around that

342
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,000
could you talk about that a little bit

343
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,680
and where that came from and how you've

344
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,320
seen it play out in the context you've

345
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,319
been working in

346
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,240
sure um i think for me one of the

347
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,760
most uh telling one of the really most

348
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,079
interesting things that audrey has

349
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:34,079
touched on is the idea of intent

350
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
and how the internet is not necessarily

351
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,959
just this ambiguous thing that's

352
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,959
happening in

353
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:41,199
in this ill-defined space but it's

354
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,439
something that is built to reflect our

355
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,720
intentions and to reflect our interests

356
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,800
as communities

357
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:48,560
and so one of the things that we are

358
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,000
that i wanted to really explore in my

359
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,160
book in my research was

360
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,240
how do the intentions and how did the

361
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,439
does the agency of the people who build

362
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,320
platforms

363
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,200
intersect with um how the platforms sort

364
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,839
of play out

365
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,000
um how does the politics of the society

366
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,880
intersect with how the platforms and the

367
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:07,760
internet and

368
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
and all the technology kind of plays out

369
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,560
in this

370
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,399
respective societies and i focused on

371
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,638
kenya specifically because

372
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,800
um it's not just because i'm from kenya

373
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,760
and i'm in kenya but also because kenya

374
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:20,479
represents

375
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,760
um you know what this uh these

376
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,320
developments look like

377
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,319
on the cusp you know um for so long the

378
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,120
internet conversation was dominated by

379
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,440
the west

380
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,480
was dominated by uh and the eastern and

381
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
the idea that

382
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:34,079
the places where the technology would be

383
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,680
was being built is where

384
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,439
uh the conversations were going to be

385
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,199
the hottest and the most interesting

386
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,560
but really what ended up happening is

387
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,399
this um

388
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,000
because of the legal context in the

389
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:45,279
social political context and a lot of

390
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,560
the developing world

391
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:50,160
that actually the debates that now um

392
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,518
the west and the east the places where

393
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,719
the technology is being built now

394
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:54,639
they're grappling with

395
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,920
are things that we've been dealing with

396
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:58,639
for the better part of the last

397
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:59,920
10 15 years and so it really was a case

398
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,079
of

399
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
looking back at how tech and politics

400
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:06,079
had intersected in kenya

401
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,839
seeing what lessons laid there seeing

402
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,040
the the questions of agency and the

403
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,959
questions of intent

404
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,880
how they intersected with outcomes how

405
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,638
they intersected with outputs

406
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,320
and and sort of trying to see well what

407
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,800
can the rest of the world learn

408
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,160
from what happened um in kenya what

409
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,279
happened what's happening in other parts

410
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,880
of the developing world

411
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,399
and the main lesson is this that you

412
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,399
cannot understand

413
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,440
how technology is going to affect a

414
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,760
society

415
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,440
unless you understand that society

416
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
unless you understand the political

417
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,240
social

418
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,279
history of that society you won't be

419
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
able to predict how

420
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,199
how tech is going to play out you won't

421
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
be able to understand

422
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:42,240
why mobile money is a big deal in one

423
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,839
country and

424
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,600
does nothing at all in a neighboring

425
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,600
country if you don't understand how the

426
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:48,079
dynamics of that particular country play

427
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,600
out

428
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,199
um and that's really what i try to

429
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,720
remind people um

430
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,800
that tech doesn't happen without people

431
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,160
and i love what audrey said about

432
00:13:54,800 --> 00:14:00,399
um the about the the

433
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,160
democracy as being part of the tech

434
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,560
story as as democracy

435
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,399
being a form of technology you're not

436
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,000
going to understand the society

437
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,440
if you don't understand the tech behind

438
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,440
that society the

439
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:12,880
sorry you don't understand how tech is

440
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:16,639
going to affect your society

441
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,240
if you don't understand society

442
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,800
yeah absolutely so um iri my work

443
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,880
in the past when one could travel um

444
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,639
really took me all over the world

445
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,760
um and uh and you know we would try and

446
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,920
come up with

447
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,600
approaches right how do we help

448
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,319
societies and politics

449
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,440
navigate this transition to digital

450
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:40,160
democracy

451
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,079
um in ways that are consistent in

452
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,639
uniform and you know all of that kind of

453
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,079
stuff

454
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,920
and at some point i think we realized

455
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,239
like there's no one-size-fits-all

456
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,319
approach you have to start from

457
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,079
what is it that people are already doing

458
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
and how do you embrace that what are the

459
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,680
problems that people are trying to fix

460
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,760
in their everyday lives

461
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,680
because democracy is really about you

462
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,360
know delivering on those

463
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,880
needs and technology as a way of

464
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,360
enabling that as well

465
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,959
um i want to get in to this question of

466
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,279
principles though because i do think

467
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,199
that

468
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,040
those can be universalized right like

469
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:14,399
when we're imagining a

470
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,439
democracy 2030 yes the processes

471
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:19,199
and the systems and the ways in which we

472
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:20,959
deliver on principles is going to be

473
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,719
different on the basis of every single

474
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,638
society that exists and not just

475
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:27,120
each national society but also every

476
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:29,600
city every interest group etc

477
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,600
um but we can get to the principles um

478
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,880
and and you sort of get into this in

479
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,399
your book a little bit where you're

480
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,759
talking about you know

481
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:41,440
um the democratization of information

482
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:44,480
in unequal distribution of access um etc

483
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:46,079
so imagining democracy 2013

484
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,639
what do you think the consistent

485
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:50,160
principles are that need to underpin

486
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,240
whatever it is that we're trying to

487
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:57,279
build for the future

488
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,759
oh that's a fantastic question um and i

489
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,680
wish

490
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:00,959
more people kind of pushed themselves to

491
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:02,880
really reflect on

492
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,399
okay what does that mean like it's it's

493
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,160
we're in a state where everybody's just

494
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,839
like criticizing criticizing criticizing

495
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,560
and we recognize that the criticisms are

496
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:10,000
valid

497
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,839
and there's something that needs to be

498
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,839
fixed but what is that something that

499
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:14,720
needs to be fixed is a really fantastic

500
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:17,040
question

501
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,279
i think one thing i would say is that

502
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:21,279
access is really important

503
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:23,839
but access cannot be used as a

504
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,639
substitute for being intentional

505
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:28,320
about the platforms that we build and

506
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:29,040
the spaces that we create on the

507
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,560
internet

508
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,399
it's not enough to just say we're going

509
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
to put a mobile phone in everybody's

510
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,279
hand

511
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,639
we also have to think very critically

512
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:40,560
about um

513
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,000
what kind of behaviors what kind of

514
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,199
um uh like for example in right now

515
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,759
we're talking about

516
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:49,120
um gambling online gambling mobile

517
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,199
gambling in kenya

518
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,800
and and there's a lot of actual

519
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
investment there's a lot of push there's

520
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,439
a lot of advertising

521
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:57,279
the whole ecosystem that's being built

522
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,839
around gambling which has led to a

523
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,079
really

524
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:02,000
huge problem with addiction especially

525
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,680
amongst young unemployed people

526
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,520
and that's the thing that you know

527
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,159
putting a mobile phone in everybody's

528
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,160
hand

529
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:10,240
without critiquing what kind of

530
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:13,679
advertising what kind of

531
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,880
um access are we encouraging i think is

532
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,559
leaving us a bit of

533
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
a quandary here in kenya we're going to

534
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:20,879
have to think critically about

535
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,720
the principle behind it so one thing i

536
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
would think about is

537
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,400
access cannot be a substitute for intent

538
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:28,319
access cannot be a substitute for the

539
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,679
more complex moral conversations about

540
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,559
the kind of ecosystem that we're

541
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,520
building

542
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:35,039
um i think uh one thing that is comes up

543
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,440
a lot in conversations here

544
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:39,360
in africa is ownership and what does

545
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:41,200
effective ownership look like what does

546
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,520
inclusive ownership look like

547
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,280
what should a company be able to make

548
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,520
money off a country

549
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
without necessarily being invested in

550
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,400
the social

551
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:52,160
uh political outcomes and ownership

552
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,520
doesn't necessarily mean money

553
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,200
but we're thinking about community

554
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,720
ownership we're thinking about

555
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,480
community oversight we're thinking about

556
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,360
community participation in

557
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,840
charting how these technologies play out

558
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,678
so

559
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,039
to think critically about bringing more

560
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
people on board and bringing more

561
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:08,240
communities on board in the

562
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,799
decision-making processes

563
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:12,880
in the um building and deployment

564
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:14,639
processes i think is really important

565
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,960
we're not just talking about putting a

566
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,880
token uh you know a token african on the

567
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,720
board or token african

568
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,240
on the ownership or leadership team but

569
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,000
we're talking about actually being

570
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:27,200
engaged with the communities

571
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,480
in which our tech is being deployed um

572
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,160
are we thinking about what content

573
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,880
moderation is going to look like for

574
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,559
example

575
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,720
in the societies where we're launching

576
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:37,120
our apps um

577
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,400
and that means of being constant active

578
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,159
conversation

579
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,520
with the communities that that we're

580
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,840
participating in

581
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,760
this top-down approach of building tech

582
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,840
in silicon valley or building type

583
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,360
in you know in china whatever and then

584
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,678
sort of deploying it

585
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:52,559
in context halfway around the world with

586
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,039
no follow-up

587
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:56,000
no support no engagement i think also we

588
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,760
have to push back on

589
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
that i think we have to realize that the

590
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,320
world is really we're deeply

591
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,080
interconnected

592
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,000
um one thing that we should learn

593
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,080
especially from this emergency is that

594
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:08,160
one part of the world gets sick and

595
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,520
we're all at risk we're all gonna be

596
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,320
vulnerable and so we have to work

597
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,760
together

598
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,879
and that in a tech space means actively

599
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,039
bringing communities and societies along

600
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,919
and not just doing this top-down

601
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:23,120
deployments

602
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,000
of tech and platforms without any sense

603
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,918
of responsibility

604
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,120
i think we have to we have to fix that

605
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:29,200
so um

606
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:31,520
i'm encouraged by the fact that a lot

607
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,240
more people are thinking through about

608
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:36,000
these issues civic tech and and you know

609
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,600
community-based development but i think

610
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,360
we still have a little bit more

611
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,799
work that we can do in that regard i

612
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,760
mean just off the top of my head

613
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,760
those are some of the principles

614
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:48,320
yeah absolutely we have a long way to go

615
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
but we are going to get there by 2030 if

616
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,879
the premise of these panels

617
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,960
had um when i was doing promo for the

618
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,280
channel i said that we were gonna cure

619
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:01,200
2020. i'd also like to cure

620
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:07,840
inequality um discrimination all that

621
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:07,840
this is very painless new stuff

622
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:21,280
things that people promised to cure by

623
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,280
2030 all 169

624
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,440
that's right yeah the only truly trying

625
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,520
to cure in this panel is politics

626
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:32,559
i think that everything could stem down

627
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,799
from there

628
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:36,240
but nanjala when you're speaking you you

629
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:38,240
referenced a lot the sort of silicon

630
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,799
valley commercial model around all of

631
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:42,640
this but i think this community driven

632
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:44,559
idea and this idea that it shouldn't be

633
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,320
top down should also be applied to

634
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,000
government right to our institute the

635
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
institutions and processes of

636
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,600
government and this um sort of harks

637
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,080
back to

638
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,678
in the good old days um when we most

639
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,720
people were still optimistic about

640
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,880
things um

641
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,159
tim o'reilly wrote this wonderful paper

642
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,640
called government as

643
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:04,480
a platform and the idea was that

644
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
government as a technology

645
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,679
is really just supposed to be a

646
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,039
collective of the people working

647
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:12,080
together to achieve

648
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:14,080
societal goals right um

649
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,678
it's it's interesting to me because i

650
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,520
think that what we were talking about

651
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:20,080
nanjala is precisely that

652
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:22,799
that question of how do we get rid of

653
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:25,120
this hierarchy of the top down

654
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,039
uh then telling the sort of the consumer

655
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,120
or the citizen what to do

656
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,240
and that's really what we've seen audrey

657
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,559
kind of encapsulate

658
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
and work in taiwan which is to

659
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:37,039
completely overturn this old structure

660
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:39,520
of what government looked like

661
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:41,919
that was really a top-down hierarchy and

662
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:44,080
say no when you harness the energy of

663
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:46,960
the people when you trust the people

664
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:49,199
when you use this incredible technology

665
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,799
to do that to do it efficiently to bring

666
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,240
people into the conversation you come up

667
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,639
with better solutions and you come up

668
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,960
with

669
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:56,720
more buy-in for those solutions um

670
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:57,600
audrey could you talk a little bit about

671
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,919
that you can

672
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,959
you know use the recent context of

673
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,600
disinformation

674
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,440
or covet um but i really love to hear

675
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:06,799
about how you've worked with gov zero

676
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:09,120
how you've translated that

677
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,918
spirit of you know the nobody of gov

678
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:13,840
zero

679
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,840
um into government

680
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,600
services in taiwan is something that gov

681
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,039
tw but people who don't like the

682
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,080
services that the government was

683
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,320
providing

684
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:32,799
invented a way to basically provide the

685
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:34,080
same services for example an overview on

686
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:36,080
budgets and so on

687
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,360
but using exactly the same domain name

688
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:39,360
but with the o

689
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:40,639
change to a zero so you would go to

690
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,199
budget that's g0

691
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,159
vita tw to see the shadow government's

692
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,000
imagination

693
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,080
of the government services always more

694
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,960
interactive and always relinquishing

695
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,639
the copyright it has been adapted to

696
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,880
other jurisdictions as well for example

697
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,919
g

698
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,600
zero g0v.i.t is the italian version of

699
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:59,360
the gum zero and so on

700
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,600
and so the idea of forking the

701
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,280
government i need to pronounce it right

702
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,520
fork the government

703
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:07,918
is for the civil society for the social

704
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:09,280
sector to provide running examples of

705
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:11,120
how the government should work

706
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,799
and relinquish the copyright so that the

707
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,199
government can take after

708
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:17,520
the people and i will say that this is

709
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,360
uh goes beyond the original idea

710
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,120
in the government as a platform in the

711
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,520
team o'reilly's book because there was

712
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,199
still

713
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,639
you know instead of for the people we

714
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,120
need to work with the people

715
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,360
but now we're working after the people

716
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,000
and so just two very quick examples for

717
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:32,479
example

718
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:34,480
uh whereas many uh jurisdictions began

719
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:36,880
countering kernel buyers early this year

720
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,640
taiwan started last year and last year

721
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:40,799
last december when dr lee went

722
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,120
on the prc whistleblower posted that

723
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:44,879
there are seven new stars cases in muhan

724
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,719
he would get inquiry and eventually

725
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
punishment from his local political

726
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:49,520
institutions

727
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:51,678
but at the same time the taiwan social

728
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:54,158
sector the equivalent of reddit

729
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:56,320
but owned by a social sector actually

730
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:58,720
just random bunch of students in the

731
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,158
national tower university called the ptt

732
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:01,919
is a bulletin board system

733
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,200
has somebody just reposting that and

734
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:05,120
people upvoting it

735
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,279
and our medical officers immediately

736
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,279
noticed this post an issue ordered that

737
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:11,120
people flying in from rouhani to start

738
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:13,200
health inspections on the first day

739
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,239
of 2020. and so this shows that the

740
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,080
civil society

741
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,520
actually has a collective intelligence

742
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:20,080
that is even more

743
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,600
intelligent than the state intelligence

744
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:22,399
but the civil society trust the

745
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,399
government enough

746
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,400
to talk about possible service outbreaks

747
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,679
in public forum and that the government

748
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,600
trusted citizens enough

749
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:31,200
to treat it as if sars has happened

750
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,158
again something we've always been

751
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,400
preparing since 2003 and so that's the

752
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
example of the collective intelligence

753
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,440
and another example which is the

754
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:42,880
fairness pillar

755
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:45,440
um stems from the people in tainan

756
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:46,080
that's a southern city of taiwan in the

757
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,679
beginning

758
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,080
when we ramp up the facial mass

759
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,919
production making sure everybody can

760
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,199
collect musk from nearby stores and

761
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,880
pharmacies and so on

762
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,799
people wouldn't trust that the

763
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,520
distribution was fair that we were

764
00:24:56,799 --> 00:25:00,000
indeed

765
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
increasing the production and so on and

766
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,320
so uh how it would

767
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,279
had this idea that he would just uh do a

768
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,039
ushahidi

769
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:09,600
meaning that he would just build this uh

770
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:12,720
map and asking his friends and families

771
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,480
to mark on the map uh which pharmacies

772
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:17,840
or which convenience stores at a time

773
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,240
still has um maps uh this

774
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,959
uh so you can see like this uh says that

775
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,240
the mask

776
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,720
level of this particular pharmacy uh is

777
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:26,960
this

778
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:28,880
for adults and this for children and so

779
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,480
on uh the only thing with this

780
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:35,120
uh like people contributed uh source

781
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,919
is that it uh very soon overwhelms the

782
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:38,000
the bills

783
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:40,480
uh that is to say how after just a

784
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,960
couple days uh owed google 20k

785
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:44,000
us dollars because he overused this uh

786
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,480
google map

787
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,480
api and so that's where the gov zero

788
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
people came in because zero is

789
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,760
specialized

790
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:52,799
uh in helping out the civi technologist

791
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,879
and so harold wood

792
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:56,000
goes on the gov zero chat room says i

793
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,720
have this problem with my

794
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,159
bills can we build some way that doesn't

795
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,559
uh require people to

796
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,480
um just report the numbers and i'm of

797
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:07,039
course one of people who contributed

798
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:09,200
to still and so i just brought his idea

799
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:10,960
to the premier premier soojin chong who

800
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,880
immediately see the value of it

801
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,880
and say that we need to trust citizens

802
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:17,679
with open data and so right away

803
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,400
after 24 hours we started rolling out

804
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,200
this um

805
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:22,880
real name uh rationing of the mosque so

806
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,240
that anyone with the national health

807
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,559
insurance card can

808
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,279
use any of those 100 or more tools

809
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:29,360
including

810
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,480
maps but also for people with blindness

811
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,479
um you know

812
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:34,000
chatbots voice assistants and so on to

813
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,159
find the nearby pharmacy

814
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,360
use their national health card to get

815
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,440
nine masks now

816
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,559
every two weeks if you're adult 10 even

817
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:42,640
a child and

818
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,918
trust the people queuing before and

819
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:46,240
after them to

820
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,120
uh participatory keep this accountable

821
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,960
that is to say

822
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,799
if you swipe your nhi card and you get

823
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,360
nine mask people after you

824
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:55,360
will refresh their chat bot or their map

825
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,120
and actually see the stock level

826
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,799
deplete otherwise they will call this

827
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:00,719
toll-free number to report

828
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,000
something that is wrong so this is a

829
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,000
distributed ledger

830
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,279
participatory made accountable by the

831
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,919
pharmacist and so on

832
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:08,960
analyzed by independent analysts who

833
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,440
built dashboard

834
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,320
to uh soos out the oversupply and under

835
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
supply lines

836
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,080
and eventually prompted the government

837
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,679
to work with convenience stores so we

838
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:20,399
can deliver this 24 hours

839
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:22,799
and this whole process was not under the

840
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,120
traditional top-down procurement laws

841
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:26,399
this is what i call reverse procurement

842
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,799
the civil society

843
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:29,840
built this working prototype that warm

844
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,399
public acclaim

845
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,158
the media reported it and the economic

846
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,559
sector such as google

847
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:38,720
agreed of course to waive his api usage

848
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,840
fees eventually and so all it's left for

849
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:42,000
the government to do

850
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,120
is ensuring timely access in a mission

851
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,000
to mission fashion

852
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,918
to the real-time stock levels of all the

853
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,600
pharmacies and so this is what i call

854
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,000
reverse procurement it can

855
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,439
appear very instantly and when the

856
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,960
people there said uh

857
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,640
what about people with blindness and

858
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,360
things like that instead of by the

859
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,320
traditional

860
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:02,399
uh tender and uh public tender route

861
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,559
we'll just say oh here is the api

862
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:05,600
build your chat bot and so google voice

863
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,158
assistant siri

864
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,158
and so on very quickly started uh with

865
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,880
people who contribute uh plugins and

866
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:12,880
extensions

867
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,559
that allow people to confirm that it was

868
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,120
fair so that is also the fairness

869
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:18,559
principle

870
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:20,639
and that's my second example fantastic

871
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:21,840
thank you um so nangela i'm going to

872
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,679
come to you next um

873
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,000
in your book you use the example of

874
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,720
chase bank which was this bank in kenya

875
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,039
that

876
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,159
massively uh collapsed and it was

877
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:31,919
ruinous for

878
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:34,159
so many people's personal financial

879
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,320
situations is as well as just really

880
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,120
damaging for the economy more probably

881
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:40,720
um there's and the reason that you use

882
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,959
that story is because

883
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:45,760
there was this sort of assertion that

884
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,840
the outpouring of rage on social media

885
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,399
was part of what led to the collapse

886
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,000
right

887
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,760
so there's one response to that

888
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,360
situation that says

889
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,919
um openness free conversation

890
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:59,039
is why this happened right this is this

891
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:01,679
was bad

892
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,200
because of the openness and the capacity

893
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:06,559
for dialogue

894
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,279
um what audrey is describing is that

895
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,000
actually

896
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,159
more openness is what this period calls

897
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:14,240
for right like if there had been

898
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:16,320
in that situation had there been more

899
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,039
transparency had there been more data

900
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:19,039
than the

901
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,640
underlying issues would never have

902
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,520
happened or they would have been caught

903
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,240
earlier

904
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,080
um so these are really sort of two

905
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,600
completely different ways of looking at

906
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,799
what the digital era

907
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,439
means for politics and for society

908
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:35,360
um one says clamp down on information we

909
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,360
need more control and another says

910
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,559
no the way forward is openness and this

911
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,120
is how we embrace it

912
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,918
um do you think that you know the taiwan

913
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,360
case is very

914
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:45,360
special because it's you know this

915
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:46,959
wonderful homogeneous kind

916
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,559
not to say it's not wonderful because

917
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,320
it's so marginalised but it's a

918
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:51,678
wonderful and homogenous country where

919
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:53,439
there isn't as much

920
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:55,520
you know diversity and difference of

921
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,399
opinion and so much chaos in the

922
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:58,240
politics

923
00:29:56,399 --> 00:30:00,000
um whereas you have other places that

924
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,640
are a little bit more chaotic in their

925
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,399
politics

926
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,640
so do you think that this openness and

927
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,840
this kind of sense of social cohesion

928
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:08,480
is replicable elsewhere or do you think

929
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,320
that it's

930
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:11,600
sort of unique to taiwan and it's not

931
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:13,200
something that we can imagine for

932
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,399
democracy 2013

933
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,399
for the rest of the world

934
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,080
um i hope audrey will forgive me for

935
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:22,240
bringing this up

936
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,760
but i remember a couple of days ago

937
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,000
there was the pictures

938
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,919
of the taiwanese parliament and people

939
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:29,840
were throwing water balloons

940
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:31,200
um at each other and there was like a

941
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:33,279
big hullabaloo

942
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,440
um in the parliament and and i bring

943
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:38,000
that up with respect to say that i think

944
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,480
we over we tend to oversimplify you know

945
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,480
what

946
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,840
i mean i think maybe taiwan isn't as

947
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,919
diverse as

948
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,039
you know the drc which has 600 ethnic

949
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:47,679
groups or

950
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,640
um you know kenya which has 40 but it's

951
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:51,440
definitely not

952
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:53,600
a linear sort of political space and

953
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,080
that i bring that up to say that i think

954
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:57,199
the rest of the world or for many of us

955
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,120
we are laboring under the

956
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:01,200
illusion that there's only two ways of

957
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:02,879
doing two models of doing government

958
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:04,000
there's the american model and there's a

959
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,240
chinese model

960
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,679
and you oscillate between the two and

961
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,039
the reality is that

962
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:11,600
there is so much more um out there that

963
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,919
in a

964
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,519
planet of over seven billion people we

965
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:18,399
cannot have exhausted

966
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:19,840
the levels of creativity and innovation

967
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,120
that they exist into the types of

968
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,519
governments that they can live

969
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,158
under and as that's a preface to say

970
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,840
that

971
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,159
when i listen to to audrey speak i hear

972
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,360
something that i also underscored in my

973
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:33,440
book which is

974
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,399
technology cannot be a substitute for

975
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:36,559
trust

976
00:31:34,399 --> 00:31:37,518
the government must earn the trust of

977
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:39,600
the people

978
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:41,120
in order to have the collaborative

979
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,120
spirit with the people

980
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:44,399
to build the kind of technology that the

981
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:47,199
people need

982
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:48,080
i think for many people in many

983
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,919
societies

984
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:52,080
government has misunderstood the point

985
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:53,519
of government that people are aspiring

986
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,559
to be in government so that they can

987
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,960
have power

988
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,799
and power that they then use to opt out

989
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,240
of the difficulties and the challenges

990
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,000
that face their people

991
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,159
and again the pandemic is an excellent

992
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,679
moment to reflect on the fundamentals of

993
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:08,240
government and governance

994
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,480
that the chase bank example is really a

995
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:11,200
symptom of what we were living under now

996
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,640
whereby

997
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,080
the government is misrepresenting

998
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,679
numbers without infections is

999
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,678
misrepresenting numbers about hospital

1000
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,600
capacities misrepresenting numbers about

1001
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,440
ppe availability because they want to

1002
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,439
look good and not because they're

1003
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,799
thinking well actually it's bad

1004
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,960
for kenya if kenyans get sick

1005
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:30,399
and if kenyans lose their family members

1006
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
and if there's a problem

1007
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:34,639
and so instead of working together in

1008
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,519
partnership and thinking how can we

1009
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:36,960
enhance

1010
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,000
trust and how can we be in a

1011
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:42,960
collaborative context with our citizens

1012
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:44,559
there is the power domination top down

1013
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,039
we will impose a way

1014
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:48,399
and then as an organization on the

1015
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,320
people and i just don't think that's

1016
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,518
what the point of government is

1017
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,158
i don't think that's the point of

1018
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:55,600
governance and i think that the illusion

1019
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,799
that political science

1020
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,559
has sold that this is it you're either

1021
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,799
living in an authoritarian

1022
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:04,799
centralized administration or you're

1023
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,519
living under a capitalist exploitative

1024
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,840
system

1025
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,760
is a false promise and the societies

1026
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,720
that are doing the best right now

1027
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:14,640
new zealand taiwan south korea you know

1028
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,440
even germany our societies where people

1029
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,600
are thinking

1030
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:20,240
well what else can government do you

1031
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:22,240
know i saw uh jacinda eder

1032
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,080
say you know one of the first things

1033
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,519
that she did when she came into office

1034
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,158
is she displaced gdp as a metric for

1035
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:30,480
progress

1036
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,360
and started to look at mental health and

1037
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,919
wellness

1038
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,519
and and social security as metrics of

1039
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:38,000
society that's doing well

1040
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,519
once you change the underlying

1041
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,440
epistemology of what you think

1042
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,440
government is for the underlying logic

1043
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,600
of what you think this government is for

1044
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,640
suddenly everything starts to look a

1045
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,360
little bit different

1046
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:51,440
and these soft values that political

1047
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,760
science and international relations have

1048
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:55,440
sort of pushed to the backbone suddenly

1049
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,120
look incredibly important

1050
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,440
trust respect um honesty

1051
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:03,279
openness those are not just things to

1052
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:05,279
teach your kids when they're young

1053
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,480
and then when they turn 18 we say well

1054
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,600
actually that doesn't matter anymore

1055
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
because now you're an adult

1056
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,359
and the world is terrible and you just

1057
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,440
have to adapt what if those became the

1058
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:14,560
core organizing principles of why we

1059
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,560
governed

1060
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:18,320
what would the future look like if a

1061
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:21,040
government came to its people and said

1062
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,639
hey we need your help to navigate

1063
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:24,639
this and we're not just going to impose

1064
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,440
it upon you and that's why the examples

1065
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:28,159
that audrey

1066
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,679
has given are so powerful to you because

1067
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,440
they start to expand

1068
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,679
the imagination beyond just tech

1069
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:37,839
what if we fundamentally change the

1070
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:40,720
reasons why we govern

1071
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,918
to move away from power and domination

1072
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:44,959
to openness

1073
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:46,399
and trust and inclusivity and and

1074
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,800
representation

1075
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:50,879
and um i think that's where the future

1076
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:52,320
lies really i think every this pandemic

1077
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:53,279
is telling us go back to the drilling

1078
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,960
mode

1079
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:56,639
go back to the drawing board and rethink

1080
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:58,560
why you think tech

1081
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,640
is important it's not to help you with

1082
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,279
surveillance it's not to help you with

1083
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,720
control

1084
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:04,640
it's not to help you with power and

1085
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:06,000
domination it's to help you have a

1086
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:08,160
better conversation

1087
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:09,520
with the people that you claim to govern

1088
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,078
that to me is where

1089
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
um 2013 that's kind of where we should

1090
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:15,200
be aspiring towards

1091
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,200
you make my heart sing i might just

1092
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,078
start crying now

1093
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:22,319
um i think that what you're describing

1094
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:25,040
is

1095
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,760
precisely why i do the work that i do

1096
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,920
and i

1097
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,560
evidently it's true for audrey as well

1098
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,640
you know i think um the reason

1099
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:34,320
that government is hierarchical and has

1100
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:36,078
been hierarchical and has had these

1101
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,960
structures in place is because we didn't

1102
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:39,359
have

1103
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:40,480
this technology that exists today right

1104
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:41,920
we had to

1105
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:43,359
for the sake of efficiency and

1106
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:45,200
communication you couldn't have a

1107
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:46,960
collective conversation among everyone

1108
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:48,480
you couldn't have collective trust and

1109
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,640
so you had to have

1110
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,839
systems and structures and if that's no

1111
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,160
longer necessary

1112
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,759
how do we need to redesign everything

1113
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,640
from the ground up so that we are

1114
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:58,640
embracing

1115
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,839
what i think you're describing which is

1116
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:02,720
more democracy

1117
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,240
more participation more inclusion more

1118
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:06,240
creativity from the people

1119
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:08,959
more government as service and his

1120
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,759
platform than government as power

1121
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,760
um audrey you're nodding and clearly

1122
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,599
enthusiastic about everything angela has

1123
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:17,200
said so i want to give you a chance to

1124
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:20,000
respond without dominating this

1125
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:23,439
conversation as well

1126
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,960
well i think the point uh nigella made

1127
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,240
about epistemology

1128
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,599
really is very important epistemology

1129
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,200
is the idea of how we derive knowledge

1130
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,000
and a lot of the knowledge that we

1131
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,118
derive

1132
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,680
is based on age-old metaphors

1133
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,520
for example we say voting without

1134
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,440
thinking that it's just worth three bits

1135
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:46,400
every four years uploaded

1136
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:48,560
per person and we have certainly better

1137
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:51,359
technologies now uh and so

1138
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:51,759
i still think that the words that we use

1139
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:54,160
to

1140
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:55,280
talk about things is very important for

1141
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,759
example

1142
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,240
when we talk about smart cities i always

1143
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:02,720
prefer to talk about smart citizens

1144
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:03,359
and in fact my own job description is a

1145
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,720
kind of

1146
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,759
massive search and replace of the old

1147
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,959
more hierarchical use of tech words

1148
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,680
to a more open more pluralistic word

1149
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:17,280
of digital possibilities my job

1150
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:18,799
description which was written almost

1151
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,119
four years ago now

1152
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,119
which is pinned on my twitter i think

1153
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:24,960
may provide a good footnote to the

1154
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:27,119
epistemological change that

1155
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,760
i personally would really like to see in

1156
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,760
2030 it's very short it goes like this

1157
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,320
when we see the internet of things let's

1158
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:36,560
make it the internet of beings

1159
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:38,720
when we see virtual reality let's make

1160
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:40,720
it a shared reality

1161
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,720
when we see machine learning let's make

1162
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,359
it collaborative learning

1163
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,078
when we see user experience let's make

1164
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:48,960
it about

1165
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:50,720
human experience and whenever we hear

1166
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,839
the singularities near

1167
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,240
let's always keep in mind the plurality

1168
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,240
is here

1169
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,800
i love that the plurality is here um if

1170
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,119
that's not democracy 2030 then i don't

1171
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:08,240
know what it is that's really fantastic

1172
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:08,640
um so i'd like now we've had these

1173
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,479
really

1174
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,759
wonderful conversations about principles

1175
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,680
and sort of the underlying structures

1176
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,480
but i'd love now to talk about

1177
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:18,000
how we make that happen right like what

1178
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,640
is it that we need to do

1179
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:22,079
concretely to take these principles to

1180
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:24,400
take these ideas and

1181
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:26,000
turn them into reality um so there's

1182
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
this wonderful quote and i think it's

1183
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,079
bill

1184
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,599
gibson and i should have looked this up

1185
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,400
before the panel but i didn't

1186
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:32,800
um not using google appropriately uh but

1187
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,280
the

1188
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,520
um the future is here it's just unevenly

1189
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,880
distributed right and 2030 is not so far

1190
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,560
out in the future so we're not going to

1191
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,680
come up with anything radical and new

1192
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:44,560
about how we

1193
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,960
um how we govern and what politics looks

1194
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,520
like

1195
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:48,960
but we can scale up what works um so

1196
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,720
nanjala i'll jump to you

1197
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,720
first and this doesn't have to be about

1198
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:54,399
government processes or institutional

1199
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,560
processes it can just be about

1200
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,320
you know even people's behavior or how

1201
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,359
people are working together to improve

1202
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:01,359
their society

1203
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:03,359
it can also be about government and

1204
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:04,400
processes but where do you see the

1205
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:07,200
future

1206
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:09,920
already existing and what do you think

1207
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,919
is scalable

1208
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,280
i i think one of the things that i i

1209
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,598
spent

1210
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,560
an inordinate amount of time in my book

1211
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:21,440
looking at was

1212
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:23,040
how people were organizing online i

1213
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:25,040
think one of the reasons why social

1214
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:27,440
media has ended up being so important to

1215
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:28,240
political conversations in many african

1216
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,839
countries

1217
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,399
is because the people who built the

1218
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:34,000
platforms had no idea what was happening

1219
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:36,240
and so it was a space that was allowed

1220
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,160
to develop somewhat organically and with

1221
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:40,160
a lot of caveats obviously issues of

1222
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:41,279
access and issues of you know who can

1223
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:43,440
afford the bandwidth

1224
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:44,480
you could afford to participate but just

1225
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:46,800
because there was

1226
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:48,400
no external pressure to commercialize

1227
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,520
these conversations and to turn them

1228
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:52,160
into something else

1229
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:52,560
the very early days of social networking

1230
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,960
um

1231
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:57,599
in many african countries were such a

1232
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,320
great example of what citizens can do

1233
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:02,480
when given the room to have honest

1234
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:03,520
conversations between each other and

1235
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:06,640
with their leaders

1236
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,640
and to turn online spaces into

1237
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,400
microcosms of the kind of societies that

1238
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,839
they wanted to live in and i gave the

1239
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:13,280
example of the multi-ethnic

1240
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:14,720
conversations that are happening

1241
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,079
and you know when you study kenyan

1242
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,759
political science they tell you that

1243
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:19,599
kenya is an ethnic country

1244
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:21,200
and people are you know boasting along

1245
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,160
ethnic lines and the ethnicities

1246
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,640
everything

1247
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,240
but you had these amazing examples of

1248
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:28,400
people mobilizing

1249
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,520
way beyond the ethnic scope way beyond

1250
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,200
original scope to

1251
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,119
you know provide health care for someone

1252
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:36,000
who needed it to

1253
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:37,920
support businesses to expand political

1254
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,440
conversations to provide election

1255
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,920
observation missions

1256
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,960
um you know that that sort of challenged

1257
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,960
the official state

1258
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:46,800
narrative which was a compromise at the

1259
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:49,920
time and so i think that

1260
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,240
when we see the kind of agency and

1261
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,359
creativity and innovation that happened

1262
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,640
in those early days

1263
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:56,640
that's something that i would love to

1264
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:59,200
see more of how can we create

1265
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,839
spaces for citizens in countries around

1266
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,240
the world

1267
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:03,279
to engage directly with each other and

1268
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,919
with their governments

1269
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,000
right and and to really challenge the

1270
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:11,200
stereotypes and the the

1271
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:12,960
um what do you say the the shorthand

1272
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,240
narratives that have evolved around how

1273
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,160
their societies work

1274
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,279
how do we incubate that good and make it

1275
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,240
grow um

1276
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,920
without the online space as i argue in

1277
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,279
many platforms without the online space

1278
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,920
we would not have seen

1279
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:27,920
this tremendous expansion of lgbtq plus

1280
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,720
representation and public discourse in

1281
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:30,640
kenya

1282
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,839
that the traditional media which would

1283
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:35,200
never have given

1284
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:37,680
a movie with two

1285
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,279
female leads the time of day i love the

1286
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:39,839
story with two females at the time of

1287
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:42,319
day

1288
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,520
now inviting a director of such a film

1289
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,440
to say hey

1290
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,359
you've produced the best the second best

1291
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:48,240
performing commercial film in kenyan

1292
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,799
history

1293
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,439
how does that feel this all happened

1294
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,680
because

1295
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,000
you know as you can see plus kenyans

1296
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,078
their allies were able to go online

1297
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,119
and find each other and push back on

1298
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:01,280
this very

1299
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:02,560
stereotypical narrative as you know

1300
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:04,880
being gay is not

1301
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:06,799
african et cetera those are the kind of

1302
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,000
conversations that i think

1303
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,800
um we want to find a way of integrating

1304
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,880
that good

1305
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:14,960
people want to talk to their governments

1306
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:17,200
people want to talk to each other

1307
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:18,400
people want to live in active

1308
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:20,640
communities

1309
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,440
um they don't want surveillance they

1310
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:23,920
don't want

1311
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,480
they don't want unnecessary censorship

1312
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:27,839
they don't

1313
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:30,079
want um you know to be turned into

1314
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:31,680
their very personal deep conversations

1315
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:33,200
they're for advertising

1316
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:35,520
how do we create platforms and

1317
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,160
conversations spaces that make that

1318
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:37,680
possible

1319
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,118
i think is something that we really

1320
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,759
should be thinking about over the next

1321
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,640
couple of years

1322
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,040
wonderful um so audrey same question to

1323
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,200
you

1324
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,599
um what can we scale up that's already

1325
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,598
working

1326
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,599
sure so i talk about reverse procurement

1327
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,200
and there's also the idea of reverse

1328
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:00,880
mentorship

1329
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:01,919
in taiwan for example when i was 34

1330
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:04,160
years old

1331
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:05,200
33 when we freshly occupied the

1332
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:08,480
parliament

1333
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:11,439
i was then recruited as a reverse mentor

1334
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:13,440
to the then minister jacqueline san and

1335
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:15,599
the idea of a reverse mentor is that

1336
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,119
people who are under 35 years

1337
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,599
old who serve as both a mentor

1338
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:22,880
but also someone who learns alongside a

1339
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,880
minister

1340
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,640
basically shadows their work and then

1341
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,440
suggests new directions because the

1342
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,920
younger people

1343
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,839
do not take anything for granted they do

1344
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:32,400
not have this legacy system running in

1345
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:34,240
their brain

1346
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,680
so the idea goes is that the younger

1347
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,479
people should point out the new

1348
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,319
directions

1349
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:39,839
whereas the people in the older

1350
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:42,079
generations provide a

1351
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:43,359
kind of resource and power to make those

1352
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,200
new directions happen

1353
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:46,560
so that's how for example the vita one

1354
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:49,839
consultation method

1355
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:52,720
we deliberated the legalization of uber

1356
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:53,119
strategies using ai based listening

1357
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,759
skill

1358
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,560
conversations first get deployed in

1359
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:58,960
taiwan

1360
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,599
um and so now of course i'm over 35

1361
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:02,480
years old

1362
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:03,920
and so we work with new reverse mentors

1363
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:06,640
under 35

1364
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,480
just today we actually work with more

1365
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:09,440
than a dozen reverse mentors in this

1366
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,760
very building

1367
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,880
uh talking about the new directions how

1368
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:15,319
we need to

1369
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:16,720
power up the people uh who are

1370
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:19,440
specifically uh

1371
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:19,839
interested in uh skills like winners of

1372
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,079
the

1373
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:23,920
world skills competition and so on and

1374
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:26,560
basically treat them as we would

1375
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:28,560
to olympic athletes and making sure that

1376
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,040
not only get on the national day parade

1377
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,680
but

1378
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:33,680
actually integrate into the basic

1379
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,160
schools and high school education so

1380
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,240
that

1381
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:37,520
the younger children who aspire not

1382
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,839
academically but

1383
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:41,920
to where a technical proficiency has a

1384
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:44,160
role model to look up to and they can

1385
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,040
improve the community and the buildings

1386
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,960
by themselves

1387
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:48,800
and building this learning circle

1388
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,720
regardless of the age to a

1389
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,160
lifelong learning and so on and all this

1390
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:54,160
is proposed by people

1391
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,160
uh who are not even 30 years old and

1392
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,560
they serve as reverse mentors

1393
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,160
to minister of labor and economy in this

1394
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:02,000
particular case so all the

1395
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:04,240
12 ministries related to social

1396
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:06,800
innovation now work regularly

1397
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,959
i think about two reverse mentors per

1398
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,440
ministry so that's an idea that i would

1399
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,680
see

1400
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:12,560
uh like to see more people adopt the

1401
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:15,040
other idea

1402
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:16,480
is the participation offices network

1403
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,440
that we have established

1404
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:20,560
after 2016 the idea is that we have

1405
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,680
media officers

1406
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,759
in the uh cabinets in each ministry

1407
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,359
talking to journalists we have

1408
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:29,200
uh for example the parliamentary

1409
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,319
officers talking to mps

1410
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:33,040
and so we really need a new branch of

1411
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:35,359
offices

1412
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,359
talking essentially to hashtags that is

1413
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:40,799
to say when a hashtag is trending

1414
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,520
when the outreach starts to burn uh even

1415
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,119
if it's a small thing like for example

1416
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:47,680
the tax filing system is

1417
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,000
explosively hostile to mac users it

1418
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,560
seems small but it would actually

1419
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,960
enrage a lot of people who had previous

1420
00:45:52,560 --> 00:45:56,240
bad experiences about digital services

1421
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,240
in the government and those

1422
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,319
participation offices essentially

1423
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,000
just talked to the hashtag which doesn't

1424
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,359
have a single representative

1425
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,119
but they can join the conversation

1426
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:05,520
saying everybody who complained about

1427
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:07,680
this

1428
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,680
is cordially invited to the ministry of

1429
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:12,000
finance to co-create

1430
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:14,078
the tax filing experience the next year

1431
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:16,000
um and so we did that in 2017

1432
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:18,240
and our tax filing experience the next

1433
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,720
year have a history high approval rate

1434
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,078
because

1435
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:22,640
thousands of people feel they have

1436
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:23,040
contributed at least one post-it note to

1437
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,560
it

1438
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,079
and the participation office of the

1439
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:29,359
ministry of health and welfare

1440
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,400
uh play a really large role uh in the uh

1441
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:34,000
counter covet work because uh the po the

1442
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,200
participation officer lives with

1443
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:39,839
this dog uh and so uh after each uh

1444
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:40,560
daily central epidemic santa press

1445
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,200
conference

1446
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,400
um the officer would just go home and

1447
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,480
take a photo of the dog

1448
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:47,920
and say hey if you're indoors you have

1449
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,760
to keep three dogs away

1450
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:51,520
if you're outdoor two dogs away so

1451
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:53,760
translating scientific knowledge

1452
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,800
into a meme that is fun you should wear

1453
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:57,440
a mask

1454
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,400
to cover uh your mouth from your own

1455
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:00,400
unwashed hands

1456
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,440
remember the bird to pre-order uh the

1457
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,920
musk and so on

1458
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:04,560
and so this memes travel really quickly

1459
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,720
and because

1460
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,480
they're specialized to talk to hashtags

1461
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:11,118
and make sure that our factual

1462
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:12,640
humor express faster than rumor and if

1463
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:14,400
you laugh about it it's

1464
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,000
um actually you're vaccinated you're

1465
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:18,400
literally unable to feel

1466
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,040
uh this conspiracy theory holds any

1467
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,880
merit

1468
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,558
in your mind and so people would of

1469
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,559
course then contribute to the

1470
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:26,319
matter of fact discussion rather than

1471
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,640
panic buying and so on so

1472
00:47:26,319 --> 00:47:29,920
this kind of hashtag officers are also

1473
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:32,960
what i would like to see

1474
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:34,640
more governments adopting

1475
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:36,240
awesome which actually leads perfectly

1476
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:37,520
into my next request which is actually

1477
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:40,799
to the audience

1478
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:43,759
and to those of you watching here um so

1479
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,960
i would love if unfortunately we don't

1480
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:46,079
we don't have the chat so you can't

1481
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,720
participate that way

1482
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:50,000
but on twitter if you could do democracy

1483
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,919
2013 and then

1484
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,359
indicate something that you think is

1485
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:54,720
working somewhere else that could be

1486
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,160
scaled up elsewhere

1487
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:59,279
that would be wonderful and it would

1488
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,200
make my life so hashtag democracy2030

1489
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:02,480
after this panel i will be coming and

1490
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:05,040

audrey and daniela will see what you've

1492
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:08,800
written as well

00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,000
um okay so my next question you are an

1494
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
enlightened government

1495
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,920
it's 2020 and you're trying to figure

1496
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:16,640
out the future

1497
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:18,640
um what policies do you enact um some

1498
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,720
ideas for me would be you know

1499
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:22,160
open data policies okay we want to be

1500
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:24,720
the government of the future so

1501
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,240
open data is where it's at um

1502
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:28,319

one nanjala i'll come to you first what

1504
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:31,680
policy

1505
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:33,280
should an enlightened government in 2020

1506
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:34,960
be enacting in order to bring about

1507
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,480
democracy 2013

1508
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:39,680
and the audience please answer that

1509
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,680
question too on twitter

1510
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,598
um in the same breath open contracting

1511
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:47,520
open fulfillments

1512
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:49,440
um let people know where their taxes are

1513
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,000
going let them know what the money is

1514
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:53,040
being

1515
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:54,480
spent on um much more enhanced public

1516
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,480
participation so that public

1517
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,280
participation is not just a bureaucratic

1518
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,960
hot huddle

1519
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,319
but that actually people are able to

1520
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:02,640
comment on bills

1521
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,240
people are able to tweet in or to you

1522
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,359
know whatever platform you're using to

1523
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:08,479
message in and

1524
00:49:05,359 --> 00:49:11,200
to um you know say hey actually

1525
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:13,040
this senator who said xyz is wrong

1526
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:13,919
because here's a report that was done by

1527
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,680
this

1528
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,040
organization that shows that that

1529
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:19,359
assertion is incorrect

1530
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:21,200
so to bring people actively in in the

1531
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,400
public participation

1532
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:26,558
process in the budget making process

1533
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,319
you know people are paying taxes they

1534
00:49:26,559 --> 00:49:30,240
should have more of a say especially at

1535
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,279
the local government level where are my

1536
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,959
taxes going

1537
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:35,119
they might not be able to take a day off

1538
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:38,400
work to come and sit into the

1539
00:49:35,119 --> 00:49:40,319
county budget meetings but what if we um

1540
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,000
i mean an evolved government could say

1541
00:49:40,319 --> 00:49:43,839
hey send me your

1542
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,200
budget proposals today's the day we're

1543
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:47,040
having the budget conversation we're

1544
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,720
streaming on vimeo same as

1545
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,079
right scott and you can jump in on the

1546
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,598
chat box and tell us

1547
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:53,760
you know what we think about our budget

1548
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,680
proposals and our digital offices will

1549
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:58,079
actually read your contributions and

1550
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,799
we'll feed into what's happening on the

1551
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,800
floor

1552
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:02,640
move away from the model of just

1553
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,520
democracy's elections

1554
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:05,920
but to actual democracies that process

1555
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,200
of

1556
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,079
constant engaged conversations between

1557
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,319
citizens

1558
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,400
and their chosen representatives and

1559
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,440
that conversation reflects the evolving

1560
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:18,000
needs

1561
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:19,520
of the citizens at any particular point

1562
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,160
um even if that point is between

1563
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,280
elections

1564
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:23,279
those are three things that i could

1565
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,160
think of that that really involved

1566
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,319
government should

1567
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,319
be

1568
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:33,280
i love it okay audrey over to you

1569
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:41,920
i will talk about this um presidential

1570
00:50:39,839 --> 00:50:43,119
hackathon which actually i'm wearing the

1571
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,599
t-shirt it says

1572
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:46,400
presidential hackathon and we've been

1573
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:48,240
running this

1574
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,000
for the third year now we're still

1575
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,160
figuring it out as we go

1576
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:54,160
but the main idea is instead of a

1577
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:55,359
traditional hackathon which takes like

1578
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:57,920
two or three days

1579
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,880
we have a three-month hackathon that

1580
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,119
starts people

1581
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,040
uh with people just throwing out random

1582
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:05,280
ideas into the idea pool

1583
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:07,839
the only thing we ask that they have to

1584
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,520
uh sort that idea under one or more of

1585
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:11,119
the sustainable dividend goals that is

1586
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:13,359
to say one of the 17

1587
00:51:11,119 --> 00:51:15,040
categories and then people from any

1588
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,640
sector can start proposing

1589
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:18,240
how they are going to build data

1590
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,319
collaboratives that is to say

1591
00:51:18,240 --> 00:51:22,319
people who pull together their data to

1592
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,640
solve that particular problem together

1593
00:51:22,319 --> 00:51:26,880
so this year we have more than 200 teams

1594
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:28,558
and then comes around of voting we use

1595
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:30,640
the quadratic voting

1596
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:32,400
method if you have played civilization

1597
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:35,118
six uh you know that method

1598
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:35,520
so the quadratic voting rqv basically

1599
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:37,520
says

1600
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:39,440
anyone in our national participation

1601
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:41,599
platform joined the gov

1602
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,640
tw which counts more than 10 million

1603
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,720
unique uh

1604
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,240
visitors out of 23 million people in

1605
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:49,279
taiwan each of us

1606
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,399
gets 99 points which you can allocate to

1607
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,720
at most 99

1608
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,760
projects uh kind of thought-filtering uh

1609
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,919
one project each

1610
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:57,599
but if you really like one project for

1611
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:00,400
example if you like the idea

1612
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,079
of people putting in the water boxes

1613
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,280
that measures the water pollution level

1614
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:06,480
automatically to

1615
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:08,559
source out uh which or um you know uh

1616
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:10,480
plants that's industrial plants pollute

1617
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:11,599
switch parts of the arable lands of the

1618
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:14,079
organic plants

1619
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,079
uh then you can vote more so if you vote

1620
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:17,359
two votes on that that's going to cost

1621
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:19,359
four point in total

1622
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:20,640
and three votes is going to cost nine

1623
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,640
and four sixteen

1624
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:24,480
and so on uh and the idea is that it's

1625
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:26,240
quadratic so the marginal cost of each

1626
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:28,720
new vote is the same as marginal

1627
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,640
return and so uh with 99 points you can

1628
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:32,160
only vote nine votes on any particular

1629
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,359
project you still have

1630
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:36,960
some votes left 18 to be precise and so

1631
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:39,359
with 18 points you will be

1632
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:41,119
motivated to find something else uh to

1633
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:42,720
vote for example four votes which would

1634
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,720
cost 16 and you still have

1635
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:46,319
two points left and you're motivated to

1636
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,240
look into two other projects

1637
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,920
and then maybe you discover synergy so

1638
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:52,078
you will throw some of that back

1639
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:53,920
and so the social preferences there's no

1640
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,400
strategic voting everybody is

1641
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:56,960
motivated to vote up to their knowledge

1642
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:58,559
and so

1643
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:00,880
the one that with the highest number of

1644
00:52:58,559 --> 00:53:02,480
the votes is most likely to develop

1645
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,880
synergies between those

1646
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:06,240
various different proposals and then we

1647
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:08,720
coach them to find

1648
00:53:06,240 --> 00:53:10,640
this uh trilingual teams that is to say

1649
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:12,558
people from the private sector from the

1650
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,200
social sector and also from the public

1651
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,319
sector

1652
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,480
in each team to prototype their idea for

1653
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,720
a couple more months so after the three

1654
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:23,040
months of the competition

1655
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:25,118
uh really people who have demonstrated

1656
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:27,599
in the final pitch to the president

1657
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,400
uh already see a kind of a glimpse of

1658
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:30,960
the future

1659
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:32,880
already uh from their uh two months or

1660
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:35,359
three months prototype for example

1661
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:36,960
one would say that in the rural or even

1662
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,759
remote islands we will use

1663
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:42,000
5g network to connect together people in

1664
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,160
ambulances people in the remote places

1665
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:46,319
and the nurses and the doctors and so on

1666
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:47,680
with the specialized doctors uh from the

1667
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:49,440
main taiwan island

1668
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:51,200
so that people can trust their local

1669
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:52,720
nurses and conductors more

1670
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:54,558
the only problem of course is that it

1671
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:56,078
was against the law we didn't have that

1672
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,760
part of the telehealth law

1673
00:53:56,079 --> 00:54:00,400
but it doesn't matter it's like a

1674
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,520
sandbox they can try it out uh in the

1675
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:06,319
three months and so after this qv round

1676
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:07,680
they would get into the final 10 and

1677
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:10,240
finally the final five

1678
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:11,598
and it's almost always a collection of

1679
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:14,160
augmented collective

1680
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:14,720
intelligence with ai nci elements and

1681
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:17,279
then

1682
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:19,359
we hand them a trophy a trophy is a

1683
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,079
shape of taiwan with a micro projector

1684
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:22,240
underneath

1685
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,119
that if you turn on the micro projector

1686
00:54:22,240 --> 00:54:25,839
it projects

1687
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:26,240
the president herself dr sanguin handing

1688
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:27,920
you

1689
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:29,839
the trophy it's a meta trophy it

1690
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:31,760
describes itself basically saying

1691
00:54:29,839 --> 00:54:32,880
whatever you have tried out in the

1692
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:34,800
previous three months

1693
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,720
uh will become national policy in the

1694
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,280
next 12 months this is presidential

1695
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:40,319
power

1696
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:42,400
as a hackathon award uh five teams uh

1697
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:44,079
every year so we're expanding our

1698
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:46,319
international track a lot

1699
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,920
next year you're welcome to join but

1700
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,839
we're still figuring the rules out

1701
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,760
especially the quadratic voting

1702
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,359
and funding part so if you're interested

1703
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:55,599
in that of course i'm also

1704
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:56,799
on the board of radical exchange with

1705
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:58,720
glen weil and victor

1706
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,559
buttering danielle ellen we're still

1707
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:02,720
trying to figure out this uh drinking

1708
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:05,040
our own champagne in our decision-making

1709
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:06,720
system but the whole idea is that when

1710
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,240
the governance rules gets

1711
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:10,240
experimented under say ethereum

1712
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,000
community we take it into the

1713
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:14,479
presidential hackathon which is this

1714
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,160
meta sandbox that will prompt new ideas

1715
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,520
and the presidential power the power

1716
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:19,759
that used to be top down

1717
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:23,280
that can be shared using this kind of

1718
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:25,200
token as trophies

1719
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:26,400
that's wonderful so we only have three

1720
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:28,720
minutes left

1721
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:30,559
um the question that i'd like to end on

1722
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,040
uh and this is again for all of you

1723
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:36,319
watching hashtag democracy2013

1724
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:39,359
um it's 2030 you are a human being

1725
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:41,440
in society hopefully in democracy um

1726
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:42,720
you're very happy about the way that the

1727
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:44,960
world is

1728
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,839
what does that mean what's the very best

1729
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:48,480
thing about

1730
00:55:45,839 --> 00:55:49,520
2013 your role as a citizen and as a

1731
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,200
human in the world

1732
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,119
um audrey will start with you and then

1733
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:56,000
we'll go to nanjala and you only have 30

1734
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:56,000
seconds to answer

1735
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:01,279
really so i will be most happy if all of

1736
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,319
the taiwan's

1737
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:07,920
20 or more national languages um can

1738
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:10,160
uh enable this code presence using 5g or

1739
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,559
6g since we're talking about 2030

1740
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:14,720
so that not only human have voting

1741
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,079
rights but according to our indigenous

1742
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,240
culture the savior

1743
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:19,280
the tip of taiwan which is still growing

1744
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,118
every year

1745
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:23,119
two and a half centimeters because the

1746
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,559
earthquakes they can also vote

1747
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:28,640
the rivers can also vote people who

1748
00:56:26,559 --> 00:56:30,000
basically can suffer anyone who can

1749
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,319
suffer can vote

1750
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,760
and that includes not only animals but

1751
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:36,000
also the entire

1752
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,920
um landscape including the oceans and

1753
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,480
the mountains and so on so that we will

1754
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,799
include

1755
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,400
uh maximally this is like populism with

1756
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:45,680
a wider population

1757
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,359
uh things that were treated as things

1758
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,520
and we will be able to see them as

1759
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,680
people as our indigenous coaches teaches

1760
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,680
us

1761
00:56:54,480 --> 00:57:01,359
tough talk to follow um that i am

1762
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,280
happy that i'm able to pursue my

1763
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,880
interests without feeling pressure to

1764
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,280
join the wrath race

1765
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,559
that i am healthy that i'm able to see a

1766
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:11,040
health practitioner

1767
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,640
um whenever i don't feel well with this

1768
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:14,160
little obstacle and this little

1769
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:16,400
cost between me and that health

1770
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:17,359
practitioner that my environment is

1771
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:20,559
clean

1772
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:22,558
and protected that um it's not

1773
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:24,480
the air is not making me sick the water

1774
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,880
