00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,320
access now

3
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:35,280
it is a great honor to kick off

4
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
this year first ever online version of

5
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,680
the summit

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:41,280
and i have to say a couple of months ago

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,239
i thought that there would not be a

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,200
right gun

9
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,038
so i am in awe of the incredible

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,160
resilience of this community

11
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,199
to make it happen you're the one

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,199
who submitted sessions who

13
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,199
built the program who extended

14
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,839
invitations

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,839
and

16
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,479
the appetite demonstrated to join in

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,840
really reflects

18
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:10,479
the importance of having this platform

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,400
every year we would like to say that the

20
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,280
topics and the issues discussed at

21
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,479
writescon

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,640
are timely and relevant this year

23
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,039
there is an urgency for us to address

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,040
issues

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,240
sometimes um or that we were putting

26
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,479
away

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,360
because of their complexity or because

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,200
they were making us

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:38,320
uncomfortable the threats we're facing

30
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:41,759
are very real but at the time

31
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,279
decisions are really rich and i am

32
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,840
so excited for this week i can't wait to

33
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,439
learn

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,960
from the different speakers and

35
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,639
different contributors

36
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
whether it's in the sessions or in the

37
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,880
forum i am

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,039
looking forward to challenging myself

39
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,399
and to getting out of my comfort zone

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,000
and i hope you will too so without you

41
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:04,560
i would like to hang over to the

42
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,600
extraordinary nikki glaston the director

43
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,560
of right gun

44
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,160
who together with our team pulled all of

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,800
this thing together

46
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,799
over to you

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
thanks so much melody um hi everyone i'm

48
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,840
nikki gladstone i'm the

49
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,359
director of writescon with access now

50
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
and i wanted to

51
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,680
echo melody informally welcoming you to

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,160
the ninth iteration of our summit series

53
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,080
and

54
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,760
the first to happen entirely online

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,519
which is something i

56
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,440
didn't think i would say before this

57
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:36,000
year um and one of the things that i

58
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,079
think i was

59
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,519
most worried about when we were

60
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,440
transitioning online

61
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,440
worried that i would miss the most is

62
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,280
the the energy of everyone from the

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,480
community in one room

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,319
and you know i think

65
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,000
it's really powerful to think sitting

66
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,319
here in toronto knowing

67
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,160
that everyone is connecting across

68
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,359
different places from their own corners

69
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
of the world

70
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,959
um and you know whether you were meant

71
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
to be in costa rica or whether you

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,000
weren't going to be able to join us in

73
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
costa rica it's really powerful

74
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,440
to know that we are all able to be here

75
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,399
together connecting

76
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,840
um as a community and i think redskins

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,239
going to look

78
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,760
very different in this environment for

79
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,959
many reasons

80
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,799
and we thought a lot about that when

81
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,159
deciding how to take it online and i

82
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,000
think anyone who's ever been to

83
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,480
writescon can appreciate

84
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,680
how complex it sounded to bring

85
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
something that large that dynamic online

86
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,959
and as we went through the process i

87
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,280
think something that we

88
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,640
always knew was that we had to do it it

89
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,040
wasn't a question of

90
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,559
would we bring it online it was just how

91
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:39,679
would we do it and how would we do it

92
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,080
justice

93
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,040
um and many an overwhelming majority of

94
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,879
many of you

95
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,319
told us that it was important to you too

96
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,720
that we did that

97
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,720
when we did a survey asking if that was

98
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,680
what was wanted and needed

99
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,879
and asking you if you wanted rightscon

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,400
to come online

101
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,959
you told us that you would take that

102
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,319
jump with us and so thank you for doing

103
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,920
that and for being there

104
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:05,760
being here with us um you know in the in

105
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,839
the current context as the spaces that

106
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,879
we're used to holding together

107
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,280
are shifting and moving and adapting

108
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,319
in a lot of cases they're also shrinking

109
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,478
community building

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,358
and connecting and these types of

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:21,279
convenings are more important than ever

112
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,280
in this context i think and i really

113
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:24,559
believe that civil society has to create

114
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,638
its own space

115
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,320
and that space is here at rights con

116
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,840
it's what's been created and

117
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,120
it's where we are welcoming an

118
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,479
incredible 7828 participants from 158

119
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,479
countries

120
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,880
and we're welcoming you all to a

121
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,840
platform that's main purpose is to be

122
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,120
a space for you to strategize have

123
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,880
conversations

124
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,160
and really move forward your work

125
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,479
collectively

126
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:52,240
and with that it is my absolute pleasure

127
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,240
to hand it over to brett solomon

128
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:55,680
executive director of accessnow to talk

129
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,160

130
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,600
are

131
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,800
at the top of the agenda and let you

132
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,759
know who will be joining us for the

133
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
opening ceremonies

134
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:12,320

mute or live streaming

144
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
in one way or another uh but i think we

145
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,080
could take a moment just to

146
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,479
clap or even rise for a standing ovation

147
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,199

and you know when we talk about digital

154
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,520
transformation from offline to online i

155
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
think this is what

156
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,960
people are talking about this rapid

157
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,880
immediate

158
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,479
demand to move things from an offline

159
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,840
environment to an online environment so

160
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,719
congratulations to the team for

161
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,479

this ninth annual rights con this time

163
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,840
online our mission as an organization

164
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,199
as the host of rights con as access now

165
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,280
is to defend and extend the digital

166
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,319
rights of users at risk

167
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:20,159

168
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
locations across the world i'm currently

169
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,600
in australia

170
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,120
which would explain why it's night time

171
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:28,000
outside that door

172
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,680
and in a few few moments i'd like to

173
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,919
invite

174
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,440
tendai achoomi who's the un special

175
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,680
repertoire on racism

176
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,479
racial discrimination xenophobia related

177
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,919
intolerance to join the conversation

178
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:44,880
we couldn't be more pleased to have her

179
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,680
join he join us here and to open the

180
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,840
conference

181
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,440
and it's not a coincidence that she will

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:53,758
be our first speaker

183
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,639
it's clear that we all have a lot to do

184
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:58,160
in order to achieve racial justice

185
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:00,080
across the world and particularly in the

186
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,199
tech space

187
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,560
and as a white man i recognize that it's

188
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,400
important for me

189
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:10,560
to um to be an ally to listen intently

190
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,479
and to challenge my own prejudices and

191
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,319
race-based assumptions and actions

192
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,318
and you know this is the beginning of a

193
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,280
journey for many of us

194
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,680
and over the coming days i really invite

195
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,599
you

196
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:24,000
to think deeply about racial injustice

197
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:27,120
and justice in these discussions

198
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,800
about colonialism and declinality

199
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,039
this is an intersectional issue that

200
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,960
requires an intersectional response on

201
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,280
the basis of gender sexual orientation

202
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,960
disability status and class

203
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,960
and i'm sure that this special

204
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,479
rapporteur will talk more to this

205
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:41,758
it's also particularly pertinent in

206
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,680
australia where i am where the black

207
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,160
lives matter movement has spread

208
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,080
and where australians of all different

209
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,680
backgrounds are demanding justice for

210
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:52,800
indigenous australians

211
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,919
from prisons to tech platforms

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,800
and whilst rightscon has delved deeply

213
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
over the years

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,960
into issues of inclusion and diversity

215
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,440
and identity

216
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,120
it has not actively had an anti-racist

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,400
agenda

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,400
let us change that today

219
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,240
the issue of racial justice is the first

220
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,560
theme i therefore want to draw your

221
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,800
attention to

222
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,800
the second of course is the issue of

223
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,080
public health digital rights and covert

224
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,000
19

225
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:25,039
and it's related to the first matter

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,039
because we know everywhere

227
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:29,280
uh in the world racial ethnic and

228
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,639
national minorities are hardest hit by

229
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,880
the pandemic

230
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:33,839
these populations are in essential

231
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,679
services

232
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,599
on the front line and the least likely

233
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:40,399
to be connected where disconnection can

234
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,599
mean living in a society

235
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,920
living in a socially isolated desert or

236
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,480
if without public health information not

237
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,319
living at all

238
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,519
so many of the sessions over this week

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,720
naturally therefore

240
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,920
will focus on health a theme that was

241
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,160
actually nascent

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,439
in last year's discussion ahead of the

243
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,000
pandemic

244
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,040
now it's the track which every session

245
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,200
will likely follow

246
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,319
follow to some degree or other from

247
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,720
contact tracing

248
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,920
to immunity passports to the vitality of

249
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,000
connectivity

250
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,839
to immunosurveillance to the future of

251
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,800
privacy

252
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:19,839
to digital identity this is certainly

253
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,000
the pulsing challenge for rightscon 2020

254
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,600
to survive the crisis of the health

255
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,920
pandemic

256
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,040
but not to exacerbate a human rights

257
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,439
crisis in doing so

258
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,319
at rights con we know that rights can

259
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,480
only be achieved through participation

260
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,240
but the world over as nikki indicated

261
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,880
civil society participation

262
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,120
is also being excluded we can't

263
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,720
necessarily protest in the streets

264
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:46,480
we are prevented from entering

265
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,240
parliaments and congresses as maria

266
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:50,240
rezab will tell us in a moment

267
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:52,000
as our representatives gather behind

268
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:53,600
closed zoom calls

269
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,760
we are watching new laws emerge from

270
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:58,160
brazil to india without consultation

271
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,080
with experts and activists on the ground

272
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,040
so this is the third standout issue

273
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,240
family for me political participation

274
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,399
and the right to assembly which is why

275
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:10,000
accessnow released a report today on the

276
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,600
impact of technology on the rights to

277
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,120
freedom of peaceful assembly

278
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,399
and of association worldwide

279
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:21,680
so so rightscon is here

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,240
online this time assemble to create and

281
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,880
hold

282
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,399
our own space and i want to convey my

283
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,600
deep respect for the activists and

284
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,680
social movements

285
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,560
who are rising to meet the needs of this

286
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:34,560
moment

287
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,920
which on top of all the other challenges

288
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,839
that you're currently facing

289
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,680
or that you already face is really

290
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,800
monumental

291
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:44,479
and to that we welcome almost 2

292
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:46,240
000 corporate government and

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,720
intergovernmental colleagues

294
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,320
to join us as equal partners in these

295
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,959
discussions

296
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,880
and i encourage you to take a moment to

297
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,399
listen intently especially to the most

298
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
marginalized

299
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,440
we have almost eight thousand people who

300
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,279
will gather this week

301
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,480
and the majority of them are from civil

302
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,240
society

303
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,600
but one representative from government

304
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,920
who i'll be pleased to

305
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,600
introduce in the opening panel is the

306
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,279
costa rican minister for science

307
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,600
technology and telecommunications

308
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:17,279
minister castillo

309
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,040
but we can only do all of this with

310
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,320
connectivity and with the half the

311
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
population online

312
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,440
that means half the world's population

313
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,320
offline and so many people

314
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:29,440
personally experiencing shutdowns our

315
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:31,680
work seems to be getting harder

316
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,519
we are working closely on intentional

317
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:35,199
disruptions of the network from ethiopia

318
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,600
to myanmar to kashmir

319
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,959
this year has already seen 53 shutdowns

320
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,120
in 15 countries

321
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,279
and the keeper don coalition is working

322
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:44,240
hard in the courts from togo to

323
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,760
indonesia

324
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,839
to prevent that where it was held

325
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,319
in a sense that access to the internet

326
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,760
is a right which cannot be taken away by

327
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,440
the state

328
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,240
but the battle for global rights

329
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,760
respecting connectivity has not been won

330
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,920
and this is the fourth theme that we

331
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,920
must address

332
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,760
so to conclude every year rightscon

333
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,719
there are multiple external human rights

334
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,720
abuses and

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,800
crises which are unfolding last year our

336
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:13,279
attention was on sudan

337
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,760
and on hong kong this year the crisis

338
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:17,519
has again intensified in hungary

339
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:20,000
where there is a press freedom emergency

340
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:22,639
being broadcast in real time

341
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:24,320
the biggest news site index which is

342
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,240
perhaps the last remaining or one of the

343
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,399
last remaining independent news sites

344
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,079
and saw its editor-in-chief fired and

345
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:32,560
the subsequent resignation of the full

346
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:35,120
editorial staff of about 100 people

347
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,920
this is particularly devastating in

348
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:37,519
europe

349
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,120
and to that end we'll be joined by one

350
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,240
of the leading press freedom advocates

351
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,079
maria reza

352
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,920
who was listed by time magazine as one

353
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,839
of the hundreds most influential people

354
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,920
of 2019

355
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,160
as she has extensively reported in the

356
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:53,199
philippines on president duterte's

357
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:55,040
deadly crackdown including in his state

358
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,320
of the union address which just happened

359
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,880
prior to this

360
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:01,519
opening ceremony and she will be our

361
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,920
third speaker in the lineup today

362
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:07,360
and like each year i want to draw

363
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,199
attention to the plight of allah

364
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
who has been detained in his home

365
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,880
country

366
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,000
of egypt for almost all of the 10 years

367
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,040
since he spoke

368
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:18,800
at rights khan in 2011. his sister wrote

369
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:21,120
to me today

370
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,959
to say that allah a software engineer

371
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,880
and advocate has now been in maximum

372
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:27,839
security for 10 months straight

373
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:29,360
in horrific conditions and since and

374
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:29,920
that's the photograph of him when he

375
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,959
spoke

376
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,519
in 2011 and thank you for putting that

377
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,839
up

378
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,279
since the crisis of covet started she

379
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,360
told me today that the egyptian

380
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,880
government has used it as an excuse to

381
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,800
tighten the isolation

382
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,639
and denial of rights of all prisoners of

383
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
which there are thousands

384
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:48,399
her letter and her full story can be

385
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,638
found on the accessnow website

386
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,760
and again shows the intersectionality of

387
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:53,279
all of the issues that we'll be

388
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,760
discussing at writecon

389
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,800
over this coming week across over 300

390
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,199
sessions

391
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,839
and i think that's my roundup so let us

392
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,079
hear

393
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,760
please from our first speaker the un

394
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:06,239
special rapporteur tendai

395
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:08,800
jimmy please the floor is your special

396
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,800
rapporteur

397
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:14,480
and thank you very much nikki and the

398
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,800
entire team

399
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,040
for including me in this amazing session

400
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,959
i really regret that

401
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,639
we cannot all be together in person but

402
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:23,760
i'm really excited to be able to join

403
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,880
you

404
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,959
virtually as you're all aware nationally

405
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,720
and transnationally and uprising

406
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:32,800
triggered by the murder of george floyd

407
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,440
has really forced a long overdue

408
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,199
interrogation of systemic racism

409
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,880
not just in the context of of law

410
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,599
enforcement which itself heavily

411
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:42,240
implicates

412
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,560
um tech but it's forcing a conversation

413
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,040
around systemic racism in all fields of

414
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:47,119
life

415
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,279
and the area of tech is one where this

416
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:50,800
conversation is equally

417
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
urgent and so i'm really pleased that

418
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
this is going to be a theme that is

419
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,720
addressed

420
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:57,519
in different settings and one that's

421
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:00,560
addressed alongside other themes such as

422
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:03,040
health and other human rights issues

423
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,638
i'm joining you today because my last

424
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:07,279
report to the human rights council which

425
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:09,440
actually i just presented in july 2020

426
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:11,439
focuses on racial discrimination and

427
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,440
racial injustice in the field of

428
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,720
emerging digital technologies and their

429
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,360
design

430
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,199
and in their use and even while the

431
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,959
issues are especially salient right now

432
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,439
i want to highlight that i began working

433
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:24,479
on this

434
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,079
issue about 18 months ago and i was

435
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,040
motivated to do so by

436
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:30,479
a number of factors um on the one hand

437
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
there were definitely

438
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,079
researchers and advocates who were

439
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,120
working on racial justice issues in the

440
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:37,040
field of tech

441
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,160
i found that those groups tended to be

442
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,880
marginalized from

443
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:42,079
the most salient conversations within

444
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,079
the un system and

445
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,758
even within the human rights field

446
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,160
around how we think about

447
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:49,120
that intersection between tech um and

448
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,959
human rights

449
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,880
and then in conversations around tech

450
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:54,880
and human rights to the extent that

451
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:57,279
racial justice and racial discrimination

452
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,079
issues were a part of the conversation

453
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,759
they tended to focus very narrowly on a

454
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,758
set of issues involving

455
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,160
hate speech online and perhaps content

456
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:07,839
moderation those are important issues

457
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:09,519
but as we will be discussing in this

458
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:11,199
opening ceremony and i hope in some of

459
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,519
the other sessions you will have

460
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:15,680
that's just the tip of the iceberg and

461
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:17,199
so my sense was that in the tekken human

462
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,758
rights space the most

463
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,279
focused on norms that were receiving the

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,040
greatest attention at least within the

465
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,079
un framework were

466
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,360
privacy um freedom of expression and

467
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:28,719
then there were some other powerful

468
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,720
interventions from other special

469
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,279
rapporteurs who focused on socioeconomic

470
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,440
rights

471
00:16:31,279 --> 00:16:35,519
but there was a need to really grapple

472
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,720
with what human rights norms around

473
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,040
racial justice

474
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,320
um and racial equality really have to

475
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,240
say about the tech

476
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:44,079
the tech space how tech is designed and

477
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,160
how it is used and so

478
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,239
the report that i hope will be able to

479
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:49,199
to go into in more detail really tries

480
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,279
to bring

481
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,719
some of that analysis taking what i

482
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,800
describe in the report

483
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,320
as an intersectional and a structural

484
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,279
approach to thinking about racial

485
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,440
justice

486
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,959
issues so in brett's introduction he

487
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,519
spoke of the importance of thinking

488
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:03,680
about

489
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,720
racial justice and racial discrimination

490
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,559
alongside

491
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,240
other forms of injustice and

492
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,119
discrimination whether it's on the basis

493
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,000
of gender

494
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,359
disability status class and my report

495
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,959
very much attempts to take an

496
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:16,879
intersectional approach

497
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,400
and when i say a structural approach i

498
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,199
mean moving beyond

499
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,880
just cases where we have explicit

500
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,880
prejudice you know and there are many

501
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,039
cases where you have

502
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,799
discrimination against racially or

503
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,400
ethnically or religiously specified

504
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:30,960
group where there is an intent to harm

505
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,280
them

506
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:35,440
using emerging digital technologies as

507
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,520
the case of the uyghurs in china i think

508
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,679
gives a very vivid example but there's

509
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:41,840
also many other cases where there is

510
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,640
just the disparate impact of technology

511
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:46,879
actually reinforces reproduces

512
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:49,280
and in some cases even exacerbates

513
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,840
structural racial discrimination

514
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:53,760
all over the world another aspect of the

515
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,000
report is that it offers a global

516
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:58,240
analysis sometimes conversations around

517
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,480
racial justice and racial injustice

518
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,720
can be skewed towards certain regions

519
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,039
but what the report really aims to do

520
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,200
is to show that we have a global problem

521
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,600
here and it's very important that we

522
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,679
bring

523
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:11,039
global norms to bear and they're very

524
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,200
powerful norms

525
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,960
in this in in the human rights framework

526
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,520
that can be deployed

527
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,240
more robustly than they they have been

528
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,240
and so

529
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,240
i'm i'm hoping in part through the

530
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,240
conversations that will be had

531
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
at ridescon that the human rights

532
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,679
community will act

533
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,720
more forthrightly and take on more

534
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:30,559
centrally

535
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,919
issues to do with racial justice and

536
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:34,160
racial injustice

537
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:36,000
and racial discrimination in the context

538
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,760
of emerging digital technologies because

539
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,760
that is one of the ground zeroes

540
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,879
of where we see some of the greatest

541
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:42,720
harms and so

542
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,320
i'll and then i look very much forward

543
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:44,960
to this conversation that we're going to

544
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,480
have

545
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,240
in this session and then to also the

546
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,640
sessions that will follow

547
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,640
thank you

548
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,559
thanks very much and i think now it's an

549
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,678
opportunity to hand over to

550
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:04,000
to maria reza from rapla she's the ceo

551
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:05,360
and the founder uh maria i know you've

552
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:07,919
had a very busy day

553
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,360
uh with the set of the union address

554
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,000
love to hear from you for a couple of

555
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,199
minutes

556
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,320
then we'll hear from the minister and

557
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,960
then we'll come into a group

558
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,960
conversation

559
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:23,280
you know the first one is to pick up

560
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:26,080
from what hande said is that

561
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,879
uh let me just call i think the biggest

562
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,879
shift that has

563
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,360
impacted rights all around the world is

564
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:34,160
a behavioral modification system

565
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,840
we know as social media but it is

566
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,440
actually

567
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,320
exacerbating the worst of human nature

568
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,880
and it is

569
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,520
a behavioral modification system right

570
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,679
uh in

571
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:45,280
in my case we'll talk about it in terms

572
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,440
of the philippines

573
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:49,039
and uh the battle for facts which

574
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,760
actually is happening all around the

575
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,480
world

576
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:54,559
and in um let me put it in the battle

577
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,679
that we've had for the last four years

578
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,280
which was

579
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:02,960
um basis right so in 2015

580
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,399
president duterte um won the elections

581
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,919
in may of 2016

582
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
that was really the beginning of the

583
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:10,080
domino effect right going all the way

584
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:13,199
through the next month was brexit

585
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,840
um in 2016 that was also the first year

586
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,320
when

587
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:18,480
we came under attack for impunity

588
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:20,960
challenging impunity on two fronts

589
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,840
a brutal drug war here in the country in

590
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,120
the philippines

591
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:25,760
and social media silicon valley and its

592
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:28,879
impact

593
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,840
on on our information ecosystem

594
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,760
that was also the year after we did our

595
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,120
propaganda war series that

596
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:38,480
we were targeted first online so the

597
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:41,360
narrative

598
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,960
journalist equals criminal was seated on

599
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:45,439
social media

600
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:46,080
the next year in 2017 that same

601
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,320
narrative

602
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,158
right which i kind of sloughed off

603
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:52,158
because i thought oh my gosh

604
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,159
by next year i'll next year i'll be a

605
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:55,440
journalist for 35 years and my track

606
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:57,280
record should be okay

607
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
journalist is not equals a criminal

608
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,480
laugh laugh laugh

609
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:02,080
well you hear it a million times when

610
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,360
it's pounded a million times on social

611
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,240
media all of a sudden

612
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,840
people think maybe it's not far-fetched

613
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,159
have you heard this have you heard this

614
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:11,439
and then all of a sudden this astro

615
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:15,360
turfing bottom up

616
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,159
in 2017 was met by top down the same

617
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,918
message

618
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,600
coming from president duterte and his

619
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:22,880
state of the nation address

620
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:25,918
we just had his fifth one today but in

621
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,880
july 2017 he he said the exact same

622
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,400
thing

623
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,760
uh that then is the weaponization of

624
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:34,400
social media

625
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:35,919
in 2018 that was followed by the

626
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:39,120
weaponization of the law

627
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:41,120
journalist equals criminal i had uh 11

628
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:43,199
cases and investigations filed against

629
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:46,320
me and rappler at that point

630
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:48,159
in 2019 eight arrest warrants

631
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,678
issued i was arrested twice in a

632
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,600
five-week period

633
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:55,919
and then just a month

634
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,918
not even a month ago june 15th a

635
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,640
colleague and i a former colleague and i

636
00:21:57,919 --> 00:22:03,120
were

637
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,400
convicted for a retroactive conviction

638
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,120
for a law

639
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,760
that was uh was actually not in place

640
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:10,399
when we pulled

641
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,080
published this story in 2012 so

642
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,640
journalist equals criminal

643
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,720
this really shows you how it moves from

644
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:19,360
the seeding on social media

645
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,440
the weaponization of social media the

646
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,559
weaponization of the law

647
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,960
and then a conviction it

648
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,840
it's how we change reality finally the

649
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,000
third

650
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:32,080
part i want to do it talk to you about

651
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:34,080
is how 2020

652
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,678
has exacerbated these conditions that

653
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,399
have been going on for the last four

654
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,159
years and

655
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:44,000
of course covid19 in the philippines

656
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:47,760
this has become this is now our 19th

657
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:48,400
week in lockdown it is a security driven

658
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,039
lockdown

659
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,080
president duterte talked about some of

660
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,080
the things that

661
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,520
he had he admitted the failures in

662
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,399
dealing with some of these

663
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,600
but here's the last part that wasn't the

664
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:01,600
only thing that happened in the

665
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,639
philippines covid then

666
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:07,678
set the conditions for a consolidation

667
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:11,760
of power for the duterte administration

668
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:14,720
my conviction in june began to codify

669
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
abuses of power into law in order to

670
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,840
convict me

671
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,000
the government actually the court i'm

672
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,000
sorry had to change

673
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:24,480
the statute of limitations for libel

674
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,679
from one year to 12 years

675
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:29,919
that was followed soon after

676
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:31,520
by the shutdown the permanent shutdown

677
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:32,600
of our largest broadcaster in the

678
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:36,080
philippines

679
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:39,360
abs-cbn and that

680
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:42,080
is followed by the third part which is

681
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:43,360
codifying into law an anti-terror law

682
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,360
that was passed

683
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,639
passed through congress in just five

684
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,959
days that

685
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,080
essentially would give cabinet

686
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,640
secretaries

687
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,520
the power to designate a critic a

688
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,559
journalist

689
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,679
someone like me a terrorist and by doing

690
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,000
that

691
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,960
we can be picked up without an arrest

692
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:04,400
warrant

693
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:05,919
and a jail for up to 24 days so you can

694
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,600
see the landscape has

695
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:10,960
changed um and detect and technology

696
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,080
plays a critical role

697
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,080
in beginning this effect

698
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:19,840
this power

699
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,400
thank you so much um thank you so much

700
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:26,320
um maria i

701
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,919
really look forward to hearing more and

702
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,399
discussing more both

703
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:32,240
uh with the special rapporteur and also

704
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,000
with the minister about the situation

705
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,679
that you're currently facing i read in

706
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:39,120
one report that

707
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:40,559
if you combine all of the um the charges

708
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,959
against you and your team it would add

709
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:46,399
up to 100 years

710
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:49,919
which is kind of devastating of course

711
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,200
and and and and and i'm sure for you

712

so much for joining us from costa rica

716
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,039
as you know we were meant to be having

717
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:03,279
rights con costa rica

718
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:04,400
in your home country and thank you very

719
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:06,559
much for your support

720
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,600
in putting that event together and of

721
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:09,600
course for joining us now

722
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,879
well good morning dear writescon

723
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,720
participants i

724
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,640
extend warren greetings on behalf of the

725
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:21,679
republic of costa rica

726
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,640
as as you may remind the current edition

727
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,279
of rights council

728
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,279
was planned to be held in our country

729
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:28,080
although it unfortunately turned out to

730
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:30,799
be impossible

731
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:31,840
this time i cherish the hope that the

732
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,760
time will

733
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,279
soon come in which we will able to

734
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
resume this plan so

735
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:39,679
it will be a pleasure for us to welcome

736
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,919
you to our country

737
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,720
we are here to discuss about the topic

738
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:46,159
that

739
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:49,360
in fact should be self-evident however

740
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,520
um human race has been struggling with

741
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:53,199
issues related to human rights for

742
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:56,320
thousands of years

743
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,000
and sadly still does of course some

744
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:00,960
progress has been achieved

745
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,039
but it is also clear that we still have

746
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,799
a long way to go

747
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:06,080
on top of that we have created

748
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,158
virtuality

749
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,120
leading to a new parallel world that

750
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,520
arises

751
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:12,320
numerous questions that we are trying to

752
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,440
answer

753
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:18,559
and that will certainly bring many other

754
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:22,480
that still remain unspoken

755
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:25,279
looking back at how it all began i

756
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,000
bring you the following words of gordon

757
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,320
moore

758
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:29,039
referring to the microelectronics

759
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,840
industry

760
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:32,640
these are very interesting words for us

761
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:35,840
since i

762
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:39,520
myself i am an engineer

763
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,559
that specialist in microelectronics

764
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:45,120
so at that time gordon moore said

765
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:47,760
when when you see the numbers or hear

766
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,479
your company's name on the evening news

767
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:51,360
and you are once again reminded that

768
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,400
this is not

769
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:55,120
not sorry that this is no longer just an

770
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,840
industry

771
00:26:55,120 --> 00:27:00,239
but an economic and cultural phenomenon

772
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:04,158
a crucial force at the heart of the

773
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:07,520
modern world when we think

774
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:10,320
about virtuality now his words can be

775
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:12,080
undoubtedly applied to the virtual world

776
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,879
we are living now

777
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,678
this pandemic has accelerated the pace

778
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
at which

779
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:20,960
digitalization and virtuality is

780
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:22,240
massively expanding to every aspect of

781
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
our lives

782
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:26,159
but the truth is that we were not

783
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,760
prepared for this

784
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:31,039
we are at the beginning of legal and

785
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,600
societal discussions about virtuality

786
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:35,679
so the virtual world certainly opens

787
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,199
unprecedented opportunities

788
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,799
for effective and immediate

789
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,080
communication for the benefit of

790
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,639
humanity

791
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,879
but this is exactly why we need to

792
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,520
prevent its use as a tool for extending

793
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,279
violence

794
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:50,799
intolerance misinformation and the

795
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:54,640
perception of lack of safety

796
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,559
in 1982 in his book critical path

797
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,159
the futurist and inventor richard

798
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,600
buckminster filler

799
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:04,159
indicated that until the year 1900

800
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,678
humanity needed a century to duplicate

801
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:09,200
its knowledge

802
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:13,120
at the end of the second world war

803
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,960
it took 25 years and today we need only

804
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:17,360
13 months

805
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:18,720
ibm estimated that internet of things

806
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:20,879
would reduce the time to double the

807
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,520
amount of information generated by human

808
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,399
race in

809
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:24,960
to just 12 hours so we are living in

810
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,719
privileged

811
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,399
times of explanation advance of

812
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,399
knowledge and technology

813
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,158
and no other time in history has

814
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,158
witnessed the generation of this amount

815
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,399
of new information and knowledge

816
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:37,840
but what kind of information we want to

817
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,000
be generated

818
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,320
how much of this information refers to

819
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
us and is obtained without consent

820
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,080
how to deal with freedom of expression

821
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,158
but also with fake news and digital

822
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,399
violence

823
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,159
we have the right to be connected and

824
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,600
this is something that the pandemic

825
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:58,000
really brought as an issue how do we

826
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
ensure

827
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,600
the right of people to be connected in

828
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,240
order to continue with

829
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,918
work with their relationships with their

830
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:08,799
families their friends

831
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,399
in this stage of isolation but also

832
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:13,679
their rights to education

833
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:15,760
and to obtain information

834
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:16,880
and what about the gap in digital

835
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,960
literacy

836
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:23,600
so people also have the right to be

837
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,440
to have this digital deterrency at hand

838
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,039
and to provide the means for achieving

839
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,760
that

840
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,240
and we still we're still trying to

841
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,960
answer

842
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:35,360
very simple things like how and when i

843
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:36,000
got tracked if i never granted access to

844
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:38,240
this

845
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:40,960
and i'm trying to think here as a

846
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,440
citizen as this uh

847
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,480
citizen that faces every day these

848
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:46,720
questions

849
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:47,520
what if i was included in whatsapp group

850
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,600
i didn't

851
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:52,720
didn't want to be in shouldn't i be

852
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:56,559
asked first by the app

853
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:59,279
if i wanted to be included before i am

854
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,440
included shouldn't i have the right in

855
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:03,520
every subscription service to delete my

856
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,480
email account especially if someone else

857
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,879
use my account

858
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,159
these are very simple questions but

859
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:12,240
we're still trying

860
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,159
to to answer them

861
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,640
for the citizens and we're still trying

862
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:20,159
to provide the mechanisms for that

863
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,320
and let's imagine now about the

864
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,600
most difficult questions that we are

865
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,559
facing

866
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:27,520
that we'll still have to solve for

867
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,158
example

868
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:32,799
the legal concerns in institutions and

869
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:35,279
citizens about data sharing

870
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,240
and in in our country and probably many

871
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,279
countries

872
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:41,120
the pandemic revealed important legal

873
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,240
and procedural gaps

874
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:46,559
and people is turning to our ministry

875
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,679
to answer many of these questions and

876
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:51,120
we're specialists

877
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:53,679
in technology but that means

878
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:54,559
i mean we need people which is

879
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:59,120
specialist

880
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:02,639
also in the legal issues of technology

881
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,120
and those will not be probably not all

882
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:06,559
of them

883
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,918
would be in in our ministry and

884
00:31:06,559 --> 00:31:11,840
this also arose the questions on how

885
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:14,080
prepared we are as governments and

886
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,600
institutions to deal with this

887
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,320
and if law enforcement is difficult

888
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:22,480
in the non-virtual world how are we

889
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:24,080
going to cope with this in the virtual

890
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:26,240
world

891
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:27,918
so there are really still many things to

892
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:31,679
be solved and i am

893
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:32,399
glad that we have the opportunity to

894
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,519
discuss

895
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,120
them in this in this

896
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:41,760
conference i hope that

897
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,239
all these discussions and conversations

898
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,679
will

899
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:49,200
bring really fruitful policies

900
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,760
decisions suggestions for people

901
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,880
to help them deal with this new world

902
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,840
and also to

903
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:56,399
help governments and institutions make

904
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,519
this

905
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,320
new world a good one instead of one

906
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,039
extending

907
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:05,039
violence and intolerance and inequality

908
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,120
well um thank you so much thank you for

909
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:16,720
such a

910
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,719
honest and considered

911
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,559
perspective that you provided there

912
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,000
because i think

913
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,440
i'm sure that maria and others from

914
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,200
countries around the world don't have

915
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:28,880
ministers of technology who

916
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,120
are really thinking about the the

917
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:33,279
philosophical the political the economic

918
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:36,879
the social as well as the technical

919
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:38,480
um matters that eric played in coming to

920
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,679
some conclusions about many of the

921
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,799
decisions that are at the front of

922
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,799
governmental policy

923
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:47,918
so denzel if you don't mind i'm going to

924
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:52,080
flip back to you

925
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:54,640
and you mentioned in your report

926
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:56,000
that you actually the thematic of the

927
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:59,440
report was looking

928
00:32:56,000 --> 00:33:02,799
at the the

929
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:03,840
the racial injustice elements of

930
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,240
technology i

931
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:07,120
you you took a report as the special

932
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,919
rapporteur

933
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,000
on on racism and racial discrimination

934
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:14,159
and decided to actually focus your whole

935
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:16,960
report on technology which means that

936
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:18,720
technology really has to play a very

937
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,399
significant role or it would appear to

938
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,240
play a significant role

939
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,719
in exacerbating and compounding

940
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,640
existing inequities and i think you

941
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:32,000
identify that along a range of

942
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:34,000
lines racial ethnic national

943
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,440
so you provided a series of

944
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,120
recommendations

945
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:39,360
let's play a small game here for a

946
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:40,239
second imagine that we had mark

947
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:43,039
zuckerberg

948
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,679
on screen with us right now um what is

949
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,720
the one

950
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:48,080
thing that you would ask him to do and i

951
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:49,840
don't mean

952
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:51,760
you know a human rights impact

953
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,760
assessment of his platform i mean like

954
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,519
if you could ask him to do one thing in

955
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,879
order to alleviate some of that

956
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:59,279
exacerbation

957
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,919
on of racial injustice that you talk

958
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:02,799
about

959
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:02,799
um what would it be

960
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:07,840
so this is i mean there's so many things

961
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,399
that come to mind but i'm going to step

962
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,639
away

963
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,759
from the kind of technical impact

964
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,040
assessment style

965
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,079
uh solutions and maybe say really

966
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,879
take ownership over what kind of

967
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:22,639
um a project he is involved in you know

968
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:23,040
and and this i think applies to facebook

969
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,760
and

970
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:26,639
and many other of the big tech companies

971
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:29,040
which are

972
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:31,919
right now world making right they are

973
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,879
creating universes in which we all live

974
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:37,279
and to which we are all held captive and

975
00:34:34,879 --> 00:34:38,078
the norms that underlie the worlds that

976
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:40,560
they make

977
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:42,320
shape the way those worlds operate so

978
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,679
with facebook and many other social

979
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,079
media platforms

980
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:47,040
they've constructed their worlds around

981
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,040
norms of

982
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:51,440
free speech where free speech is

983
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,960
untethered from other kinds of norms

984
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,760
like racial justice like you know um

985
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:00,079
inclusion of other groups and once the

986
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,720
the fundamentals of how you organize the

987
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,960
platform

988
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,959
are structured around a certain type of

989
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,079
norm at the expense of another and you

990
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,480
might think about

991
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:09,920
um facebook's even it's it's business

992
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,440
model right and this is part of the big

993
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:13,680
critique with these big tech

994
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,800
corporations is that the way that they

995
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:16,960
make money

996
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
is compatible with and sometimes

997
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:20,880
benefits from

998
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:23,520
racial discrimination and racial

999
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,400
exclusion and to me that speaks to

1000
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,000
a failure to truly internalize exactly

1001
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:30,480
what kind of project

1002
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:33,040
he is he and the company isn't involved

1003
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:34,640
in and so my recommendation or the thing

1004
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:37,200
that i would ask is

1005
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:38,160
take ownership of the world that you are

1006
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,919
creating

1007
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,440
and understand that the norms that you

1008
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,960
have placed at the center

1009
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,720
are the ones that are going to be

1010
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,520
privileged and reproduced on that

1011
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,240
platform

1012
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,880
and racial justice and racial equality

1013
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:51,279
is so

1014
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,280
low on the totem pole of values that are

1015
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,920
prioritized on facebook that it's no

1016
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,760
wonder

1017
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,839
that it's doing so much harm in that

1018
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,880
space

1019
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,759
thank you um i'm not sure if i can be

1020
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,240
heard can you hear me pretend i yeah

1021
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:07,280
okay

1022
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,759
so look yeah great great great great

1023
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:11,760
thanks i mean as you say the complexity

1024
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,560
is great in the scope and scale of that

1025
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:17,680
particular platform is so large

1026
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:19,200
and if you de-prioritize or de-emphasize

1027
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:21,919
the issues of racial

1028
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:23,680
justice or racial identity they end up

1029
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,720
being caught up in this i guess this

1030
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,720
maelstrom of

1031
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:27,839
replication of what we've seen offline

1032
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:29,439
and also

1033
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:31,279
an amplification of what we've seen

1034
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,599
offline but it's not just the tech

1035
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,720
platforms like facebook that are

1036
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:36,960
important here

1037
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:38,879
it's all of the like you look at every

1038
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:40,000
single tech company every single company

1039
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:42,079
it's now a tech company

1040
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,599
regardless of what they sell and i think

1041
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:45,680
you've also identified that

1042
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:47,119
in the report that it's you know it's

1043
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:49,040
it's it's about

1044
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:50,880
um it's about the human embedded

1045
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,720
technologies like pacemakers it's about

1046
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,880
predictive technology

1047
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,160
of policing it's about the skewed data

1048
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,880
sets that determine

1049
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,680
the likelihood of employment or social

1050
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:04,320
welfare it's now about the tracing apps

1051
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,560
um so this is not just a tech platform

1052
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:07,520
issue it's also a ministerial it's a

1053
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,000
government issue

1054
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,680
and you know as a the special rapporteur

1055
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,119
you report to member states you actually

1056
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:15,279
have a minister here

1057
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,440
of technology on the line now i don't

1058
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:19,119
want you to reflect upon costa rica's

1059
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,280
uh tech you know sort of tech framework

1060
00:37:19,119 --> 00:37:22,240
but as a minister as a minister of

1061
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,599
technology

1062
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,399
and it was very interesting what she

1063
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,640
said actually about her ministry being

1064
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,240
asked for solutions that had been

1065
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,560
actually just looking at technology but

1066
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,759
now it's across the whole spectrum

1067
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:36,000
what is what is what would you suggest

1068
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:39,040
to

1069
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:40,320
ministers of technology um in terms of

1070
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,200
governmental policy

1071
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:44,560
to to put in place to not exacerbate

1072
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,000
some of that discrimination or

1073
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,960
racial injustice that we're seeing in

1074
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:51,359
the online environment

1075
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,560
thanks so i would say uh two things and

1076
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:54,400
the report actually

1077
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:56,240
the number of recommendations for for

1078
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:57,760
member states and i would encourage the

1079
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,598
member states to read the reports

1080
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:01,200
because detailed recommendations

1081
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:02,800
but i would say two things i want to

1082
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,680
highlight here one is

1083
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,280
where is the law so we have existing

1084
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,960
human rights frameworks

1085
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:11,040
including around racial justice and

1086
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
racial inequality there's a very robust

1087
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:14,640
anti-racism framework

1088
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:16,480
that exists at the international level

1089
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,078
and that most governments have actually

1090
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:20,000
signed up to but you don't

1091
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:22,079
see the international convention for the

1092
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:24,079
elimination of racial discrimination

1093
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:25,599
really dealt with in tech conversations

1094
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,480
whether it's about how governments are

1095
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,400
structuring

1096
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,680
their technological responses or how

1097
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,359
they're regulating

1098
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,960
private government so i would say where

1099
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:34,960
where are you using where is the law

1100
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,359
being applied is it being taken

1101
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:39,839
seriously as a resource and then to

1102
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:41,598
close the gap between general principles

1103
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,078
and concrete recommendations because i

1104
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:44,400
think

1105
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:46,240
the minister really highlighted how you

1106
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,320
can have general principles but what do

1107
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,479
they mean at the granular level

1108
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,079
i would ask states who are the experts

1109
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,000
that you're consulting so one of the

1110
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,440
things that came up in the production of

1111
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,599
this report is how

1112
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,560
you know the engineers the the tech

1113
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:00,160
companies

1114
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,078
have government's ears but the

1115
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,240
communities that are most directly

1116
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,520
impacted especially racially ethnically

1117
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,000
marginalized

1118
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:10,000
groups aren't necessarily treated as

1119
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,839
experts who might provide

1120
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:13,599
detailed information about how the law

1121
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:14,000
should protect them and i think what's

1122
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,920
happening

1123
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,119
right now when we see the uprisings on

1124
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:19,520
the streets is

1125
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:20,720
people who are impacted by oppressive

1126
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,960
technology saying

1127
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,078
here's what it would take to actually

1128
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,240
give meaning

1129
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,839
to human rights principles that exist so

1130
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,598
it would be a call to say

1131
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,440
where is the law and who are your

1132
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,240
experts and can you use

1133
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:36,240
people who are most directly impacted as

1134
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,040
experts on how the law might better

1135
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,399
protect

1136
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:42,480
against some of the most frightening

1137
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,800
dimensions of what we're seeing

1138
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:45,920
thank you and and i think maria to bring

1139
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:48,880
you in here like

1140
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,440
it's clear that you are in a sense one

1141
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,640
of the

1142
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,240
the kind of victims here of of this

1143
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,160
maybe it's not a racial justice issue

1144
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,919
but it's certainly a political

1145
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,759
opinion issue and you know you've worked

1146
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,839
tirelessly to hold the line

1147
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,359
against the administration and to expose

1148
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,680
the truth as you said

1149
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:11,680
to get fact out there to demand the

1150
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:13,520
right to report

1151
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,520
i think you even said at one point the

1152
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,920
freedom of the press is the foundation

1153
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,000
of

1154
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:19,680
every single right that we have as

1155
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:22,319
citizens

1156
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:24,560
do you have a perspective on the future

1157
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,759
of fresh predator of press freedom in

1158
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,520
the digital age like

1159
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,160
where do you think this is going

1160
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:31,599
globally and it's also relates to the

1161
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,839
role of course of the

1162
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:34,880
platforms which now in a sense

1163
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:36,799
publishers

1164
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,119
um you know they're pro the ones that

1165
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:41,200
are actually often the gateway

1166
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,480
um or the roadblock to that sort of

1167
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,279
information that you're trying to

1168
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,280
publish so

1169
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,319
you know friend and foe let's hear from

1170
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,200
you about you your perspective

1171
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:51,520
first can i take it's a great question

1172
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,399
but

1173
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:55,920
i'm going to tie up racial justice or

1174
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,000
injustice with

1175
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,960
the social media platforms because in

1176
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,079
the end

1177
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:06,160
these are all connected right um the

1178
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:07,280
so from from the design perspective part

1179
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:10,399
of the problem

1180
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:13,440
is that facts the way

1181
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,359
the foundation of of how we communicate

1182
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,000
to each other about what the world looks

1183
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:19,759
like

1184
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,040
is now being delivered by a system

1185
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:26,560
that is actually manipulative

1186
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:28,319
or is used in a manipulative manner

1187
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,400
so the first one is if you look at the

1188
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:32,400
design of social media platforms

1189
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:35,520
there's one thing they all have in

1190
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,640
common which is built into the design

1191
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:39,119
is actually the ability to tear society

1192
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,359
apart

1193
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:44,319
it's and it's one coding decision that

1194
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:47,440
was made

1195
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,640
for growth of the platform and that idea

1196
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,839
is to use

1197
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,759
to recommend to each of us to allow

1198
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:56,400
growth for our networks and for the

1199
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:59,520
social media platforms this idea of

1200
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:00,960
friends of friends right if you go back

1201
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:03,440
to like the

1202
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,800
granovetter this paper on the strength

1203
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,280
of weak ties

1204
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,359
we form these clusters but social media

1205
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,000
platforms take it a step further

1206
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:13,240
instead of six degrees of separation

1207
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,640
facebook will have

1208
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:19,118
4.7 degrees of separation because

1209
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,440
they recommend friends of friends right

1210
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:22,240
the problem with recommending friends of

1211
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,520
friends

1212
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,160
is that let's just say you start here um

1213
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,160
and we can take something like there's a

1214
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,920
film that was out in sundance called

1215
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,480
coded bias where people just can't the

1216
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:38,480
programmers had built something where

1217
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:41,119
they a black person just

1218
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:42,240
couldn't see themselves in artificial

1219
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,720
intelligence right so

1220
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:46,479
let me show you an example of how this

1221
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,879
friends of friends works

1222
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:51,119
let's talk about here in the philippines

1223
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,920
pro duterte anti-duterte if at the

1224
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,640
beginning

1225
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:56,480
we all started in the center where we

1226
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:59,680
agreed on a set of facts

1227
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,000
all of the pro-duterte people would

1228
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,040
be the engine of recommendation would

1229
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,960
say well

1230
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,200
here bring friends of friends in and

1231
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:09,440
they will move further here

1232
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,520
at the same time they will see far less

1233
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,400
of the anti-duterte opinions

1234
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:15,119
because they are moving further here and

1235
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,319
then they move

1236
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:19,440
further as as the platform grows because

1237
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,400
the recommendation

1238
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:23,520
engine builds in extremism and

1239
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:26,400
radicalization

1240
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,599
and here we have a completely gutted

1241
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,400
public sphere

1242
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,880
right so if you think about this it

1243
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,680
really

1244
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:35,520
is a governance issue because facts

1245
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:38,078
should not be debatable

1246
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:39,599
facts should be in protected in the

1247
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:40,000
public sphere and that brings it to

1248
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,440
press

1249
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:45,440
freedom journalists are the gatekeepers

1250
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:47,119
the facts or we were for a very long

1251
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:50,480
period of time we no longer

1252
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:52,079
are tech has taken distribution of news

1253
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:53,280
the world's largest distributor of news

1254
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,800
is facebook

1255
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:56,960
and yet they've abdicated the

1256
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,760
responsibility

1257
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:00,079
of protecting the public sphere so if we

1258
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,400
all

1259
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:03,760
no longer believe in facts you can take

1260
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,839
this thing again and make it be

1261
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,200
left and right in the united states

1262
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:10,640
right or

1263
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:12,799
how about disinformation attacks

1264
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,000
influence operations against americans

1265
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:17,359
that target

1266
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,680
black lives matter on both sides

1267
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:22,319
this is proven in 19 2016 elections

1268
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:24,240
right

1269
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:25,359
and then you just fast forward when you

1270
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:28,399
don't actually

1271
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:31,759
stop it when you continue to let it

1272
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,000
happen it that the goal of influence

1273
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,440
operations is to change the way real

1274
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,160
people think

1275
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,079
and act and that's what we've seen

1276
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,240
pounded for four years

1277
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,079
and this is why we are where we are

1278
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,078
today

1279
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:47,599
and and and do you think and and i've

1280
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:49,359
seen yes

1281
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:50,960
it's clear i have so many follow-ups for

1282
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,000
you but i i've got we've got a little

1283
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,599
bit of time but

1284
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:58,640
but the the question then

1285
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,920
i think it relates to um

1286
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,960
are we actually seeing the internet

1287
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:07,680
um as a hindrance as a direct

1288
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:09,119
hindrance to democracy an enabler of

1289
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:10,720
autocracy

1290
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:12,960
i mean is that the experience as a

1291
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:15,919
result of all of this division and

1292
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:18,079
and and and and at the same time i mean

1293
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:20,079
the internet has actually been the it's

1294
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:21,280
been your mouthpiece it's enabled raptor

1295
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:22,960
to communicate

1296
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:24,880
with you know a million out of 10

1297
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,720
million uh citizens

1298
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:28,000
in a way that like you would not have

1299
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,799
been able to do i think through

1300
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,119
traditional

1301
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,880
traditional media so there's this like

1302
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,560
this incredible enabler and at the same

1303
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:36,000
time it's probably going to be the cause

1304
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,000
of your detainment

1305
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,440
um and and and perhaps you're the

1306
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,599
personification of this

1307
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:46,480
you know this kind of eccentric um um

1308
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,520
bipolar experience that we're having of

1309
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,520
the internet

1310
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,280
and should we be advocating like how

1311
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:53,040
should we be advocating to protect that

1312
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,359
open rights respecting internet going

1313
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,359
forward

1314
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,000
wow that's a tough that's a lot of

1315
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:06,160
yes absolutely this is destroying the

1316
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,280
public sphere

1317
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,160
as it is right now and secondly there

1318
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,520
has to be

1319
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,240
some governance in this because

1320
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:16,640
self-regulation for tech

1321
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:19,200
platforms have not worked this is part

1322
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,920
of the reason you look from 2017

1323
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:22,640
until today all of the research has

1324
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,880
shown

1325
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,879
that cheap armies on social media are

1326
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:28,560
rolling back democracy it is playing to

1327
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:31,119
the worst of human nature

1328
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,279
and there is no protection for users

1329
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,920
this is part of the problem right

1330
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,560
um what about the frontliners the

1331
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:40,720
journalists the human rights activists

1332
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:42,319
uh opposition politicians in the

1333
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,480
philippines so um

1334
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:46,079
number one it has gotten worse number

1335
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:48,160
two uh

1336
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:49,280
i don't think we throw the baby out with

1337
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:51,440
the bathwater

1338
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,359
and there are lots of solutions that can

1339
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:56,240
that we can talk about right

1340
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:57,440
uh a lot lots of books have been written

1341
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,919
um

1342
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:01,119
uh chris wiley the cambridge analytical

1343
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,920
whistleblower says

1344
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:04,640
well why not have building codes for

1345
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:07,040
tech

1346
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,879
right individual coders are going to

1347
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:11,920
have to sign building codes like

1348
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,160
building codes for buildings but

1349
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:15,839
the second one is there's actually a

1350
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,879
very interesting book coming out in

1351
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:19,839
september

1352
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:22,480
cena neural at mit recommends that it

1353
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:23,599
starts with protecting the users first

1354
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:26,240
right so

1355
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,000
data portability social network

1356
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,959
portability these are some of the things

1357
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,440
because if you do

1358
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,720
that there you give the networks the

1359
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:36,240
social media platforms

1360
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:38,319
incentive to protect the users um

1361
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,359
regulation is gonna have part of it and

1362
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:41,920
for anyone

1363
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,400
fighting for the internet that's a

1364
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:46,480
difficult thing who gets to decide this

1365
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,240
i'll say the person you know mark

1366
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:48,880
zuckerberg will always say you don't

1367
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,839
want us

1368
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,040
determining uh what should be censored

1369
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:55,599
but you know that's just

1370
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,240
a wrong understanding of what censorship

1371
00:47:55,599 --> 00:47:58,559
is

1372
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,439
because in the end as it stands right

1373
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:03,280
now

1374
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,800
these platforms are already censoring

1375
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,079
they're already determining which

1376
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:13,599
speech gets the widest distribution

1377
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,319
and right now lies laced with anger and

1378
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:16,880
hate

1379
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:19,680
spread faster and further than really

1380
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:19,680
boring facts

1381
00:48:19,839 --> 00:48:24,400
thank you and you raised the issue maria

1382
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:26,960
a number of times around governance and

1383
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,720
and which is the perfect segue for me to

1384
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:30,480
to approach the minister

1385
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:32,078
whose responsibility actually is

1386
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:35,760
governance within

1387
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:39,040
the costa rica um um

1388
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:42,240
jurisdiction and so let me ask you

1389
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:43,839
minister like you know you're an expert

1390
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:46,160
on nanotechnology

1391
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,680
um the smallest of technologies where

1392
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:48,000
we're now seeing the technology is

1393
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,558
having

1394
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,160
such a large impact you know what do you

1395
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:53,599
think about the role of government in

1396
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,359
regulating tech it's really

1397
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:57,520
one of the series the most significant

1398
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:58,720
questions of our time which is like

1399
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:00,559
you know there's been calls from

1400
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,000
microsoft and others to

1401
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:04,400
read it for government to regulate

1402
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:06,559
facial recognition should

1403
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:08,079
should should governments now be taking

1404
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:10,400
a stronger hand in this

1405
00:49:08,079 --> 00:49:11,839
and and and real quick if you're if

1406
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,240
you're comfortable to answer this it's

1407
00:49:11,839 --> 00:49:14,160
like

1408
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,000
should the tech companies be broken up

1409
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,118
and due to their oversized

1410
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,119
impact on society

1411
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,799
well uh one of the most difficult things

1412
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:28,319
on technology right now is that

1413
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:31,280
we are um we are creating technology

1414
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:31,599
that is bringing issues that we still do

1415
00:49:31,280 --> 00:49:36,079
not

1416
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:38,319
know and uh it's like trying to

1417
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,599
to look into the future and imagine what

1418
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:42,558
could happen

1419
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:44,160
and if you think about microelectronics

1420
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:47,359
something that started

1421
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,480
in in in a lab with um

1422
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:54,240
let's say a device like this size

1423
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:58,240
now is uh or maybe like this

1424
00:49:54,240 --> 00:50:01,839
now it's uh really

1425
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:05,439
bringing us to unprecedented

1426
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:10,240
um not only a computational powered

1427
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:14,319
but also unprecedented consequences

1428
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:16,200
because it also um let's say it also

1429
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:17,839
it gave a lot of impulse to

1430
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:20,960
telecommunications and it

1431
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:23,040
it made the world we are having now in

1432
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,640
which a message whether it is good or

1433
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,558
bad is spread

1434
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:28,640
immediately all over the world and that

1435
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:31,119
is something no one could have predicted

1436
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,319
before or if we think about the

1437
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:35,760
possibilities of

1438
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,720
miniaturizing devices and what could be

1439
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:39,359
achieved in terms of recognition of

1440
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,640
people

1441
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:43,680
and uh trade tracking and many other

1442
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,520
things

1443
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:47,279
it's really difficult to imagine what

1444
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,160
will happen with technology and that

1445
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,839
about thing

1446
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:51,920
that only thinking about technology

1447
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,839
already existing what about

1448
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,319
the possibilities for example of quantum

1449
00:50:53,839 --> 00:51:00,640
technology

1450
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:04,319
quantum computation however i do think

1451
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:09,279
that companies and governments

1452
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:12,319
should really try to raise awareness

1453
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,440
on what technology might bring even if

1454
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:16,480
at this moment will

1455
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,319
seem like science fiction yes we

1456
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,640
cannot wait until the technology is

1457
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:24,160
bringing these effects in our lives to

1458
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:26,640
say okay now what

1459
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:27,839
it will be too late so i think uh

1460
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:31,118
companies and

1461
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:33,839
engineers and also people

1462
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,800
taking decisions in this business but

1463
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,119
also

1464
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,119
if we think about advocates if we think

1465
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,920
about um

1466
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:43,440
decision makers they also have some

1467
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,280
awareness of technology the new

1468
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,920
possibilities but also on

1469
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:48,400
how this will reflect in society and how

1470
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,240
this

1471
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:55,920
could be brought to

1472
00:51:52,240 --> 00:52:00,160
let's say to legal security for people

1473
00:51:55,920 --> 00:52:03,040
to really rules will be able to adapt to

1474
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,040
the current technology

1475
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:06,640
thank you minister i would like to i

1476
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,400
wish we had more time i would like to

1477
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:10,240
delve more deeply into this question

1478
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:11,760
on on governance and who has

1479
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:12,558
responsibility because there are many

1480
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,240
questions

1481
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:16,160
that you as a minister and i think many

1482
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,598
ministers around the world are facing

1483
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:19,359
bringing up some very difficult

1484
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:20,880
questions around

1485
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:22,400
you know the regulation of the tech

1486
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,319
sector but also like how are you

1487
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:25,520
addressing the privacy concerns of

1488
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,119
tracing apps

1489
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:29,839
how are you dealing with freedom of

1490
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:31,680
expression for your citizens versus

1491
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,880
the challenges of misinformation and

1492
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:34,319
hate speech online

1493
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,319
these are some of these very difficult

1494
00:52:34,319 --> 00:52:38,960
questions that the governance

1495
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,839
needs to come from the state as well as

1496
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:41,680
input from

1497
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,040
the tech sector and responsibility and

1498
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:45,118
ownership by the tech sector

1499
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:46,880
and of course hopefully guidance by

1500
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:47,599
civil society many of whom are here

1501
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:50,160
today

1502
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,880
with that um please join me in thanking

1503
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:53,359
our panel

1504
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,040
uh i think we've opened up a number of

1505
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,440
pandora boxes for discussion

1506
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,960
over the coming five days and over to

1507
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:02,079
nikki gladstone who

1508
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:04,160
is the director of this

1509
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:06,000
extraordinary event and will help us to

1510
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:08,240
provide us with some further information

1511
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,559
about how to successfully navigate

1512
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:12,160
this complex and interesting program and

1513
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:13,680
before that i just want to also

1514
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,000
say thank you very much to our sponsors

1515
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:18,078
who have moved with us from

1516
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,280
writescon from being an offline event to

1517
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:20,960
being an online event

1518
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:22,960
i don't think we lost one sponsor in the

1519
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,200
transition some from companies some from

1520
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:27,040
governments some from ministries

1521
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:43,839
some from foundations thank you very

1522
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:43,839
much for your support nikki over to you

1523
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,000
hey nikki i think you might be on mute

1524
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:26,559
so maybe we can get you off viewed and

1525
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:30,000
bring you back onto the screen

know how to set up your profile and time

1545
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,879
zone

1546
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,240
how to understand the program and really

1547
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:11,280
build an agenda

1548
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:12,720
and just on the note of the agenda um i

1549
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:14,480
wanted to say a big thank you to all of

1550
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,279
the session organizers who came on this

1551
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,559
journey with us

1552
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,559
and did an incredible job at

1553
00:55:16,559 --> 00:55:20,319
transitioning the program this year

1554
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:22,000
and you can really see it in the quality

1555
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,240
of the agenda

1556
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,319
part of transitioning that program meant

1557
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:28,160
adapting our session formats so you will

1558
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,359
see many pre-recorded lightning talks

1559
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:32,240
and tech demos

1560
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:34,319
you'll see panels and fireside chats and

1561
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,279
a lot of strategy sessions and community

1562
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,520
labs

1563
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,520
and i just wanted to make a note on the

1564
00:55:37,520 --> 00:55:42,000
sessions that have caps which are the

1565
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:44,720
strategy sessions and community labs

1566
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,640
um so there's over you know 7 800

1567
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,480
participants registered to the event and

1568
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,118
so there may be sessions at any given

1569
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,440
time

1570
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,680
that you don't get into because of that

1571
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:55,119
cap and so we just want to you know

1572
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,879
make sure that you're pointed in the

1573
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:58,480
direction that at any given time there

1574
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:00,240
will always be sessions happening that

1575
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:02,160
have unlimited capacity so

1576
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:03,839
even if you don't get your first choice

1577
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,640
this program is incredible and we're

1578
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,558

you will find other other sessions that

1580
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:11,440

1581
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,799

1582
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:14,799
platform for all of us

1583
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:16,480
and for many of you it might take a

1584
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:18,720
moment to get comfortable

1585
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,520

a safety line as well and the last thing

1593
