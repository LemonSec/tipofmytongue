can you hear me yes yes

114
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,599
yes so i'm in new zealand right now

115
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,638
so i think last week

116
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:53,360
was the last chapter of

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,680
this journey so it's finished but i

118
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,600
think

119
00:04:53,680 --> 00:05:00,720
still i have some difficulty

120
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,080
times uh we will

121
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,560
have an election in new zealand in 50

122
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,599
days

123
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,960
and unfortunately the opposition party

124
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:15,520
my case so now there is a political

125
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,440
debate about

126
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:22,639
my journey to new zealand so we will see

127
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,400
but my story finished and but

128
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,680
unfortunately people

129
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,280
always i mean the media

130
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:35,680
reduce uh my word

131
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,679
to only writing a book and in

132
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,960
or they reduce my words to

133
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,440
a like a personal story yeah my story is

134
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,638
not a personal story

135
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:52,000
and i always

136
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,240
have been writing or fighting to

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,120
challenge this system the whole system

138
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,400
so

139
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:01,919
it is not a personal story

140
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:06,799
so but unfortunately the media they

141
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,799
always reduce uh things i'm so sorry to

142
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,800
hear that but we're so grateful to have

143
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:11,600
you to talk about these things and also

144
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,520
to continue

145
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:18,639
advocating um oranjeon how are you doing

146
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,960
just checking in on you as well thank

147
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:21,680
you

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,680
thanks for the introduction um uh thank

149
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,240
you of course for the invitation to be

150
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,639
here

151
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,919
um i'm also really happy that um

152
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,639
bethesda

153
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,440
has an opportunity to plan his future

154
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,360
and i think

155
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:35,280
what he said was really beautiful about

156
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,080
the fact that

157
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,799
his story has come to an end but but

158
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,719
also i think it was important that he

159
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,639
indicated that this is not a personal

160
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,720
story this is a story about

161
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,199
a whole system that's affecting people

162
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:51,759
all over the world and as we speak

163
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,120
there are still people in papua new

164
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,240
guinea in nauru

165
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:57,199
and in christmas island and in detention

166
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
centers

167
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,039
on the australian mainland who are

168
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,199
suffering from that system

169
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,280
so this is a good opportunity to raise

170
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,800
more awareness and hopefully to initiate

171
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,198
action

172
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,880
wonderful thank you both so i'll just

173
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,639
get to some of the questions we have

174
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,800
here and hopefully we can discuss

175
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,400
more of this too just for some

176
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
background um

177
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,758
where's you left around due to your

178
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,318
activism

179
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
and journalism how did your journey take

180
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:26,240
you to manas

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,919
and i and in that i think you can also

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,199
encapsulate how the journey of many

183
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:33,520
people took them to madness

184
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,720
yeah i think you know i have answered

185
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,919
this question

186
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,120
one million times over the past six

187
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,639
years

188
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:45,840
uh yeah it is a you know

189
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:49,599
i in iran i was working

190
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,520
mostly as a cultural activist

191
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:57,120
so i can't say that i am

192
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,960
so i'm kurdish but in i am

193
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:04,960
like a minority in

194
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:07,039
kurdistan because in my place in

195
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,638
the place that i was born in ilan

196
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,400
province

197
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,919
ilan province is a one of the

198
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,198
four kurdish provinces in iran

199
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:22,318
but uh ila is like uh

200
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,599
you know you know we didn't have a big

201
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:26,800
role

202
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:30,719
in the history of uh political

203
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,760
and cultural movement in kurdistan

204
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,919
and that's why i think it's very

205
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:39,200
interesting in some ways

206
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:42,240
that someone from you know

207
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:45,839
the elam province uh

208
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,120
talk about uh the political movement of

209
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:50,640
kurdistan

210
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,440
so we were like minority in ilam too

211
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,839
because most of people assimilated to

212
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
the

213
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:05,279
farsi culture and that's why we were

214
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:06,839
very active i and some of my friends and

215
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,920
colleagues who

216
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,519
actually promote kurdish culture there

217
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:16,719
and prevent

218
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,920
this kind of assimilation

219
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:23,200
and so we were very active in that

220
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,719
province for almost a decade and

221
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:29,920
finally yeah uh

222
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:33,600
the iranian

223
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,439
intelligence service or seppa

224
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:40,000
pastanam so they uh

225
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,240
attacked our office and they arrested

226
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
some of my colleagues so that ended up

227
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:46,320
in my

228
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:51,279
journey so i had to leave iran

229
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:54,720
so i went to indonesia i was there for

230
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,760
two or three months then i went to

231
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,120
australia by boat but

232
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:03,680
our boat was sang

233
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,320
and that's why they arrested us they

234
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,399
took us

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,519
off water they put me in the jail in

236
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
indonesia then i

237
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:12,880
escaped and i went back to australia

238
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:16,959
again after two weeks

239
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,839
and when i arrived in australia they

240
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,920
uh i don't want to create drama around

241
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,440
my history that that is one of my

242
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,719
biggest problem with the mainstream

243
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:27,920
media they always

244
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,399
try to create drama around my

245
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,079
story but really when i arrived in

246
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:37,360
australia it was my birthday

247
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:37,359
on 23 july and they

248
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:45,200
yeah they exiled me to manus island

249
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,640
so i was there for six years and finally

250
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:51,680
i ended up in new zealand and on

251
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,880
my birthday on 23 july

252
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,640
just three days ago five days i don't

253
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,000
know a week ago

254
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:02,880
i was accepted as a refugee

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,519
so it's finished so i was arrested on my

256
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,360
birthday

257
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,519
and i was i was uh believed on my

258
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,160
birthday yeah which is interesting

259
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,959
so it is my whole story but i'm really

260
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:16,319
tired of this

261
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:20,560
story because i have to say that

262
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:21,839
a lot and people always ask me this

263
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,880
question

264
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
and it's really difficult that you

265
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:28,800
[Music]

266
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:32,880
talk about the part of your

267
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,000
particular part of your life many times

268
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:39,279
so but now it's finished

269
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,600
so now i'm in new zealand and you know i

270
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:46,399
explained that i described it in my book

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,720
no friend but the mountains and in other

272
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:48,720
words

273
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,560
thank you and that's that's uh that's

274
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
always been an interesting story to

275
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
always hear and it encapsulates the

276
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,959
journey of so many people especially

277
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,320
from iran

278
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,880
that try and leave um repressive regimes

279
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:12,000
or their own situations to try and

280
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:16,079
gain refuge elsewhere and end up being

281
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:19,680
prisoned anew um i just in terms of the

282
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:23,040
kind of full infrastructure of the

283
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,519
australian immigration policy and how

284
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,599
manus was created and those offshore

285
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,519
prisms were created and what happened

286
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,680
i wanted to jump to you oh my john can

287
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:34,959
you give a bit of an outline of

288
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:38,239
how this has been implemented

289
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,719
and what's happening right now

290
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,519
sure that's a really important question

291
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,120
and i think um

292
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,120
a lot of these issues will become

293
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:48,480
clearer a lot of um

294
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,680
the problems the

295
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
different forms of oppression that

296
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,439
refugees have been facing in australia

297
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:57,040
will become clearer once we take a

298
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,839
historical approach but i think there

299
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,399
are

300
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,800
two different approaches historically to

301
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:06,160
take to this issue the first one

302
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,160
is to look at the detention industry and

303
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:10,639
border politics in australia

304
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:12,319
um as it has taken shape over the last

305
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,800
few decades and the other one

306
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,959
is to think about border politics in

307
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:20,000
australia

308
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:24,479
in immigration in general by taking

309
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:26,720
a longer view that contextualizes it in

310
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,600
within the history of colonization so

311
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,880
the the first

312
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:31,920
the first approach is um i think it's

313
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,320
important to

314
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:35,680
to point out that uh mandatory

315
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,880
indefinite detention

316
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,560
in australia began in the early 80s and

317
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,160
that was actually with the labour party

318
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:45,199
the labor party brought that

319
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:47,519
um uh brought in that policy

320
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:50,160
uh not the conservatives but um but it's

321
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:50,800
been taken over by the conservatives and

322
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,480
then as

323
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:57,760
um power um shifted back and forth

324
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,480
um the the policies became even more

325
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:02,800
brutal

326
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,839
uh even more draconian and

327
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,599
and i think it was it was in the early

328
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:12,800
90s sorry it was uh early 2000s 2001

329
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:15,440
that manus island and nauru two

330
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,880
former colonies of australia were set up

331
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,639
as offshore

332
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
uh detention centers they call them

333
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,839
processing centers

334
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,599
but in fact uh this has been one of the

335
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,240
things that bethesda's challenges in his

336
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,639
work

337
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,440
uh for people who have been locked up

338
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
there

339
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,360
these are not processing centers no one

340
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,680
is being processed there there's no

341
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,120
system in place uh in fact people are

342
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,000
there to be punished

343
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:39,279
um and these places are used these sites

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,160
are used as a form of

345
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,050
deterrence to make the situation so

346
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,760
horrible that people um

347
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,880
[Music]

348
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:50,319
either agreed to go back to their their

349
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,680
countries are they forced to go back to

350
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,160
the countries they fled

351
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,839
or they um they perish which has been

352
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,920
the case

353
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
unfortunately for quite a large number

354
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,519
of people

355
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
um and this is in addition the the

356
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,720
offshore centers uh

357
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,720
uh detention centers are in addition to

358
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,880
the detention centers in the mainland of

359
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,720
australia and also on christmas island

360
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,079
which is part of australian territory

361
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:15,440
but is is an island

362
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,319
off the coast um uh neat close to

363
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,720
indonesia

364
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
now this is this has been the situation

365
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,560
since the early 80s as i mentioned

366
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,480
mandatory indefinite detention

367
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,560
but and and that only applies to people

368
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,120
who have come to australia by boat

369
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,199
um coming by airplane to australia

370
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,920
seeking asylum once arriving by plane in

371
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,319
australia

372
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,000
the treatment is completely different so

373
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,800
there's a particular kind of political

374
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,920
project

375
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,880
around people who come to seek asylum by

376
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:44,560
boat

377
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:47,600
and and um and and so again to to

378
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:50,560
emphasize the the uh

379
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,199
policy or the the project that um is

380
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,599
designed

381
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,399
to deter people from seeking asylum in

382
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
australia

383
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,759
that's that's been the main goal and

384
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,800
also it's been uh

385
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:02,720
um central to election campaigns in

386
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:04,639
australia in so many ways

387
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:06,639
election campaigns kind of revolve

388
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:08,639
around um

389
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:10,560
issues around the border uh issues

390
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:13,199
around um people seeking asylum

391
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:14,638
particularly by boat but the the second

392
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,479
the second point very quickly

393
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,639
is to think about what's happening in

394
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,839
australia in terms of border politics

395
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,639
uh in the context of the history of

396
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:26,880
colonialism and if we go

397
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:27,360
back um before before the 80s it was

398
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
only

399
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,600
in the 70s that australia's white

400
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,560
australia policy was officially

401
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,759
abolished

402
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,319
um so you know this um

403
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:38,800
this locking up of people seeking asylum

404
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,240
came

405
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:43,040
very soon after australia had a a very

406
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,120
racist

407
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
immigration policy so we can see some

408
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:49,920
continuities there already

409
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:51,199
but going back further it was in the 60s

410
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,719
that australia

411
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,599
um started locking up um west papuan

412
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,639
refugees

413
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:00,160
who crossed the border into what you

414
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:03,360
know now is papua new guinea

415
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:06,240
and exiled them to manas island

416
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,280
going further back australia also

417
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:10,160
detained

418
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,918
um people without charge during the

419
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,400
first and second world war

420
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:15,439
uh people who had associated with

421
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,600
fascism um

422
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,039
but of course some of these these people

423
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,599
had very uh

424
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:23,359
no links to um to political

425
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:23,918
organizations or political movements

426
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:25,359
abroad

427
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,679
and some of them were even born in

428
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:29,360
australia but we could keep going back

429
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,840
even further but i think it's central

430
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,120
here

431
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,600
to identify the fact that australia was

432
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,799
set up

433
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,000
by the british empire over 200 years ago

434
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:41,120
as a penal colony

435
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:44,240
and this project this um

436
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,399
this colonial project to set up

437
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:48,960
prisons and to multiply and replicate

438
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,799
prisons has become part of its identity

439
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,000
and we can see that now with what's

440
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:54,559
happening and

441
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:56,400
if something isn't done to stop this

442
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,440
something isn't going to challenge

443
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:01,360
and dismantle this um this system we can

444
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,000
see that happening over and over again

445
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,159
and

446
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,919
in particular within australian society

447
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,679
as well uh to its own citizens

448
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,960
wonderful thank you so much for giving

449
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,360
that outline

450
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,000
but who is you spoke to me about this

451
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,399
concept

452
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,840
of it being this colonial project that

453
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,919
it definitely is

454
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,360
and you i reminded me that you

455
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,799
definitely wanted to talk about the

456
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:26,000
impact on the islanders

457
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:26,480
in png that these detention centers have

458
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
had

459
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:30,480
and do you want to tell us a bit more

460
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,559
about that the impact on their lives

461
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,200
that you also witnessed and everybody

462
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:38,559
else witnessed

463
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:43,120
yeah i think uh the forgotten

464
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:47,200
part of this exile policy

465
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:47,520
is indigenous people in manus island and

466
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,960
in

467
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:54,840
papua new guinea in nauru and

468
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,520
the whole region i mean the whole

469
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,039
pacific

470
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,600
islands countries so i think it is the

471
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:04,320
most

472
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,879
forgotten part of this exile policy

473
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:08,240
because

474
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,760
uh on base of my experience

475
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,360
as a person who was working in manus

476
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,520
island

477
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,000
uh the humanitarian organizations

478
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:20,000
always

479
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,880
were talking about the refugees and

480
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:28,320
of course it was right they had to talk

481
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,360
about the refugees

482
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,120
who were stuck there and

483
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:39,520
also uh the media

484
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:42,559
the media only focused on the refugees

485
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,440
and no one talk about the

486
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:47,120
local people and indigenous people there

487
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:50,480
and how this

488
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:53,678
policy uh negatively

489
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:56,190
impact on those islands

490
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,600
and for me as a person with

491
00:19:56,190 --> 00:20:00,720
[Music]

492
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:05,760
you know with indigenous background

493
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,880
as a court i think it was very clear

494
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:12,400
that we are facing

495
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:15,840
like a narrative which is

496
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:19,360
wrong you know so these people

497
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:20,639
were forgotten so in manus island the

498
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:23,918
population

499
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:27,679
is the 43 000

500
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:30,480
people in the island so

501
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,679
and really on that time uh probably the

502
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,520
only person

503
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:38,960
who was sometimes tried to

504
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,760
raise that issue was me and omit and

505
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,039
just

506
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:46,559
really some few people

507
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:50,158
and always our voice was

508
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,200
you know wasn't here

509
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:54,480
by the media but i tried really to raise

510
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,000
this issue and

511
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
write about it and sometimes write some

512
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:03,360
particular

513
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:07,200
article about this but uh generally

514
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:10,959
you know if we look at this policy

515
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,400
they spend uh nine billion dollars

516
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:18,159
on this policy i mean border protection

517
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:20,640
policy in australia so they spend some

518
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:22,880
part of it on the ocean some parts in

519
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,919
that detention in australia and some in

520
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:27,440
manus

521
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:30,480
and mostly they put in their pockets

522
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,320
i mean the companies so in manus island

523
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,280
there were some companies who were

524
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:36,480
working there

525
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:39,280
like g4s

526
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,080
they were working for six months after

527
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,360
that

528
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,080
transfer and then they changed their

529
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:48,240
names to

530
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,559
broad spectrum and ihms

531
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,919
uh paladin you know these companies who

532
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:55,360
were working there

533
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:59,760
and their contract they

534
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:03,760
was you know hundreds million dollars

535
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:07,280
they um they made the hundred

536
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:10,400
million dollars in that island but

537
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:14,080
uh the local people were

538
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:18,080
forgotten you know for example

539
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:21,439
the hospital there so the local people

540
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:23,760
were dying very easily

541
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,559
in a very simple way because there was

542
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,600
not

543
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:31,918
proper medical treatment for them

544
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,918
and beside that

545
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:39,280
hospital they were making a huge

546
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:42,399
amount of money and they could

547
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:47,120
spend only uh

548
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:51,039
one million dollar to fix that hospital

549
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,158
but they didn't do that so that was uh

550
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:57,679
really unacceptable

551
00:22:54,159 --> 00:23:00,799
and in other side uh

552
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:04,320
this policy uh you know

553
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:08,480
so from this 43 000 population

554
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:09,520
at least 2 000 people were working in

555
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,960
the camp

556
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:16,158
directly so as a chef as

557
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:20,480
like a case manager or

558
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:21,200
security guard and at least 20 000

559
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,760
people

560
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
were relied on

561
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:35,439
this on the security companies

562
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:37,520
twenty thousand people indirectly

563
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,120
so they actually what's happening in

564
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:42,480
manus island

565
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:46,080
so when they exile us to manus island

566
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:49,919
the economy in that country that island

567
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,600
was on base of agriculture

568
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,640
traditional agriculture and on hunting

569
00:23:53,600 --> 00:24:01,360
mostly and they had their

570
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:04,960
traditional economy so what's happened

571
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:09,279
for six everyone were

572
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:13,120
involved in these companies and they

573
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:16,559
so actually they changed the

574
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,120
lifestyle in that island and after six

575
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:21,678
years

576
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:27,120
suddenly they closed manus prison camp

577
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:27,120
and that economy collapsed

578
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,279
and everyone became jobless and they

579
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,678
didn't

580
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:40,000
replace it to a new

581
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:44,200
economy so it was not a stable economy

582
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,570
and that's why if we now we look at that

583
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,960
island

584
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:49,200
[Music]

585
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:50,240
sorry that i talked a lot i finished it

586
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:53,440
now

587
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:58,159
that in that island now

588
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,640
people became jobless domestic violence

589
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:01,360
which is a serious problem in papua new

590
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,200
guinea

591
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,639
it's very serious problem now is

592
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:12,840
increasing uh there is a

593
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:16,080
like a cultural like

594
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:20,000
people you know

595
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:24,000
alcoholism or drinking

596
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:27,039
alcohol is getting worse

597
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:31,760
and also using drug and in

598
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:34,879
other side 40 children remain

599
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:37,919
so these 40 children women they are they

600
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:40,320
where are their fathers their fathers

601
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,159
are refugees

602
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:49,039
who were transferred to

603
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,919
america some of them were transferred to

604
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:54,158
australia and now they are in detention

605
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,520
and some of them remain in port mosby

606
00:25:54,159 --> 00:26:00,960
the capital city and what's happened

607
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:04,400
there is not a law or any process to

608
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:07,760
that these people take their children

609
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,440
with themselves and their wives

610
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:12,879
so that created so much problem in that

611
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:16,799
island

612
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:20,400
because of the culture there

613
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:23,520
that the culture there people

614
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:26,720
the identity is on base of

615
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:29,679
land and these children

616
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,520
they know they won't have any land in

617
00:26:29,679 --> 00:26:34,400
that island and they will have

618
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,158
so much problem and right now that

619
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:42,080
created really and in other side

620
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:45,440
this policy damaged the environment

621
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,639
very very seriously they damaged the

622
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:52,240
environment just imagine for

623
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,159
six years we didn't have

624
00:26:52,240 --> 00:27:00,960
uh so we always in that prison camp

625
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:04,080
we had to they had to use plastic

626
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:09,600
you know so we didn't have a metal

627
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,600
spoon or plate everything was

628
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:18,240
plastic and

629
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:21,918
each person each person

630
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:26,960
produce like one kilo plastic at least

631
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:29,600
per day so we were 1000 people

632
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,880
and at least 2 000 people were working

633
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:35,678
there

634
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:39,279
so 3 000 people per meal

635
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,440
you know so what is that that plastic

636
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:43,679
you know i know that they had they had

637
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,399
the contract with the company there

638
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:46,399
who put the

639
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:53,760
plastic i think

640
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:56,399
in a place close to the ocean so that

641
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:57,840
really really that damaged the island

642
00:27:56,399 --> 00:28:02,639
and also they

643
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:06,000
cut the jungle to build new prisons

644
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,080
and later after six years i

645
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,080
saw that really they

646
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:18,639
changed they cut

647
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:21,678
trees a lot because they are going

648
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:26,159
to i mean the

649
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:27,520
american navy is planning to go to that

650
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,720
island

651
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:35,039
so i mean in the history of

652
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:39,840
that island or in the history of

653
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:44,559
pacific countries

654
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,559
australia and superpowers they always

655
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:49,279
look at those countries act like

656
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:50,158
a backyard you know they look at

657
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,399
manuscripts

658
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:53,520
as a place that they put their rubbish

659
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,760
there

660
00:28:53,520 --> 00:29:01,440
you know they produce violence there

661
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:04,879
they export violence there you know

662
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,159
so it is uh i think uh

663
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:10,840
it's very important that now

664
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,000
we look at this policy in different

665
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:17,199
aspects not only about refugees

666
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:19,679
this policy

667
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,679
doesn't

668
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:27,840
impact on refugees only

669
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:31,279
that impact on local people

670
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:35,279
that impact on the region

671
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:41,360
and impact negatively on australia

672
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:45,520
damage the democracy and the principles

673
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,799
in that country but unfortunately

674
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,679
uh people or

675
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,799
the you know academics or experts you

676
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:56,240

677
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,000
in and the media they really they are

678
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,000
not aware of it

679
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:04,080

00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:30,240
australian citizen

688
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,760
a right-wing person terrorist

689
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,880
and i believe what's happened in

690
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:38,399
christchurch

691
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:41,520
has roots in manus island

692
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:43,840
in naru island has roots

693
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,600
in what the australian government has

694
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:49,439
done in those islands

695
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:54,080
because they did that on base of

696
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:57,600
a long term of hate speech

697
00:30:54,080 --> 00:31:01,279
and that hate speech when you do that

698
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:03,519
it will you cannot control it

699
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:05,360
and someone came here and did that

700
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:09,519
terrible horrible thing

701
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,360
yeah thank you

702
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,519
that was really illuminating and so

703
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,959
important to be talking about and i'm

704
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,120
hoping that you're going to be writing

705
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,039
more about this um now that you're in

706
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:21,039
new zealand you'll be writing more

707
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:22,158
one thing i want to really get back to

708
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,799
is also

709
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:26,000
the use of these private security firms

710
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:29,039
on the islands

711
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:30,880
and as we're in a tech conference and

712
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,559
a lot of the audience here will be

713
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,200
coming from different tech companies or

714
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:36,960
tech

715
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,960
adjacent work and and we've seen

716
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,200
especially in the us some of these

717
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,120
companies that may be even present

718
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,960
at rightscon i know some of them are

719
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,600
present where we have the microsoft's we

720
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:47,519
have

721
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,799
amazon we have dell and so on who have

722
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:52,320
been implicated

723
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,960
in contracting business from um

724
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:57,360
these security companies such as g4s

725
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,159
circle and so on

726
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,719
and they also companies that really want

727
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:02,799
to

728
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,080
um present themselves and a lot of their

729
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,519
work as

730
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,840
being for the people and for the

731
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,720
betterment of humanity and

732
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,199
there's been a lot of different work

733
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:14,799
from

734
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:16,480
um company employees uh when it came out

735
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:17,679
that there were different contracts with

736
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,600
ice in the u.s

737
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:21,919
for example and the immigration

738
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:24,480
enforcement in the u.s

739
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,120
and but we are pretty sure that some

740
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,039
similar

741
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,120
um contracts between tech companies

742
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:31,360
whether it's cloud services and so on

743
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,000
are happening with these tech companies

744
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:35,120
and what i want to ask you to maybe have

745
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,919
a short message about

746
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,559
is to folks that could potentially

747
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,399
either

748
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:42,320
bring up these issues within their own

749
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,879
companies or within this community

750
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,439
that is a powerful tech community to

751
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,480
hold

752
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:51,760
companies that potentially make millions

753
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:54,880
from these private and enforcement uh

754
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:56,480
companies to and kind of

755
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,880
raise their voices and what would you

756
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,240
want them to really bring up and how do

757
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,640
you want them to hold

758
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,000
their contracts with private immigration

759
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:06,480
enforcement companies

760
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,480
to account

761
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:14,000
yeah i think uh you know uh just a quick

762
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:16,399
uh thing i should mention is that you

763
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,840
know we have a long

764
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:23,199
uh history or you know for

765
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:26,158
such a long time the civil

766
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:27,519
society in australia a part of civil

767
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,720
society

768
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:34,559
they have been protesting they have been

769
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,600
criticizing uh this

770
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,120
government to release the refugees but

771
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,719
still this policy exists

772
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,518
and still this industry i mean refugee

773
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:49,440
industry

774
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:53,760
exists so

775
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:56,880
why i think the main reason

776
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,200
is that we should have this question who

777
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:01,360
is

778
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:02,240
behind this policy i think the heart of

779
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:05,439
this

780
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:10,639
policy is the are the

781
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:13,918
companies and if we don't criticize them

782
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:15,119
if we don't put pressure on them nothing

783
00:34:13,918 --> 00:34:17,918
change

784
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:19,040
so instead of only criticizing the

785
00:34:17,918 --> 00:34:22,078
government

786
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:24,560
we should criticize these companies too

787
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,919
because no one talk about them you know

788
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:31,199
a company such as

789
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:31,199
ihms international health

790
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:39,759
medical service so

791
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:43,679
they i think they are the most

792
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:47,200
uh the most

793
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:50,879
you know brutal part of this system

794
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:53,918
and they hide themselves because

795
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,960
behind the morality

796
00:34:53,918 --> 00:35:00,640
because they say that we are providing

797
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:02,240
medical treatment for the refugees but

798
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:05,920
in fact

799
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,040
they are worse than g4s

800
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,760
because geforce we know g4s geforce is a

801
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:13,119
company

802
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:18,320
or circle or other companies they

803
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:21,520
said that we are security company

804
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:25,359
but ihms is a company

805
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,960
that we they claim something else

806
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,359
but they are very i think the main

807
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:33,119
part of this systematic torture i have

808
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:36,960
say that

809
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:40,560
and i will say that you know

810
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:45,040
so what we will should do on them

811
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:48,480
i think uh i don't know how to put

812
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:52,320
pressure on them but i think

813
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:55,440
they are the heart of this policy

814
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:59,280
and we should put pressure on them

815
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:04,079
and we should cancel they put the

816
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,960
pressure on some the companies

817
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:07,359
who are doing advertising for them or

818
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:11,119
who

819
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,000
are supporting them to cancel their

820
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:17,200
contract

821
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,599
and we did that once in australia

822
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,680
and the interesting thing is that some

823
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,079
of these companies

824
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:29,118
they have contract with the universities

825
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:32,800
you know the universities

826
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:36,640
so in fact the universities are

827
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:40,320
they are keeping people in those islands

828
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:43,359
on with the money that is

829
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:47,200
provided by the universities and

830
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:50,240
the universities invite someone like me

831
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,439
to go there and talk about this

832
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:56,319
you know i don't want to

833
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,920
mention a particular name here but in

834
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,680
australia that happened

835
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,680
for example ngv

836
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,399
and sometimes these universities or the

837
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,799
galleries they are not aware of this we

838
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,480
should

839
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,400
help them we should provide information

840
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:16,000
for them that they understand it for

841
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,200
example

842
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,119
ngv which is a gallery

843
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:25,200
national gallery of victoria for example

844
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:26,400
you know they had contact with one of

845
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:31,279
the these

846
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:35,040
companies and the art community

847
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,200
had a protest and

848
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:39,680
it's very interesting i was in that

849
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,680
gallery

850
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,240
and i was talking about uh you know

851
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,880
artworks about this

852
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:54,720
flight so i mean it's very paradoxical

853
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,880
and we should be aware that sometimes

854
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:01,919
even those people who are really

855
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,200
care about these issues and they are a

856
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,640
part of this system

857
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,640
and they are not aware of that

858
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:14,400
even yeah i want to talk about myself

859
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:18,000
that even i myself sometimes

860
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:21,040
i see that you know look

861
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:23,839
uh how this system try to

862
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,200
take control of someone like me or omi

863
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:28,560
or people who are

864
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:32,480
working you know i mean that we are

865
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,839
facing a very complex system

866
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,800
and we should be really careful uh

867
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,359
but i don't know how to do that but i

868
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:43,359
think they

869
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:43,359
are the companies are the heart

870
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,359
of this policy and we should criticize

871
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:51,440
them

872
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:55,119
yes especially ihms

873
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:58,640
ihms is the most

874
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:01,040
uh brutal part of this system

875
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,598
thank you thank you for that and i think

876
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:05,359
part of this course especially for the

877
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,800
conference we're talking at in the

878
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:10,720
community we're talking to

879
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,240
is that people that um

880
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,000
protested and striked against the

881
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,279
implication of their company that

882
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,680
they're working out

883
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:21,599
within these sort of um private

884
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,560
companies and enforcement agencies

885
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,880
should also

886
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,839
hopefully look into whether their

887
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,359
companies are

888
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:29,040
also implicated in things that are

889
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:31,759
happening all over the world

890
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,759
including in manus and in australia and

891
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,760
continue to put pressure on it it's a

892
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,800
difficult and complex system as you are

893
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,800
explaining

894
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,640
but there are certain things and certain

895
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:42,000
ways we can hold some of these companies

896
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,520
who become implicated

897
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,520
accountable and i think that's really

898
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:47,440
fundamental and i'm

899
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:48,560
quite um happy to see that there's more

900
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,960
research being done

901
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,599
into some of the private contracts

902
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:53,599
happening

903
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:55,200
with some of these companies and on

904
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,440
these islands

905
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,118
and the thing i really want to get to as

906
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,119
well and i know a lot of um

907
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:03,280
folks in this community want to talk

908
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,160
about is we all know

909
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:07,280
the the way you and your collaborators

910
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,040
had to bypass

911
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,800
and surveillance and information

912
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,720
controls on the island

913
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,000
and omid could you give a little bit of

914
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,118
an outline

915
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,800
on how they tried to block information

916
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:20,480
from coming out from the islands and the

917
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,520
different methods they used

918
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,319
and also a little bit about the ways you

919
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:28,319
and other folks that were there managed

920
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:31,359
to get this information out and

921
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:33,279
frankly make the government look um

922
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,119
terrible in its actions and hold them

923
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,119
accountable bit by bit

924
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:44,319
yeah um really important um point um but

925
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,799
also really difficult to uh to cover to

926
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,040
explain comprehensively i'll do my best

927
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:52,079
and i'll also add something about some

928
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:54,880
of the maybe philosophical implications

929
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:57,119
of um doing this kind of work and

930
00:40:54,880 --> 00:41:00,160
designing these kinds of strategies

931
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,400
so essentially um

932
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,480
beterus created a whole network of

933
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,680
people around him

934
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,400
initially through um through smuggled

935
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,720
phones

936
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,720
um he had very limited internet access

937
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:15,919
in the in the prison in the beginning

938
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:16,560
so he he tried his best uh using those

939
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:20,240
methods

940
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:21,680
but then he smuggled in a mobile phone

941
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,000
um into the prison there was an

942
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:26,078
underground economy there especially

943
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,079
uh with the um with the local people

944
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,280
working in the in the detention center

945
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,839
um providing help and embarrassed

946
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:35,599
managed to get a phone and he contacted

947
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:36,799
a whole range of people and created a

948
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:39,760
whole network

949
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:42,319
a support base around him and yeah

950
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:45,359
through that he was introduced to

951
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:48,400
his first translator munis mansubi who

952
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:50,960
translated for him and his articles uh

953
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:53,920
began to be published and he started to

954
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,040
um interact with a lot of journalists

955
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,960
and

956
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,480
one of those articles uh that was

957
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,280
published in the guardian and i think it

958
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:02,319
was his first

959
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,400
article under his real name uh that in

960
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,720
the first article in the guardian i read

961
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:06,480
that

962
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,078
and um and i contacted him through

963
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:11,119
facebook and with

964
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:12,400
horrible internet access and with um a

965
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:15,440
situation where he

966
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:17,839
couldn't answer all of these messages

967
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,040
luckily my message got through and he

968
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:23,359
responded and

969
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,359
we soon moved to whatsapp and basically

970
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:27,520
like he had been doing with munis he

971
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:29,759
started sending me messages

972
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:31,359
sending me articles to translate through

973
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,119
whatsapp

974
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,359
and he he made a movie through whatsapp

975
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:38,400
and that movie was co-directed with

976
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:40,880
someone an

977
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,560
iranian dutch filmmaker living in the

978
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:44,400
netherlands

979
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:46,000
so a whole range of really amazing

980
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,040
things happened as a result

981
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:50,400
of a smuggled phone and a weak

982
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,200
connection

983
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,760
and a lot of perseverance and creativity

984
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,720
so

985
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:57,280
uh bedrooms basically um wrote his whole

986
00:42:56,720 --> 00:42:59,919
book

987
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,520
uh on whatsapp and though the messages

988
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:04,480
were sent to muniz who

989
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:06,960
uh compiled them um with petrus's

990
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:09,520
instructions into pdf files

991
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:11,440
they were sent to me uh i was

992
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:13,440
translating and bechus was at the same

993
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,160
time sending even more messages to add

994
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,880
into

995
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,879
uh the pdfs that i had so like i said

996
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:21,680
it's very confusing very complex

997
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,000
but all of this was taking place and he

998
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,480
was getting more and more attention

999
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:29,760
around the world especially after the

1000
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:31,920
the 23 day siege in 2017

1001
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:33,920
uh at that time his profile around the

1002
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,200
world increased dramatically

1003
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:38,960
and a lot of people were taking uh um

1004
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:40,240
giving a lot of attention to the work

1005
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:42,640
that he was doing

1006
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,598
and it was um it was soon after that

1007
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,920
that

1008
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,640
essentially he started to be recognized

1009
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,200
seriously by academics and started to be

1010
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,040
uh his his ideas and his resistance

1011
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:57,040
started to become central to a lot of

1012
00:43:55,040 --> 00:44:00,640
different campaigns and movements

1013
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,000
now uh there was a whole different range

1014
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,359
of ways that we were

1015
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,319
bypassing the um the censorship there

1016
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:09,440
but i should mention that it was in 2016

1017
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:12,000
after the uh

1018
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:14,160
supreme court ruling in papua new guinea

1019
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:16,560
that um stated that the detention center

1020
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,680
is illegal and unconstitutional

1021
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,480
it was after that that the

1022
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:24,078
the immigration department the the

1023
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,040
system basically couldn't stop

1024
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,720
people having phones uh in the prison so

1025
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:30,079
from that point on betos didn't have to

1026
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:32,480
hide his phone anymore

1027
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:33,520
but he began to be subject to a whole

1028
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,560
range of different

1029
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:38,160
kinds of um silencing strategies

1030
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,440
different kinds of oppression different

1031
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:42,560
kinds of suppression

1032
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,920
so which included bullying tactics

1033
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:47,920
and and and other other ways

1034
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:50,560
forced movement forced displacement

1035
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:52,480
within the within the island so

1036
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,759
so it's uh there were a whole range of

1037
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:56,800
different obstacles that were

1038
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,119
placed um in front of him but we we

1039
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,200
managed to do it and i think the book is

1040
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,240
just a testament to the human

1041
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,799
um to the human will to the

1042
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:08,879
to resistance to the desire to have

1043
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:11,119
freedom to to be heard

1044
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:12,960
um the last point i want to make is

1045
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:15,440
about the the philosophical

1046
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,000
dimension to this now a lot of people

1047
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,000
ask

1048
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,119
uh why didn't the australian government

1049
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,839
just step in

1050
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:23,920
and um take his phone and and stop him

1051
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:27,119
from doing everything stop him from

1052
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:30,000
exposing this system and in a very

1053
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,000
perverse way

1054
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,280
bethesda's reporting because activism

1055
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,640
bethesda's writing

1056
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,240
became almost like

1057
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:45,759
a promotional tool for the oppressive

1058
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:48,160
um border politics in australia

1059
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:50,000
for a system that is designed to deter

1060
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:52,879
people from coming there

1061
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:54,160
to that country and uh seeking asylum

1062
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,359
for a system that is

1063
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:57,359
actually um

1064
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,960
whose sole purpose is to make things so

1065
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:06,079
horrible that people

1066
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:09,520
will agree to to be deported

1067
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,560
or never attempt to

1068
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,359
ask for um protection again in a system

1069
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:17,520
like that

1070
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:21,598
bethesda's work actually supports the

1071
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:23,040
the rhetoric of the government now

1072
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,720
i think one of the reasons why they

1073
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,640
didn't censor him completely was

1074
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:28,000
one because they wanted they wanted

1075
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:30,400
people around the world to know

1076
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,119
how brutal they are how how difficult it

1077
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,920
is to

1078
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,520
um or impossible it is to go to

1079
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,280
australia and seek asylum

1080
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:38,800
but at the same time they realize that

1081
00:46:37,280 --> 00:46:42,800
if they stop their rules

1082
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:46,160
they actually confirm uh his critique

1083
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,720
about them being fascist about them uh

1084
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:49,759
applying fascist techniques to uh to

1085
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:52,240
suppress people

1086
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,079
so i think this dimension is really

1087
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:56,160
important as well but

1088
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:58,400
after everything that petrus had done

1089
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,480
after all the resistance after

1090
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:01,520
um finding ways to get the message

1091
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:03,520
across

1092
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:05,359
i think what's important is that

1093
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,319
veterans created a crack

1094
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:09,598
in the system and that crack um was

1095
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:10,480
something that the system couldn't

1096
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:13,920
anticipate

1097
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:16,880
and had no strategy or no no reaction to

1098
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,920
and you know winning the awards um uh

1099
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:20,800
being able to flee

1100
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:22,319
from the island and go to new zealand um

1101
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:25,680
becoming a spokesperson

1102
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,319
for human rights for uh for uh

1103
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:30,078
freedom of movement for for justice for

1104
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:31,520
people whose lives have been ruined

1105
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:33,200
that was something that the system

1106
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:35,680
didn't anticipate who

1107
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,799
didn't have a response to doesn't know

1108
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:40,399
how to react

1109
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:40,720
to and in fact the last point is that

1110
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:43,119
the

1111
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,160
politicians in australia refused

1112
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,720
publicly

1113
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:47,279
to talk about behaviors in any serious

1114
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,919
way

1115
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:52,559
most of them never mention his name

1116
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:54,480
because they know once they do that

1117
00:47:52,559 --> 00:47:55,839
every once will begin to see him as a

1118
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:59,599
human being

1119
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:02,319
as um someone who deserves

1120
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:03,520
uh rights deserves freedom just like

1121
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:06,240
everyone else

1122
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,880
someone who is creative intelligent

1123
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:09,040
someone

1124
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:10,640
who knows something about our society

1125
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:13,759
and our politics that

1126
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:17,359
maybe we don't and to

1127
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,680
to identify him in any way to um

1128
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:22,720
uh to um discuss to talk about him as a

1129
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,319
person

1130
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,919
will go against everything that the

1131
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,279
government has been designing

1132
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:32,800
um in terms of dehumanizing refugees so

1133
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:35,599
because activism ultimately in the end

1134
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:37,599
uh damaged the government in a way that

1135
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,200
they don't know how to respond to

1136
00:48:37,599 --> 00:48:40,960
and i think this should be used or

1137
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:43,759
leveraged to basically

1138
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,559
um create new ways forward to dismantle

1139
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:47,200
the system

1140
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
and to ensure uh the rights of all

1141
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:50,960
people um

1142
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,520
subject to border politics thank you

1143
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:55,040
that is

1144
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:56,960
incredibly fascinating and the

1145
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,960
different dimensions of it and the

1146
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,800
different ways the australian government

1147
00:48:58,960 --> 00:49:03,359
is trying to navigate

1148
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,480
and and save their own image is really

1149
00:49:03,359 --> 00:49:07,040
fascinating too

1150
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,599
and i i did want to ask a question i

1151
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,599
think we

1152
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:11,680
had this question when we had our chat

1153
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:14,079
too for

1154
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,839
so much so much of the information that

1155
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,359
was

1156
00:49:14,839 --> 00:49:18,240
being censored and being blocked from

1157
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:21,040
coming out

1158
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:22,078
and you managed to get it out eventually

1159
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:24,160
and

1160
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,760
there was the different tools that you

1161
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:27,520
use the different tech tools that you

1162
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:29,280
used and we are in a community

1163
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:31,520
where there are a lot of technologists

1164
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,680
there are different activists

1165
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:35,440
someone who are working within the tech

1166
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:37,759
center who may be listening or will

1167
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:41,200
listen to this afterwards

1168
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,000
what would you say is needed

1169
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:46,480
from these um either technologists or

1170
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:49,599
and tech companies like twitter

1171
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:52,240
and facebook whatsapp so on

1172
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:54,000
is needed in terms of and then providing

1173
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,919
more support for those who are in

1174
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,280
similar situations right now to get

1175
00:49:55,920 --> 00:49:59,920
these stories out

1176
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,680
and we don't have enough time to get

1177
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,359
into this very deeply but

1178
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:05,359
if you have some quick reflections

1179
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,800
did i answer yes i think uh you know the

1180
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,680
first part of

1181
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:20,559
what omits said actually i'm not angry

1182
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:23,598
that he said that in some ways

1183
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:27,040
they were quite happy

1184
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,280
that we could send a message or you know

1185
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,319
no that is a political thing that

1186
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:32,400
australian

1187
00:50:30,319 --> 00:50:34,720
government political comment they say

1188
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:38,000
that so

1189
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:41,118
we want to send a message to

1190
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:43,200
refugees in other countries that don't

1191
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,680
come to here if you come here we do

1192
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,720
this on you you know we are horrible

1193
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:49,680
people

1194
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,720
i am not angry with that why because

1195
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,839
they exile

1196
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:55,839
us to a remote place

1197
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,119
that because they didn't want that

1198
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,160
people

1199
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:05,359
hear about us they exiled us there

1200
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:09,279
they wanted to torture us there

1201
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:09,920
and send us back and they didn't have a

1202
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,440
plan

1203
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,079
at the beginning you know after a while

1204
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,119
they kept

1205
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:18,319
us there they they create another

1206
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,720
strategy so

1207
00:51:18,319 --> 00:51:22,160
always they change they never had the

1208
00:51:20,720 --> 00:51:25,759
strategy about this

1209
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,960
i believe in that the the thing is that

1210
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,000
they

1211
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:33,040
to us so we didn't have access to

1212
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,070
internet they always search our

1213
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:37,200
rooms our tents to take our

1214
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:40,480
[Music]

1215
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:43,919
phones and they took my phone

1216
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:47,839
twice and i had to struggle

1217
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:51,040
to smuggle another phone in

1218
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,359
you know and they did all of these and

1219
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,359
why

1220
00:51:53,920 --> 00:52:01,760
why they didn't stop me they

1221
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:05,119
did that they

1222
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:08,240
tried that and they took my phone twice

1223
00:52:05,119 --> 00:52:12,480
but i think the good thing that i did

1224
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:15,439
i'm happy about it is that for two years

1225
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:16,480
i didn't publish work under my real name

1226
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:20,400
because i didn't feel

1227
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,359
safe with them after two years when i

1228
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:24,559
became sure

1229
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:28,480
that i have a network

1230
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:33,839
i have a network of journalists

1231
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:36,640
you know human rights defenders you know

1232
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:37,680
on that time i probably started to

1233
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:40,799
publish my work

1234
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:44,839
so i didn't definitely

1235
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:46,800
if they knew and the interesting thing

1236
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:49,920
they there was a

1237
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:51,520
document that linked to the media after

1238
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,800
six years

1239
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,839
that we did a story on guardian

1240
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:03,599
so with guardian and they

1241
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:03,599
uh employed uh that the detective

1242
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:06,960
and send it to the prison camp to find

1243
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:11,200
out

1244
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:14,480
who is providing this information

1245
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:17,680
it was important for them and

1246
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,400
so i mean that it was not easy yeah we

1247
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:21,040
were

1248
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,359
always i say that that there is this the

1249
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:25,279
way australian government is treating

1250
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:29,598
the refugees

1251
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:33,040
is a dictatorship

1252
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:36,240
and even they

1253
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:40,240
had this law that anyone who talk

1254
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:42,879
anyone from the staff they have this law

1255
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,720
in australia they put them in jail for

1256
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,079
two years

1257
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:50,879
and they deported many uh

1258
00:53:48,079 --> 00:53:53,760
journalists from manus island sometimes

1259
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,640
some journalists reached to that island

1260
00:53:53,760 --> 00:54:00,640
and i remember they put the picture of

1261
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:04,720
ben doherty from guardian in the office

1262
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:08,160
and in on the island

1263
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:10,959
that anyone who see this man let us know

1264
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:12,640
call this number so i mean that there

1265
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:16,319
was a very

1266
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:19,200
very dictatorship system there

1267
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,319
and even they deported omit do you

1268
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,520
remember

1269
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:27,759
you know they oh they deported omid once

1270
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:31,040
he yeah he uh actually

1271
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,440
reached the island one day uh i think

1272
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:34,480
after

1273
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:36,079
five years yeah they deported him oh i

1274
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:38,319
didn't know that

1275
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,920
yeah yeah it was not i mean that it was

1276
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:43,359
not easy

1277
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:46,480
and so regarding the companies such as

1278
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:50,558
twitter actually twitter for me

1279
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:53,680
uh i hate twitter because

1280
00:54:50,559 --> 00:54:56,160
no no because i am

1281
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:57,680
i'm i know myself as an artist and

1282
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:00,720
twitter doesn't let me

1283
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:04,640
to have my own space that's why i hate

1284
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:08,240
twitter i use it but i love twitter too

1285
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:11,680
because the twitter is for me

1286
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:15,200
uh is like uh my

1287
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:21,118
media so i really

1288
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:24,399
use twitter a lot and twitter really

1289
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:28,799
was a has been a great platform

1290
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:31,280
for me to say what i want to say

1291
00:55:28,799 --> 00:55:32,319
and challenge the system to share my

1292
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:36,799
works

1293
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:41,040
and facebook too and whatsapp

1294
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:45,359
i love whatsapp because whatsapp is like

1295
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:48,240
my office i made the movie there

1296
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,680
i wrote a book there and i published i

1297
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:53,200
wrote

1298
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,480
many articles there and i

1299
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:59,919
communicated to the world with the word

1300
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:03,119
through whatsapp and i think

1301
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:06,319
yeah so i mean generally what what i

1302
00:56:03,119 --> 00:56:08,799
want from these companies

1303
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:10,400
uh that i have a paradoxical feeling

1304
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:13,359
towards them

1305
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:14,240
especially twitter i hate it and i love

1306
00:56:13,359 --> 00:56:19,200
it

1307
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:22,479
which is security it's very important

1308
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:26,160
security because i really didn't feel

1309
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:29,440
safe when i was there and now

1310
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,000
with the so i'm not expert in this issue

1311
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:33,839
but it

1312
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:38,319
is my only concern really i was so

1313
00:56:33,839 --> 00:56:38,319
concerned about my security

1314
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,240
yeah this is a really important point

1315
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:45,839
and i think it speaks to a lot of people

1316
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,879
that may be watching and we are running

1317
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:48,960
out of time

1318
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:51,359
i'm sorry for anyone that may have had

1319
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:54,960
questions but i think some of the

1320
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:57,200
um massive points that we have and calls

1321
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:59,599
to actions that we have from both of you

1322
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,680
is that when we need to hold a lot of

1323
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:03,920
these companies and these private

1324
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,720
contracts accountable we need to figure

1325
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:07,200
out who

1326
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:08,399
is continuing to sponsor them even

1327
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,399
within our own

1328
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:11,760
and tech and human rights communities

1329
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:13,359
that and we

1330
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:14,960
are aware of that these contracts

1331
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:18,240
continue to happen

1332
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:19,040
to provide more of a voice to people who

1333
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,200
are

1334
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:23,440
in similar situations and continue to

1335
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:25,598
understand the impact beyond

1336
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,880
um the camps themselves but their

1337
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:29,440
colonial impact

1338
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:29,920
on the indigenous communities on these

1339
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,240
different

1340
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,960
um islands in different places and

1341
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,439
finally

1342
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:37,040
we need more security and i and i know

1343
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:40,319
this is not a

1344
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:43,599
area for you and me but the people that

1345
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:45,440
who are listening are many of

1346
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:46,960
the experts that would be working on

1347
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:50,480
some of this stuff and

1348
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:51,119
but i want to thank you both incredibly

1349
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:53,200
thank you

1350
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:55,760
i'm really sorry i should mention just

1351
00:57:53,200 --> 00:58:00,240
one sentence

1352
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:03,520
it's uh which is about the truth so

1353
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:06,558
online violence actually i have been

1354
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:09,599
under attack by the trolls

1355
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:14,960
for many years

1356
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,960
and still i am facing this

1357
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:22,559
yes i i never block them

1358
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:25,680
but it's really difficult sometimes they

1359
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:29,119
yeah they are really and i mostly

1360
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:32,480
i'm really worried about

1361
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:37,119
people who follow me for example

1362
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:39,839
because they they find it very brutal

1363
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,480
and many of them always say that oh we

1364
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:44,000
cannot

1365
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:46,000
continue like but i mostly i you know my

1366
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:48,799

1367
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:52,400
don't care about them but really

1368
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:55,440
uh yeah it's it is a big problem

1369
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,480

1370
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:59,680
