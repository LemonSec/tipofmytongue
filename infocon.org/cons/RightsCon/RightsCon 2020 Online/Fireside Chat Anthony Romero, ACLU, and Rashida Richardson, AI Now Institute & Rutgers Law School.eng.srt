you know crazy new um civil and

22
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,560
political crisis that

23
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,960
is facing the us and i just want to pay

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,200
my

25
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,798
respect to both of you and also some

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,960
sympathies as well for just having to

27
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,520
deal with

28
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,600
everything that's going on in the us but

29
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,600
today's announcement

30
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,798
kicking right off the bat from the

31
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,160
president is

32
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,440
um relates to the the date of the u.s

33
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,120
election

34
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,200
um and i think it's something that we've

35
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,879
been waiting for in a way and probably

36
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,480
you guys have been waiting for it

37
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,079
or um you know the possibility of the

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
president actually announcing that an

39
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,000
election should be

40
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,359
delayed um there's obviously legal many

41
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,800
legal constraints preventing that from

42
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,160
happening happening but anthony do you

43
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,200
want to just kick off and let us know

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,920
like

45
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,319
what that tweet says what it means and

46
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,958
how the aclu would respond to such a

47
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,200
suggestion he doesn't have the power i

48
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,480
mean it's just he's just

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,200
rattling everyone's cage whether you're

50
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,799
sitting in an apartment in brooklyn

51
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,720
or in australia or overseas or

52
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,680
it's just this is a president that's

53
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,200
just uh taking it as his mission to

54
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,920
torment broad swaths of the american

55
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
public

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,200
and i think we have to take some of what

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,359
he does

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,119
very seriously i think another bunch of

59
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,319
it we just have to kind of write it off

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,840
to the

61
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,159
man who's in the oval office as

62
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
becoming unhinged and using these new

63
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,840
technologies as a way to make us all

64
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,280
unhinged there's no way he can push back

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,080
the date of the election there he's been

66
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,239
on on twitter today all about kind of

67
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,480
vote by mail and the fraud

68
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,400
and you know what i would say to brett

69
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,879
and to my friends and colleagues is like

70
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:34,400
we all have to take a deep breath

71
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,518
and take what he says with an enormous

72
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,360
grain of salt

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,159
and just keep our heads down and focus

74
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,560
and not and not rise to the bait of it

75
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:46,798
all

76
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,799
um but you know the the thing about the

77
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,319
about the u.s election or about any

78
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,959
election really and we've talked about

79
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,679
elections

80
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,920
all week at wright's con how governments

81
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,040
are trying to

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,439
to interfere you know we've seen

83
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,159
internet shutdowns happening uh

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,799
all over the world often connected to an

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,879
into

86
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,040
to an election in the lead-ups to an

87
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:08,720
election during an election or even

88
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,040
post an election when you know

89
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,840
governments or leaders don't want the

90
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,679
actual results to be

91
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,238
communicated um and so you know

92
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,799
ultimately this is perhaps like the most

93
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,399
important

94
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,479
civil and political right that we have

95
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:26,638
which is to be able to determine

96
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,560
uh our leader um so do you think that

97
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,720
do you think that trump in doing this i

98
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,919
mean obviously we've seen the the u.s

99
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:34,880
economy

100
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,159
tank there's been a 10 reduction in gdp

101
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,360
just announced i think

102
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,680
today as well today do you think he kind

103
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,680
of

104
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,440
i mean i know you you've probably spent

105
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,600
the last you know close on four years

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,080
trying to understand the mind

107
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,520
um of the president but do you think he

108
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:52,400
understands that like

109
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,359
that the election is actually a

110
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,520
fundamental

111
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,360
[Music]

112
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,120
defining um moment and

113
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,800
and and kind of infrastructure of

114
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,199
american democracy or do you think he

115
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,440
just

116
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
doesn't even know or care

117
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,880
oh i think he definitely cares i mean i

118
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,080
think part of what you're seeing

119
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:15,520
is and we ought not underestimate

120
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,880
his attention to the facts

121
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
or to the polls um

122
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,960
i think he clearly apprehends i mean no

123
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,240
one fully knows what goes through his

124
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,120
mind except he

125
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,880
um himself but i think the the

126
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,360
understanding that the poll numbers show

127
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
that he

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,120
is very much under water in most of the

129
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,759
kind of face-to-face polls and even done

130
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
by

131
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:39,360
fox news and other of the outlets and

132
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,239
kind of really important battleground

133
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,680
states

134
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,840
the idea that we're actually talking

135
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,360
about texas

136
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
in states like georgia and elsewhere

137
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,160
being in play

138
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,520
it's kind of uh and every republican's

139
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,800
nightmare

140
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:57,039
and you know the democratic party uh is

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,000
trying to capitalize upon it i i'm not

142
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,400
sure they

143
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
will see how they do um but i know that

144
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,039
that

145
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,199
i think the president's focus on these

146
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:06,719
set of issues is is kind of rooted in an

147
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,520
understanding that

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,440
uh he's got to play he's not going to be

149
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
able to pull many of the independents he

150
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
once thought he could get or that he

151
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,919
once had

152
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,680
so the way to do this is to actually

153
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:20,240
galvanize his base with the

154
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,080
kind of highest amount of turnout and

155
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,319
energy and froth

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,919
and kind of throw them the law and order

157
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,479
card use the race

158
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:31,280
dog whistles that are kind of audible

159
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,560
now to all of us very clearly and loudly

160
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:35,119
and then he's going to try to find a way

161
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,919
to kind of to suppress the vote in some

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,560
key states

163
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,440
and you know i'd be really interested in

164
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,039
in hearing

165
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,800
questions from the audience about how

166
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:44,960
it's played out especially in other

167
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,720
country contexts this is not um i mean

168
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,000
this this playbook that we're seeing in

169
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,360
america is a lot like some of the

170
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
international playbooks we've seen in

171
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,720
other countries and i've been

172
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,080
spending a lot more time with my

173
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,680
counterparts in other countries trying

174
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:57,758
to make sure that we understand

175
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
what's played out in kind of failed or

176
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,280
faulty elections

177
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,080
and what could play out here but i think

178
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,440
it's especially important that we

179
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,198
that we be ready and certainly

180
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,800
in the kind of states where he's

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,080
endeavoring to kind of

182
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,560
shut down the access to vote by mail and

183
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,199
to

184
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,680
limit access to the polling booth both

185
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,560
in terms of geographies and in terms of

186
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,280
uh temporal restrictions on the right to

187
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,560
vote

188
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,000
uh it's going to be critically important

189
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,080
rashida what would you say what would

190
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,919
you add to this yeah

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
i was gonna i was gonna actually am i

192
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,198
too optimistic should i be

193
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:37,039
should i be paying more attention to the

194
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:40,000
tweets than i am or am i just

195
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,000
too in new york to do it

196
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:45,520
no i i think it's all a distraction

197
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
and it's and in some ways can have some

198
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,280
intention behind it because

199
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,799
it keeps you distracted by working to

200
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,919
fight for people's rights it keeps you

201
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:55,120
distracted

202
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,680
um but it it sort of coalesces his base

203
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,840
so

204
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,280
i do think i agree with everything you

205
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,080
just said around

206
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,000
sort of the political tactics but i also

207
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,280
think the way that you can see most of

208
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
this administration is

209
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:09,520
an onslaught of tactics of distraction

210
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:16,319
rasheeda do you can i also um ask you

211
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,520
because the the the tactics of

212
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,400
distraction

213
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,719
um are also you know there are victims

214
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,599
of that as well and there are scapegoats

215
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:25,360
and there are

216
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,878
personalities and identities and a lot

217
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,919
of the identities that we're talking

218
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,520
about is like

219
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,039
the sort of the progressive left has

220
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,679
been demonized

221
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,279
as a means to sort of in the certainly

222
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,120
in the way that the protests

223
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,719
the black lives matter protests have

224
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,519
been portrayed um

225
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,800
but also i think there's as as anthony

226
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,720
hinted to there's

227
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:46,399
there's a there's a there's a race issue

228
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,120
at play there's a dog whistle that's at

229
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,720
play

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:54,320
um and i'd love to hear from you

231
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:55,360
um how you think that's playing out and

232
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
and sort of where

233
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,440
in terms of like the right to protest in

234
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,360
the us and also the right to protest

235
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,080
digitally as well which is a very

236
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,440
important element in this new iteration

237
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,600
of descent um houses

238
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,040
um firstly how would you characterize

239
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,519
how the black live

240
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,880
matter movement um writ large is kind of

241
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:18,000
coping with this

242
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,839
and also um how do you see

243
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,279
the kind of sorry for the big questions

244
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,480
but again how do you sort of see the

245
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,399
historical

246
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,399
uh or the history of the us um um

247
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,760
in terms of racial justice and injustice

248
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,360
issues like how do you see that playing

249
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
out now in this car in the lead up to

250
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,080
the current election

251
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,080
yeah so i think the uprisings that

252
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,440
started

253
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,839
after the murder of george floyd have

254
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
kind of evolved in a concerning way for

255
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:48,000
me um

256
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,079
not so much on like there definitely are

257
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,720
attacks on the first amendment front

258
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
and people's ability to exercise that

259
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,000
right

260
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,800
but i also feel like there is also a

261
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
problem of

262
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,560
abstraction and distraction happening

263
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,480
too and that if you

264
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,000
look at most of the recent media

265
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:06,800
coverage and even the general

266
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,200
narratives around portland and the um

267
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:11,040
protests in many other cities

268
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,200
um you don't even hear black lives

269
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,920
matter racial justice or what people

270
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
are protesting about as much and now the

271
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,399
narrative is more about

272
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:21,760
the sort of abuse power being exerted by

273
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,079
federal authorities

274
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,920
the white wall of moms and other aspects

275
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,839
that i think actually distract and take

276
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,439
a lot of attention away from the very

277
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,120
important and necessary work

278
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,360
that needs to happen around criminal

279
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,399
justice reform and advancing racial

280
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,680
justice

281
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:39,680
and i think it also serves to distract

282
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,279
us from the ways that oppressive

283
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,199
practices and cultures

284
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:45,920
that were the whole cause of this

285
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,240
protest are now being reintroduced in

286
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,160
society under a new veneer and i think

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,600
it was yesterday the chicago police

288
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,279
announced that they're creating a new

289
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,200
crime hotspots unit

290
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,040
and that's coming only months after they

291
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,839
just discontinued their productive

292
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,599
policing program and other

293
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:03,360
problematic practices and while they're

294
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,040
marketing this as something different

295
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,480
the composition and the culture

296
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,319
of what's really a historically

297
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,440
problematic police department

298
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,360
hasn't changed and so that's no longer

299
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,160
the focus and i'm also seeing this

300
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:16,240
happen

301
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,319
um this type of dilution and distraction

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,160
happening in the social media space

303
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,519
this week i think the most the thing

304
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,000
that came to my attention

305
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,880
is this effort of women supporting women

306
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
where people are

307
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,160
uh posting photos and it's mostly white

308
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,079
women um

309
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,160
uh black and white photos of themselves

310
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,599
under the guise of empowerment but then

311
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,600
recent reporting

312
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
uh demonstrated that this is actually

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,600
diluting a social media campaign to

314
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:42,959
bring more visibility to femicide

315
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,920
in turkey so i think we need to be very

316
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:48,000
clear about what the issues are and make

317
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:50,479
sure that we're not allowing ourselves

318
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,240
as people pushing for change to be

319
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,360
distracted by tactics by this

320
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:57,120
administration or

321
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:59,760
even well-intentioned but flawed um

322
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,760
uh peers

323
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,719
thank you thanks so much for that it's

324
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:08,880
um absolutely central

325
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,720
to this discussion and i think um

326
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,560
you know more broadly across the world

327
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,040
actually as well we've seen

328
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:16,479
um you know the sort of like

329
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,680
concentration i think

330
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,839
of power i mean afghani morozov said

331
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,399
some time ago that um back in 2010 and

332
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:28,560
2011 the technology was actually going

333
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:31,760
to be the enabler of the autocrat

334
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,000
and and and um i was through all those i

335
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,920
think you were as well

336
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,440
um judging by some of the responses that

337
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,360
i've seen in in the work that you've

338
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,600
done rasheeda

339
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:47,200
in the response to tendai trumay's

340
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,240
report on race

341
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:52,079
injustice um and technology

342
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,680
in fact she actually as i indicated in

343
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,120
the opening she she issued a whole

344
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:59,359
report to the general assembly

345
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,800
just on this matter and demonstrated how

346
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,880
it's not just about the dysfunctional

347
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,719
conversation that happens on twitter for

348
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,680
instance actually about the inherent

349
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,360
racial racism that's in the technology

350
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,079
infrastructure can you talk to that for

351
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,240
a second

352
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:16,800
and i know that you also helped to craft

353
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,240
a statement in support of that

354
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,160
report and there's a number of

355
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:22,639
recommendations in there one of which

356
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,240
is that racist technology should be

357
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,079
banned i mean i think that's your first

358
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:27,920
recommendation it would be great to hear

359
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:31,359
about that in the context of

360
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,360
the us yeah yeah

361
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:34,480
and actually i think this is kind of the

362
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,399
global problem with

363
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:39,199
tech development and just its

364
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,399
proliferation in government and society

365
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,240
is that technology and data which is the

366
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,639
core for what a lot of these newer

367
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
technologies are based on are often seen

368
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,760
as

369
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:50,959
a historical or apolitical and i think

370
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,839
when you ignore

371
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:54,560
or even erase what are really deeply

372
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:57,120
cultural

373
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:59,359
and political significant histories then

374
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,680
the threats posed by these technologies

375
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:01,920
and

376
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,120
new data practices seem new seem

377
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:06,000
complicated and seem

378
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:07,360
different from the social context in

379
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,360
which they're embedded

380
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,199
but they're part of that history and

381
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:13,199
often in some ways they're helping

382
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,359
conceal and perpetuate the problems we

383
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,000
see so in the statement that we put out

384
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,120
in support

385
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:22,480
of what's really a profound report

386
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,880
um we're sort of supporting these calls

387
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,880
for

388
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,920
changes and some of them is also trying

389
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,839
to expand

390
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,439
what we're seeing as racially biased

391
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,639
technologies because i think a lot of

392
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,480
the public discourse

393
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,399
focuses a lot on facial recognition

394
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,920
which is problematic and we can go into

395
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,680
that into great detail

396
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,560
but it's not the only problematic

397
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,638
technology it's part of this cycle

398
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,479
of like tech solutionism that's within

399
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,880
the tech industry of thinking

400
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,920
what are really complex and nuanced

401
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,760
social issues

402
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,079
can be easily fixed by some data

403
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,880
application or some new technology

404
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:56,160
but not thinking about whose world views

405
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,399
that that is sort of

406
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:00,000
instilling and what are we optimizing

407
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,440
for with a lot of these technologies

408
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,360
since most of them are

409
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,360
optimation technologies

410
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,560
and what's really interesting and maybe

411
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,439
i can bring anthony in here as well you

412
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,638
talk about

413
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,279
tech solutionism as being part of the

414
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,399
solution

415
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:19,439
the report actually squarely places

416
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:21,440
the cause of the problem or the

417
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,680
exacerbator of the problem

418
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:26,880
at the at the front doorstep or at the

419
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,758
feet of the tech giants um

420
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,759
and and and i think when we start also

421
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,600
to look at things like

422
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:35,360
um digital identity when it's not just

423
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,040
about your content that you're

424
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,839
that you're uploading or downloading

425
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,319
it's actually about your very digital

426
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,759
identity

427
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,519
your identity the way in which you

428
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,320
operate online and with this rapid

429
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:46,639
digital acceleration um so anthony tell

430
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,040
us

431
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,240
i mean if any reflections on you know

432
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,319
rashida's comments and

433
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:54,399
also like thinking about the role of

434
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,240
technology in the achievement or denial

435
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,240
of civil and political rights

436
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
sure definitely i mean that's another

437
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,759
big question but glad to try and tackle

438
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,120
and also get your own thoughts

439
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:05,440
because mine are still evolving and

440
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:07,040
being informed but first i very much

441
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,759
want to echo and appreciate

442
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,880
rasheeda's kind of point that it's not

443
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:13,120
just

444
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,880
one technology that's a problem like

445
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,519
facial recognition but it's the way in

446
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,040
which these

447
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,199
the these technologies are developed the

448
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,759
ubiquitousness

449
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,000
in our daily lives that is increasingly

450
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,920
of concern to us and we've taken

451
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,920
you know very strong stances against the

452
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:29,519
use of facial recognition technologies

453
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,319
especially in law enforcement

454
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,160
and we had recently the case of one man

455
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,880
who was arrested

456
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,000
based on kind of a false facial

457
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:39,839
recognition match

458
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,360
we've been kind of pushing this i know

459
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,160
this has been an issue brethren you

460
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:46,240
know better than i but uh and it's not a

461
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,079
surprise then that the the false

462
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:50,000
matches the false positives end up being

463
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,839
much more about people of color

464
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,360
and their kind of the racial

465
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,079
inaccuracies around

466
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:57,600
facial recognition just underscores the

467
00:16:56,079 --> 00:17:00,239
problem when you deal with

468
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,880
facial recognition in an already a

469
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,680
racist

470
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,359
criminal justice system oh my god it's

471
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,559
just kind of adding more

472
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,399
more wood onto an out of control fire so

473
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:13,280
i i think we need to kind of really

474
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,760
unpack it and see it as as much as we

475
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,520
can

476
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,199
my own thinking has evolved i mean i

477
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,720
appreciate being able to see you and

478
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:20,160
spend time with you

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:22,240
you know and you and i first met years

480
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:25,600
ago i had very much thought

481
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,039
in kind of a very binary way

482
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:29,520
that there was the digital world and

483
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,600
then there was the real world and

484
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,440
you know i had a digital program and

485
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,918
then i had the rest of my program i had

486
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,520
digital organizers and i had other pro

487
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,960
other organizers i had digital

488
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,320
fundraisers and then i had

489
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,160
other fundraisers i want to say that you

490
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,639
were totally right that that distinction

491
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,760
makes

492
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:51,600
absolutely no sense and i'm now living

493
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:54,400
in a kind of a fused digital

494
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,080
real world where it's all the same and

495
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,360
one of the same and it doesn't make much

496
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,199
difference and i was stuck

497
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,399
i was struck by just especially in the

498
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,720
events uh

499
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,640
from the after the murder of george

500
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,120
floyd and the protests

501
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:09,280
of acro across the country uh about

502
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,799
police murder police abu brutality of

503
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,399
black communities

504
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:13,840
i was struck in some jurisdictions we

505
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,559
read about they're taking down the cell

506
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,720
towers

507
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,160
right so that the the protesters in real

508
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,720
time couldn't communicate with each

509
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,640
other

510
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,160
couldn't text couldn't upload their

511
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,360
pictures or videos

512
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,440
it kind of reminded me of the

513
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,360
conversations i had with colleagues in

514
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:30,080
in egypt the egyptian initiative for

515
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
personal rights eipr and gasser my

516
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,120
counterpart there about

517
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,559
yeah that's exactly what they did to

518
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,360
rear square i mean you know this really

519
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,799
well

520
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:42,080
and and then then looking about how

521
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:44,480
the the space of organizing is

522
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:46,159
very much all now tied with physical

523
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,320
organizing with digital organizing

524
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:50,240
digital identity and physical

525
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:52,080
space and it's all playing out in

526
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:54,160
portland you know in real time

527
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,080
and you know i think that these

528
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:57,679
distinctions i once held between there's

529
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,600
the digital programs and digital

530
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:01,520
strategies and the real strategies and

531
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,760
the real world strategy

532
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,600
it's all all a jumble and it's all going

533
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,760
to be addressed as one big

534
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,600
kind of part of a way that the

535
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
government is both interfacing and

536
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,399
reacting and controlling

537
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:15,918
and i think we have to begin i say in my

538
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,720
own organization we have to infuse

539
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:19,919
kind of a sophistication and knowledge

540
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:22,080
of

541
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,240
kind of the the virtual world in each

542
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:26,960
and every single aspect of our programs

543
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,280
and that has come out in the litigation

544
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,320
we brought recently against facebook

545
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,320
on the discrimination uh on their

546
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,439
algorithm their advertising

547
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,360
based on housing credit and employment

548
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,960
i've had to infuse kind of an

549
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,719
understanding of these algorithms in my

550
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,919
racial justice project and my women's

551
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,520
rights project

552
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,559
it wasn't enough for me to just have

553
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:49,520
this work sit in a technology project it

554
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,520
really needed to be

555
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,559
in all other places and in the clovid

556
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,799
moment i can't tell you

557
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:55,840
that the the kind of conversations i've

558
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,400
been having

559
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,000
where you know the titans of tech who

560
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:03,600
usually run from the hills

561
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:05,679
from me uh were chasing me down to have

562
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,320
a one-on-one conversation so that they

563
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,600
could

564
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:12,960
kind of cajole me or

565
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:16,480
bludgeon me or corner me into supporting

566
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:18,559
these web-based contact tracing apps

567
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:20,559
right literally i mean i don't kiss and

568
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,280
tell otherwise there's no way there's no

569
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:24,158
way to live in

570
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,480
in my my job in my life but some of them

571
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:27,440
were

572
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:29,360
all out altercations with raised voices

573
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:32,640
where they were basically saying to me

574
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,360
unless you get behind one of these

575
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,360
apps and these technologies blood will

576
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,039
be on your hands and people will die as

577
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,678
a result of it and i just thought you

578
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,840
know

579
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
my job is to raise the the civil

580
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,559
liberties the privacy concerns on these

581
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:46,559
technologies

582
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:49,200
especially as they relate to communities

583
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,678
that don't have advocates i remember one

584
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:53,039
tech titan who's worth a fortune saying

585
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,919
to me i said look

586
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:57,120
this is the molotov cocktail that is my

587
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:59,600
biggest nightmare

588
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,840
it's personal identifiable information

589
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:04,320
it's possibly

590
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:07,039
funded by and accessed by

591
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:09,039
the federal government it's broadcast to

592
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:11,760
one's neighbors

593
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,158
it is it is in these smartphones that

594
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,919
you

595
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:16,240
most people don't fully understand the

596
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,320
terms of service when they upload

597
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,480
any app you know that you've got to

598
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,600
allow me the skepticism and the worry

599
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,640
and the concern

600
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,879
oh anthony the the covid pandemic is the

601
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,840
great equalizer we're all getting it

602
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,360
equally

603
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,840
this is like in the first week of it i'm

604
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,280
like i bet you

605
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,399
that it's communities of color and

606
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,080
low-income communities who are really

607
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,840
going to bear the brunt of this

608
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,280
and then when the first study came out

609
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,158
in early

610
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,760
early april late march that it was black

611
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:46,320
and latino communities that were really

612
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:47,039
affected by the cobit pandemic and dying

613
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:49,120
and

614
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,640
contracting disease at greater rates

615
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,559
than the white communities

616
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,559
because of the essential job

617
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:58,000
classifications and other

618
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,720
systemic racism in the health of our

619
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,320
communities then the conversation shut

620
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,320
down saying this is the reason why we

621
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:06,799
have to be skeptical because

622
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,639
the the the impact of a pandemic on

623
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,799
certain communities would be greater

624
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,080
or worse depending on who you are and

625
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:13,918
that these technologies are not going to

626
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,600
be the great equalizer and no disease is

627
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:17,760
a great equalizer in an uneven

628
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,199
and unequal playing field so we really

629
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,200
need to take it all apart and take it

630
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:23,280
back together again brett i think it's

631
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:26,400
it's essential and we need to do it and

632
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:28,879
to help us with uh

633
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
well thank you i mean i think we we you

634
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:33,600
know we're doing this all in real time

635
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:35,200
uh and and and and i wanted to come back

636
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,639
to i mean this anthony so much that you

637
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,159
said then i'm sure rasheeda

638
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:40,240
has a number of points that she'd like

639
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:42,080
to raise as well let me just bring us

640
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,559
back to the right to protest because i

641
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,320
think

642
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,480
it was a very very interesting

643
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,799
development that happened

644
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,640
in the last couple of days where the

645
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,080
special rapporteur actually at wright's

646
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,880
con

647
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:56,720
talked to this new or not this new but

648
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:00,080
to this concept of the fusing

649
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,159
of the right to political protest um

650
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,760
as a as a human right that needs to be

651
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:05,840
protected in the digital environment and

652
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:08,000
in fact we've been talking about this

653
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:09,039
um anthony as you know and rasheed has

654
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,600
been talking about this for a long time

655
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,879
but really since you know

656
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:14,959
the resolution of the human rights

657
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,640
council back in 2012 basically said that

658
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,280
human rights apply online equally as

659
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,480
they do

660
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,960
offline and and and part of

661
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,640
and part of the the issue here i think

662
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:26,640
is that organizations

663
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:28,159
that were born as civil rights

664
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:31,200
organizations or civil and political

665
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:31,200
rights organizations

666
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,360
didn't really know perhaps how to handle

667
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,280
that transition in fact there was

668
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,479
activists as you say in tahrir square

669
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,918
and other places that quickly understood

670
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,840
that that immediately understood that

671
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,039
and i think many of the organizations

672
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,959
the traditional human rights

673
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:52,080
organizations have struggled with

674
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:56,640
trying to fuse technology onto

675
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:58,080
their programs and let me just ask you

676
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,000
you know you mentioned some of the work

677
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,320
that you're doing at the aclu

678
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,279
and it goes all the way from you know

679
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,559
fighting for equal

680
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:06,320
for equal rights for same-sex

681
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:09,520
relationships um

682
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:10,480
through to you know the the the the

683
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:13,600
algorithm

684
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:14,559
um and the the kind of the human rights

685
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,559
implications of

686
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,320
the of the black box of the algorithm in

687
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:22,960
many of the tech platforms

688
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:26,320
how do you how does your team

689
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,559
make a decision on the battles

690
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:30,960
that you want to fight because in the

691
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,399
u.s context there are so many i mean you

692
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:34,720
listed off 10 i think

693
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
in the last intervention what's the

694
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,240
what's the what's your secret

695
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,400
what's your secret source here because i

696
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:43,039
think many of us look to the aclu

697
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,840
as sort of gold standards like the first

698
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,760
thing that we saw

699
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,600
like when trump came into power was like

700
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,158
the ads the next day which said

701
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,760
see you in court tell us about the

702
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:53,679
prioritizing and rashida i'd like to get

703
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,320
your take on this as well because we're

704
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,240
all meeting

705
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:58,320
we're all under a lot of pressure as

706
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,360
civil and political rights organizations

707
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:02,639
we're struggling with that

708
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,639
decision-making process

709
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,879
you know i would just say first off on

710
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:09,279
the i think we're doing

711
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,600
a fair job of wrapping our minds around

712
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:13,200
the interface between technologies and

713
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,879
the traditional civil rights and civil

714
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
liberties issues we work on

715
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,679
i think we're further along than many of

716
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,799
our sister organizations i think we've

717
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,720
been blessed

718
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:23,120
in that early on my colleague said to me

719
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:25,120
look we have nobody who understands code

720
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,199
and you agree to hire a bunch of

721
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:29,600
technologists on staff we have lots of

722
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,440
lobbyists we have lots of litigators

723
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:33,199
we have lots of comms and organizers but

724
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:35,520
no one who understands code and

725
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,600
i think that switched it must have been

726
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:40,000
around six seven years ago

727
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,559
where we now have had series of kind of

728
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:44,720
generations of technologists who are on

729
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:46,000
our payroll who give us real knowledge

730
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,880
on the inside has really made a

731
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,440
difference

732
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,039
um the way we ask our you know how we

733
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,080
decide where we're gonna go we asked

734
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:54,879
three

735
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:57,120
simple questions that really are hard to

736
00:25:54,880 --> 00:26:00,880
answer just you know how important

737
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,918
is it every injustice is important to

738
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,080
the person that's

739
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,679
affected or implicated but then you've

740
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,320
really got to battle it out and say

741
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,799
define

742
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:10,399
why it's really important for a larger

743
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:12,320
group of people we're not a

744
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,520
direct services organization so we have

745
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,320
to think about

746
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:18,000
broader impact broader importance

747
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,039
broader systemic change

748
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,679
and you know and we decide we do indeed

749
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:25,840
we do defend and we provide

750
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,360
representation to individuals

751
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,199
but we have to answer the importance

752
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,959
question like the the representation we

753
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:33,360
gave to edward snowden

754
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,200
it was one guy but had massive

755
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:37,840
implications and importance

756
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:39,919
uh to the whole world i think and one of

757
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:43,039
the best decisions we ever made was to

758
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:44,559
get behind ed snowden and i was lucky to

759
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:46,960
have met him that first time in

760
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,158
moscow when he was just becoming a

761
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:50,480
client of the aclu

762
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:53,039
second question is so you know it's

763
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,640
important you define how it's important

764
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:56,400
do you have a theory of change there's

765
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,000
lots of things that i think are really

766
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
important that i have no theory of

767
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,799
change

768
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:02,720
and i don't run a church or a synagogue

769
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:06,158
or a mosque right this is not about

770
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,360
belief in prayer this is about real

771
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:10,799
pragmatic change that we have to

772
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,240
move the ball down the field if you use

773
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,760
a sports better for so you have to be

774
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,080
able to define

775
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,520
how you're going to make a difference so

776
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,039
for instance one issue that's important

777
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,279
but i have no theory of change right now

778
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:22,559
in the u.s is the mon is the role of

779
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,080
money in politics

780
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,840
i think money corrupts i think

781
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:27,439
politicians can be bought and sold for

782
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,959
too cheap too easily

783
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,960
but i think in the aftermath of the

784
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:33,200
supreme court decision in citizens

785
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,679
united i have no real theory of change

786
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,600
and

787
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,120
other than public financing but that's

788
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,639
not going to happen

789
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,320
at the national level given this

790
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:41,840
composition of congress and given the

791
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,080
economy that we're in so

792
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:45,678
don't do much if anything on campaign

793
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:47,678
finance critically important

794
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:48,960
but it falls the second question the

795
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,720
third one is

796
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,960
what do we do that's distinct or

797
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,960
additive because i really believe that

798
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,559
while the aclu is a great organization

799
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,919
and we've got about 2 000 staff

800
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,399
nationwide

801
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,360
we're still david to the government's

802
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,039
goliath

803
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:05,760
so we've got it we can reinvent the

804
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:07,919
wheel there is no room for competition

805
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,440
there is no room for duplicative efforts

806
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,039
we've really got to think about

807
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:13,120
what it is that we're doing that is

808
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:15,520
distinct additive

809
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:18,080
what's the net add on to these set of

810
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,639
issues or topics or strategies

811
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:21,600
and work it out with our peers and our

812
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:24,240
colleagues

813
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:26,240
in in the fight for justice you know in

814
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:28,799
the lgbt context i do very little

815
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,520
federal lobbying on lgbt advocacy on the

816
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,879
hill

817
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,559
human rights campaign fund does that

818
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,120
beautifully uh

819
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:37,039
alfonso david and his whole team is

820
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:38,719
largely focused on federal advocacy on

821
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:41,039
lgbt communities i have

822
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:42,399
a part of one lobbyist i think point

823
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:45,200
three of one lobbyist that

824
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:46,959
looks at lgbt issues on the hill where i

825
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,600
have a unique advantage is being able to

826
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:51,200
do lgbt advocacy in some of the states

827
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,199
where we're the only organization with

828
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,080
an office on the ground in every state

829
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:58,080
and boots on the ground the c3 being tax

830
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:00,320
deductible and c4 the political arm in

831
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,120
every state so i prefer to do much more

832
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,279
of the lgbt advocacy in the states than

833
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,559
try to work necessarily

834
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,640
on the hill or congress that's an

835
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,158
example of how we ask is it important

836
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:11,760
do we have a theory of change and is

837
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:13,200
what we do additive and

838
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,919
and make sure that we're not duplicative

839
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,159
but what yeah so let so let me ju

840
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:19,760
thanks for that and it's i you know as

841
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:22,159
also an executive director of an

842
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:24,399
organization having to make similar

843
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:26,080
decisions all the time you know like

844
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:29,279
just look at what's happening

845
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,678
this week in hungary um with you know

846
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,039
the

847
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:35,760
the the firing of the ceo of

848
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:36,320
index and the you know basically all the

849
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,919
staff

850
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,439
all hundred staff editorial staff

851
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,760
resigning

852
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:43,520
what's happening in hong kong uh as you

853
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,279
know just the national security law and

854
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:48,320
the first time that's being used i think

855
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:50,240
against the social media user i mean

856
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:51,840
you know this crazy list i want to ask

857
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:54,320
rasheeda um

858
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:55,279
i i think for and this is a critique for

859
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:58,000
us as well as

860
00:29:55,279 --> 00:29:58,720
at access now and i think for many civil

861
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
and political

862
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,760
organizations or human rights

863
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,320
organizations that are focused on the

864
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,399
human

865
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,520
rights element in sort of determining

866
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,000
the hierarchy

867
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:08,559
um but the racial justice piece i think

868
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,919
has

869
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:13,600
perhaps been missing um and we've had a

870
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:16,399
lot of internal discussion

871
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,678
and access now about how to like face

872
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:20,080
how to actually be

873
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:22,080
not just a multi-racial organization but

874
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,439
to be an organization that's actively

875
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:27,120
committed to

876
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,760
fight racism um give us some

877
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:30,239
give us your thoughts on that um and you

878
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,120
know

879
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:33,600
be be frank please um as you are on sort

880
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:35,439
of

881
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,360
guiding some of the organizations are

882
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,440
advising or critiquing us on

883
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:41,840
you know how to how to move forward in

884
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:44,000
the right direction on this

885
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,279
yes so i think as someone that made that

886
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,960
critique

887
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:49,919
i should probably explain some of it and

888
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,000
i think it can help give some context to

889
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,919
some of the recommendations i have

890
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:56,240
on how to center racial justice when

891
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:57,840
doing civil rights and human rights work

892
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,080
and i think one of the major problems

893
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,399
with what you just said is a tendency to

894
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,399
do

895
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:04,000
legal analysis in a way that looks at

896
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:06,239
rights and liberties through a

897
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:07,519
hierarchical frame which means that some

898
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,600
are prioritized

899
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,440
over others when making these critical

900
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,559
decisions about organizational

901
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,320
priorities

902
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,879
um but i think the other problem is that

903
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:20,240
a lot of the analysis of facts and the

904
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,440
law tend to be both

905
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,640
power blind and colorblind so

906
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,840
the evaluations of harm risk of harm and

907
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,880
even the long-term

908
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:31,279
impacts become abstracted or

909
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,279
universalized

910
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:35,120
um to such an extreme that it doesn't

911
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:37,840
actually reflect the lived realities of

912
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:41,039
those who are most directly impacted

913
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:43,199
and um an example of this and

914
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:45,679
it works sorry another problem with that

915
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:47,440
too is it can also lead to some of those

916
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:50,240
problems persisting

917
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,320
and i think a good example and that's on

918
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,919
topic with this conference is looking at

919
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,678
the rhetoric and narrative around

920
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:56,399
surveillance over the past couple of

921
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,480
decades

922
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,080
and i think it wasn't until the past

923
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,559
couple of years that the

924
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,720
focus of both legal challenges and

925
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:07,200
critiques of surveillance

926
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:09,200
practices have expand beyond just

927
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,200
privacy rights and intrusions

928
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,039
and are now starting to look at equity

929
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,679
and racial justice framings

930
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,879
but i think one of the problems with the

931
00:32:15,679 --> 00:32:19,120
sort of myopic

932
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,159
privacy focus is it makes it seem like

933
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:21,760
the risk of harm

934
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,200
is equal for all when we know the

935
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:25,200
reality is that

936
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:27,679
um these practices target certain

937
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,480
communities and certain groups of people

938
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,279
and i think one of the long-term harms

939
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,840
that stem

940
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,679
stems from this approach is that we also

941
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,519
tend to miss

942
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:39,200
other forms of oppressive government

943
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,240
practices or even other forms of

944
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,000
surveillance so

945
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:44,000
this is why we don't see the same level

946
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,480
of public outcry

947
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,320
or even legal challenges to practices by

948
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,320
child welfare and public benefits

949
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:52,799
agencies even though they have equally

950
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:54,879
invasive practices as law enforcement

951
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,799
and they disproportionately burden poor

952
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:59,600
people in black and brown communities

953
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,158
so i think within that context the best

954
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:03,199
way

955
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,279
to approach or at least center racial

956
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
justice when thinking about civil rights

957
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,159
in

958
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:09,039
civil liberties issues or human rights

959
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,279
frames

960
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:12,158
is first you have to review the facts

961
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,760
and do legal

962
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,760
analysis in a way that's grounded in

963
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,080
reality and it's specifically paying

964
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,919
attention to the actual harms and risk

965
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,760
facing marginalized communities rather

966
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,279
than the perceived harm to all

967
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,879
because that leads to the disconnect i

968
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:27,679
was just describing

969
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,799
and then i think that legal and often

970
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:30,960
policy analysis

971
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,559
also needs to include power and racial

972
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
analysis

973
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:37,200
um paying particular attention to the

974
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,919
relational aspects of each

975
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,880
um and not just on a local level but you

976
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:43,039
need to look at this

977
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,880
locally nationally and in a global

978
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:46,240
context and then the last point which i

979
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:48,399
think aligns with

980
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,840
some of what anthony was describing is

981
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:51,120
that we have to start developing

982
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,760
proactive approaches

983
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,279
to preserving rights and liberties and

984
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,360
advancing our civil rights and civil

985
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,919
liberties because to date so much of our

986
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,918
work

987
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:01,600
has been reactive where we're reacting

988
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:03,200
to new forms of government oppression

989
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:04,240
reacting to new technological

990
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,080
advancements

991
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,000
but this can ultimately serve to

992
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
stagnate the necessary structural and

993
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:12,480
systemic reform

994
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:14,720
and it also hinders our ability to sort

995
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,560
of imagine radical alternatives

996
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,480
that don't preserve the hierarchies that

997
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,040
exist in our society so i think it needs

998
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,440
to be

999
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,719
a sort of conglomerate of all of those

1000
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,200
approaches at once

1001
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:27,118
to really focus on who is harmed and

1002
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:28,560
what is the change that's necessary to

1003
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,879
ensure that society is meant for

1004
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:33,918
everyone

1005
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,759
i think the one thing i would add

1006
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:38,000
to rashida's point about the need for

1007
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,679
thinking about how these

1008
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,599
you know how these technologies are how

1009
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,280
these tactics or concerns

1010
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:45,040
affect especially communities of color

1011
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,079
because there's differences in power and

1012
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,599
access

1013
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,679
to to to pulling the levers

1014
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:54,480
i think back of the the litigation we

1015
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:56,240
did in the aftermath of 911

1016
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:58,160
uh that was targeting the fbi

1017
00:34:56,239 --> 00:35:00,399
surveillance of mosques

1018
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:02,480
right and part of what's interesting for

1019
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,280
me at the aclu is i have all these silos

1020
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:05,040
i have the

1021
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,359
national security project i have the

1022
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:09,440
lgbt project i have the technology and

1023
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:11,680
speech project i have the racial justice

1024
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,640
project i have the lgbt project

1025
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,200
reproductive freedom when i begin to see

1026
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:19,839
kind of a porousness across my projects

1027
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,359
when i begin to think this is what we

1028
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:23,599
need to kind of effectuate

1029
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,759
externally of the organization the

1030
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:27,599
surveillance of mosque work was very

1031
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,200
much focused in the national security

1032
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,160
context with a lot of the memsa

1033
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,399
communities

1034
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:33,680
who were targeted by the fbi for the

1035
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,920
surveillance

1036
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,839
and it would in a different world you

1037
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,520
would have seen much more

1038
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:45,279
of my kind of surveillance constituents

1039
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,920
my privacy wonks you know my dpgs of the

1040
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,079
world

1041
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,599
right who would have been equally

1042
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,240
swarming the field

1043
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:53,520
with the with the muslim uh the

1044
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:56,000
surveillance of the mosques

1045
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,280
and of the islamic centers i think

1046
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,119
similarly on

1047
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:00,640
right now playing out in portland it's

1048
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,960
it's fascinating to me

1049
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,240
you know the these thugs who are being

1050
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:07,520
deployed without

1051
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,040
uh uh insignias who are arresting

1052
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:10,640
protesters and

1053
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,599
throwing them in the back of unmarked

1054
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,000
cars which my counterparts in russia

1055
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:17,599
and elsewhere are saying welcome to the

1056
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,119
club right i'm like i never thought i'd

1057
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:21,280
see this in america but this is what's

1058
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:22,720
happening on our streets

1059
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,119
part of what's so fascinating so my

1060
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:26,799
first amendment kind of like aficionados

1061
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:29,359
if you will my zealots on the first

1062
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,680
amendment in free speech and protests

1063
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:33,040
are finally understanding and seeing in

1064
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,520
real time

1065
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,720
the terrorism that border communities

1066
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:39,599
especially latinos

1067
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,040
along the u.s mexican border communities

1068
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:43,599
have experienced

1069
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,880
at the hands of customs and border

1070
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:48,320
protection cpb

1071
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:51,040
right these are out of control thugs

1072
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:52,560
terrorizing communities that we have

1073
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:55,200
seen in colonias

1074
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:57,200
all along the u.s mexican border except

1075
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:59,919
now we're seeing it in portland

1076
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:01,680
right and that's where i feel like and i

1077
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,640
don't like the word intersectionality

1078
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,480
because it's

1079
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,160
unless you define it it just feels like

1080
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:08,960
a good a good feel-good

1081
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:10,640
buzzword but this really does underscore

1082
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,320
the need for thinking about these issues

1083
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,879
in a much more connected way i think in

1084
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,560
the

1085
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,000
especially on the set of issues that you

1086
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,078
work on brett

1087
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,620
critically important to infuse it up

1088
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,480
everywhere

1089
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:23,200
[Music]

1090
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:24,800
yeah thank you i mean i i have to agree

1091
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:26,240
with you and i'm i'm actually hoping

1092
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,599
that this conversation will

1093
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,520
move to like a three-day um hangout for

1094
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,720
the three of us or 20 of us to be able

1095
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,599
to sit down and have

1096
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:36,240
you know a full analysis of like where

1097
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:39,280
we're at

1098
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:41,919
right now in terms of being you know in

1099
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:45,119
the kind of civil and political

1100
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,119
rights um

1101
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,960
like a cohort of organizations that can

1102
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:50,480
actually talk through some of this stuff

1103
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:51,280
because i feel like the comments rashida

1104
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:54,640
that you make

1105
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
about um not just about racial justice

1106
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:57,680
issues but

1107
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:59,440
but about like a systemic analysis of

1108
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,919
how we're operating like we can only get

1109
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,839
better

1110
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:04,240
and i feel i feel like there's a lot a

1111
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:07,440
lot of work to be done

1112
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,839
internally and externally

1113
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,040
the problem is as we sort of indicated

1114
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:12,480
earlier is like much of this is

1115
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,200
happening in real time and i want to

1116
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,760
throw in the kobit 19

1117
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,480
pandemic into this discussion because i

1118
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,839
feel

1119
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:23,440
as though um you know what was already a

1120
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:26,320
crisis moment has become

1121
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,960
a crisis moment you know with a viral

1122
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:32,400
component to it and i would love to hear

1123
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,359
rasheeda from you um you know what you

1124
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:36,560
think

1125
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,598
the pandemic has actually done to

1126
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,400
um to america and i mean

1127
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:43,280
obviously again a big question but how

1128
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:46,320
has this

1129
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,440
this how has this unfurled so

1130
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,119
dramatically and and and and horribly

1131
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,720
uh and i don't know if i'm breaking up

1132
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,040
there but can you still hear me

1133
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:59,839
yes you can hear me uh yeah yep

1134
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:01,279
so um i just saw myself turned into a

1135
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:02,078
fold on screen which is always

1136
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,599
concerning

1137
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,440
um particularly when you're doing a live

1138
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,359
interview but regardless

1139
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:09,119
um rashida can you could you jump in

1140
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:10,560
there and let us know like what you

1141
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:12,240
what you're seeing and sort of how it

1142
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:15,440
plays for instance in terms of like

1143
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,040
you know contract tracing apps or um

1144
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,480
you know those sort of decisions around

1145
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,599
some of the thinking around immunity

1146
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:23,680
passports perhaps

1147
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:25,839
okay i'm going to take this in two parts

1148
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,879
because that was a lot of questions

1149
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,880
um yeah i think

1150
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:35,200
i think one benefit of really what's

1151
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:37,439
been a crazy

1152
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:39,359
year this year is it's forcing a lot of

1153
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:42,800
conversations that

1154
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:44,400
we as a community public don't want to

1155
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:45,920
have and i think it's part of the

1156
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:47,680
problem in this country is that people

1157
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,640
don't want to face the ugliness of our

1158
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,640
history

1159
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,160
and how that history developed our

1160
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,279
current conditions

1161
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:57,200
um and so you'll see different actors

1162
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,760
use coded language or even what i was

1163
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:02,560
describing earlier of this

1164
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:05,839
universalizing or obfuscation of many of

1165
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:08,240
the important issues we're facing today

1166
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:09,920
and that just makes it easy to ignore

1167
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:12,078
especially if you're not directly

1168
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:13,520
affected or even benefiting from the

1169
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:16,160
status quo and i think

1170
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:16,960
what's happening now with covet is we're

1171
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,118
being forced

1172
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:20,240
to have these conversations because it's

1173
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:22,160
not by

1174
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,919
accident that black and brown

1175
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,440
communities are disproportionately

1176
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:28,160
affected by

1177
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:29,760
the pandemic or by many of the other

1178
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:31,920
sort of related effects

1179
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,800
that being the economy and many other

1180
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:35,040
issues

1181
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,880
um but i also think we need to start

1182
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:39,119
talking more critically

1183
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:40,400
about issues like segregation in our

1184
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:42,640
country because i think

1185
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:44,480
that directly relates to a lot of the

1186
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:46,720
problems that we're seeing being

1187
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,000
exacerbated by covid19

1188
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,359
and many of the related issues um

1189
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,680
and i think all of this in order for us

1190
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,839
to

1191
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:57,520
undo any of this or to address this in a

1192
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,160
critical way it's going to take a lot of

1193
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:00,319
deep

1194
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:02,078
internal work as you mentioned threat

1195
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:04,000
for both individuals and

1196
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,920
institutions because what we're talking

1197
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,359
about are issues of culture and

1198
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,160
accountability

1199
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,240
and we're currently living in a culture

1200
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:13,598
that's driven by capitalism and white

1201
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,919
supremacy so

1202
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:17,920
yes we need legal reforms and they're

1203
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,520
definitely necessary but what does legal

1204
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,000
reform mean when the law has been a

1205
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,839
primary

1206
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,680
tool for creating our current sort of

1207
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:26,160
state of racial inequity

1208
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,000
and that's also why i think we need to

1209
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,879
critically engage with accountability

1210
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:31,680
because if the

1211
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:33,760
traditional terms or mechanisms that we

1212
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,799
look to for accountability or even

1213
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,960
redress

1214
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,800
don't necessarily work for all than what

1215
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:40,640
necessarily needs to change

1216
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:42,240
so that we can have a more inclusive

1217
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:45,759
society and then as far

1218
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,439
as the contact tracing um i think

1219
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:50,560
it's been interesting because i actually

1220
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,720
did work on hiv issues and

1221
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:54,078
once the contact tracing acts came up a

1222
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:55,520
lot of people reached out to me and were

1223
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:57,040
like what do you think how does this

1224
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,920
connect to hiv

1225
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,279
and i just saw this complete disconnect

1226
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,359
because it seemed to not

1227
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:05,520
understand both what is the actual

1228
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,839
practice around contact tracing

1229
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,880
in a non-digital way around infectious

1230
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,960
diseases right now

1231
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,040
and how does adding a digital

1232
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,160
application either exacerbate the

1233
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,440
problems of

1234
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,839
existing sort of analog practices or

1235
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,640
even undo what is helpful about those

1236
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,720
practices

1237
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,640
and i think um one of the pieces that

1238
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:26,640
misses from a lot of the conversations

1239
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,759
when we discuss contact tracing is the

1240
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,319
role of stigma

1241
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:31,760
and i think kovid definitely still has a

1242
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:34,800
lot of stigma to it

1243
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:37,920
and that sort of undoes or

1244
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,400
can inhibit any type of proactive

1245
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,359
public health sort of approach and i

1246
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,160
think the

1247
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:46,240
sort of turn to contact tracing apps

1248
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:48,399
fits into what i was discussing earlier

1249
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,319
of this problem with tech solutionism in

1250
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:52,000
that tech companies think they can just

1251
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:54,640
apply data at scale

1252
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,280
and solve really complex issues and then

1253
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:57,440
we're now

1254
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,880
seeing with many states and local

1255
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:00,560
governments applying these apps that

1256
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:02,240
they just simply don't work in our

1257
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,799
action and probably are contributing

1258
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:05,359
more

1259
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,319
to the increase in infection and death

1260
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:08,319
rates that we're seeing

1261
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,759
thanks so much for your comments um

1262
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,079
there

1263
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,040
i think we um at accessnow we've also

1264
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:22,800
released

1265
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,720
you know a number of papers on

1266
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,000
firstly this is like massive collection

1267
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:27,839
of data

1268
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,040
and we put out a report on the do's and

1269
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:32,400
don'ts of data

1270
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,079
collection in the context of kovid

1271
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,079
and then try to translate that

1272
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:41,520
over to to contact tracing and now also

1273
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:44,000
on immunity passports

1274
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:45,280
and and one of the things that we first

1275
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,119
try to analyze

1276
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:50,400
is uh whether the

1277
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:53,520
you know whether these things actually

1278
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:55,280
work and and you talk about hiv and the

1279
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,040
way in which hiv

1280
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,880
you know so this sort of this idea was

1281
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,240
like if we can collect all of the data

1282
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,040
and we can actually apply it in a way um

1283
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:07,200
that um gives health professionals

1284
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:09,359
access to it all but also

1285
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:11,520
national security or security services

1286
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:14,160
or plus also you know the administration

1287
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,079
then we can actually trace those who

1288
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:18,078
you know who are infected or at risk of

1289
00:44:16,079 --> 00:44:19,680
infection but the manual

1290
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:21,280
contact tracing that came before

1291
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:23,598
technology was

1292
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,480
like is a very very complicated and

1293
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:27,920
intrusive

1294
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,599
um approach to health

1295
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:31,280
and i think that you know we're just

1296
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:32,560
sort of like doing this in real time

1297
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:34,560
brought the technology in

1298
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:36,319
and now we're dealing with things like

1299
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,599
you know significant data leakage

1300
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,279
and the collection of personally

1301
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,319
identifiable information that we don't

1302
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,480
really need

1303
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,839
no strategies for deletion of that data

1304
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,599
no question about

1305
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:47,599
how a person can actually provide

1306
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:50,400
consent or otherwise so

1307
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:52,880
um so anthony over to you on this let's

1308
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,000
talk about kobit 19 in the context of

1309
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:59,440
of rights in the u.s

1310
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,880
yeah a couple of things i mean first

1311
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,800
let's stick with the contact tracings

1312
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,440
for some level of continuity we can the

1313
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:05,040
con

1314
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,200
the web-based apps for contact trading

1315
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:09,040
please yeah i mean i i

1316
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:10,640
you know we've issued i think at least

1317
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:13,040
two white papers also asking the

1318
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,000
questions and laying out the principles

1319
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:17,520
for how these web-based apps might work

1320
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,040
if we deploy them

1321
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:21,359
and again it's our effort to try to be

1322
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:24,720
constructive um

1323
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:26,560
there were pressures uh externally

1324
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:28,399
internally i think we were all aligned

1325
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:31,599
that we did not want to

1326
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:32,240
bless any one technology or one approach

1327
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:34,640
or one

1328
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:36,399
group of researchers and scientists

1329
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:39,839
there was a mad scramble

1330
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,680
to to get us to uh

1331
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,960
to bless a particular project or

1332
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:44,560
endeavor and we're just like look we'll

1333
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:46,319
raise the questions and we're gonna

1334
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:47,599
audit them independently we'll continue

1335
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,079
to be critical if we need

1336
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:51,920
if we need be you know one thing that i

1337
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:53,760
find remarkable is that

1338
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,960
things have this kind of moment when

1339
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,640
everyone was talking about contact

1340
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:57,599
tracing and everyone was really focused

1341
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:59,920
on it and

1342
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:02,160
you know now that the pandemic is really

1343
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:04,079
overridden the entire country with kind

1344
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,000
of these kind of hot spots in

1345
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:07,200
the major states like in texas in

1346
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,160
california

1347
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:11,680
florida i know that the work is still

1348
00:46:10,160 --> 00:46:14,078
ongoing i get reports

1349
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:15,279
episodically but it's just i don't know

1350
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,560
if the tech world is just

1351
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,920
throwing its hands up in the air and

1352
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,560
said that we can't make this work

1353
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,520
because

1354
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:22,319
this response of the pandemic is just so

1355
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:24,240
botched

1356
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:26,079
um be interesting to get your

1357
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,520
perspectives on it i know i've seen

1358
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:28,079
reports on how it's working in other

1359
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,000
countries

1360
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:32,079
and both the kind of the challenges that

1361
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:35,520
rashida raised in terms of

1362
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,280
uh both the faults uh reports

1363
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:42,079
maybe uh driving people underground

1364
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,640
and and creating i think stigma is a

1365
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:47,280
very big issue that i remember trying to

1366
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,960
kind of uh kind of advocate that just

1367
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:50,480
because you think this disease can

1368
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:52,800
affect everyone equally not everyone's

1369
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:53,680
going to feel the impact of this disease

1370
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,400
equally so i think we

1371
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:59,040
continue to need to be very discerning

1372
00:46:56,400 --> 00:47:01,200
and asking the hard questions about it

1373
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:03,040
i also think that that the idea that

1374
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,839
it's a little bit of techno-optimism

1375
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,759
that here we are

1376
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:07,520
battling this major new pandemic and

1377
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:10,319
this new virus that no one's

1378
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,359
known before and all of a sudden the

1379
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:15,200
titans of tech

1380
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:17,759
can rush to the kind of rescue was

1381
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:19,680
you know a bit of the the hubris of tech

1382
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:20,960
if you forgive the criticism i don't

1383
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:21,440
mean that for any of the people in this

1384
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:23,200
room

1385
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:24,880
usually people in this room are people

1386
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:28,160
who try to wield tech for good

1387
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,359
um for us kovit has at least four major

1388
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,520
fronts in addition to the privacy uh

1389
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:35,520
kind of issues i just mentioned is one

1390
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:37,119
to deal with the communities that uh

1391
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,640
that don't have the ability to do what

1392
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,960
i'm doing i've been locked in my dining

1393
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,520
room table here i was mentioning to you

1394
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,960
uh since mid-march turned off the clock

1395
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,960
behind me because i couldn't stand the

1396
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:48,880
ticking of the pendulum anymore

1397
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:50,800
i've been able to socially distance and

1398
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,359
wash my hands and wear a mask

1399
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:55,680
that's not true for 2.2 million people

1400
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:59,200
who are incarcerated in the u.s

1401
00:47:55,680 --> 00:48:00,879
so over 120 of our lawsuits have been

1402
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,960
focused on getting

1403
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:04,960
medically vulnerable people who were in

1404
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:06,640
prisons and jails

1405
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:08,960
and immigration detention centers

1406
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:10,879
getting them out and trying to do it

1407
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,400
through advocacy but also through

1408
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:13,920
litigation and the conditions of

1409
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:16,880
confinement

1410
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:17,440
some of this is enough to make you kind

1411
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,480
of

1412
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,480
you know cry is the only human reaction

1413
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:25,359
you can have i mean the conditions

1414
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:27,359
of confinement the way in which you know

1415
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:30,799
80 percent of a particular prison

1416
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:34,400
can now test positive for covid where

1417
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:35,599
kind of the the inmates were subjected

1418
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,000
to poor

1419
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,440
conditions before a pandemic and now

1420
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,319
especially with

1421
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:43,280
kind of guards and family members who

1422
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,079
are

1423
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:47,839
not able or reluctant to come and and do

1424
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,680
the work in the prisons ourselves that

1425
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:53,200
there's greater isolation

1426
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:55,118
and the judges are are reluctant

1427
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:57,118
to let people out because especially as

1428
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:00,000
this president brandishes

1429
00:48:57,119 --> 00:49:01,599
a law and order agenda as a way to kind

1430
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:04,800
of run for re-election

1431
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:06,240
judges are more unlikely to

1432
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,839
jump into that and so it's been very

1433
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:09,439
frustrating i think america has

1434
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:12,000
fundamentally failed i look at what's

1435
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,960
played out in countries like italy

1436
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,040
where they have decreased their prison

1437
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:19,440
population by more than 10 percent

1438
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:20,079
in other nations of the world in egypt

1439
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:23,520
even

1440
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:25,440
iran uh much more have been leaders of

1441
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:26,720
human rights when it comes to coveting

1442
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,480
the jails and prisons

1443
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,240
second front for us has been around

1444
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,800
keeping some of the

1445
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:34,078
controversial medical services available

1446
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:36,720
in the pandemic

1447
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:38,000
abortion services who would have guessed

1448
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,520
i didn't see it coming but you know

1449
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:41,440
there are ideologues who use the

1450
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:43,599
pandemic as a way to close down abortion

1451
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,000
clinics there are other ideologues who

1452
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:45,359
said we

1453
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,720
won't give you we won't give you access

1454
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:48,000
to an abortion or termination of a

1455
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,319
pregnancy unless

1456
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:52,720
you can get a covet test making it

1457
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:54,240
impossible for women to exercise their

1458
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:56,558
constitutional rights

1459
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,520
uh making it a requirement for women to

1460
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:02,800
go into a doctor's office to pick up

1461
00:49:59,520 --> 00:50:03,440
uh the the medical abortion medication

1462
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,839
that they could

1463
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:06,640
uh use to terminate pregnancy all of

1464
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:09,680
that over

1465
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,240
over a dozen cases then there's been the

1466
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:13,680
the the efforts to kind of ensure that

1467
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:15,040
people can vote

1468
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,720
especially we have a november election

1469
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,599
coming up that our president wants to

1470
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:19,040
postpone or

1471
00:50:17,599 --> 00:50:20,640
hints at postponing but doesn't have the

1472
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:22,000
power to postpone but

1473
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:23,598
doing it in such a way to try to

1474
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,960
suppress the vote among some

1475
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:26,240
constituents that he

1476
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,640
doesn't believe are going to vote for

1477
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,160
him and for a lot of folks who don't

1478
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:33,359
want to line up

1479
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:35,118
on on a queue or don't want to interface

1480
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:37,200
with a computer because touching a

1481
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,960
computer screen might make them at risk

1482
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,399
for a pandemic the best thing to do is

1483
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:43,520
allow people to vote

1484
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:46,079
at home vote by mail some of our states

1485
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:46,880
like washington state already have great

1486
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,839
systems

1487
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:51,200
our own president votes by mail even

1488
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:53,119
when he criticizes

1489
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,598
the vote by mail procedure so we've been

1490
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,800
litigating in more than 15 states

1491
00:50:55,599 --> 00:51:01,920
to for to force the states to adopt

1492
00:50:58,800 --> 00:51:04,960
covid friendly voting practices

1493
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:07,359
and it's uh we have 155

1494
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,559
covid related lawsuits all in since

1495
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:10,400
mid-march

1496
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,400
and i think it's really important for us

1497
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,400
to keep the pressure on because

1498
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,400
for like just like rashida said it's

1499
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:18,400
it's certain communities it's the black

1500
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:21,520
and latino and low-income

1501
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:23,359
communities the elderly uh communities

1502
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,960
in nursing homes that have been mostly

1503
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,799
affected by this pandemic

1504
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,480
and we've got to keep a real focus on

1505
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:31,599
those particular communities because

1506
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:31,599
they are most at risk

1507
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:38,799
anthony thank you for that and thanks to

1508
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:41,760
i will just take a moment to thank

1509
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,319
your team actually who um across all of

1510
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:44,880
the different

1511
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,558
um civil liberty unions by state and

1512
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:49,599
national that are working

1513
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,520
day and night to use the the courts uh

1514
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,720
and other mechanisms in order to protect

1515
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,440
american rights i mean

1516
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:57,520
i've been living in the u.s for uh 12

1517
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,079
years you know just before obama came in

1518
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:00,960
and then and they've seen you know this

1519
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:03,040
sort of

1520
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:04,480
roll out of the aclu's work across

1521
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,839
presidents actually which has been

1522
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:07,359
really really impressive

1523
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,040
obviously a lot of work to do a lot of

1524
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:10,720
internal reflection as well how to make

1525
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:11,520
the organization better and stronger and

1526
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,240
more

1527
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,839
um reactive and responsive to you know

1528
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:19,279
issues from race to

1529
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:21,839
to you know sort of technology um

1530
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:22,319
but thanks a lot to your team and and

1531
00:52:21,839 --> 00:52:24,400
for

1532
00:52:22,319 --> 00:52:26,240
you know being great partners for access

1533
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,400
now as an organization as well

1534
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,160
let me ask you both in the remaining

1535
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:34,640
minutes of rashida to you

1536
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,319
um can you give us uh

1537
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:38,000
just looking forward and i know that

1538
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:39,680
we're so struggling with the moment

1539
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:42,319
right now but i'd love to hear

1540
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:44,078
like what you think the next achievable

1541
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:45,759
perhaps winnable battle might be

1542
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:47,760
or even if it's not achievable winnable

1543
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:50,400
like where you think the focus

1544
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:54,400
of the movement should be in the us

1545
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,400
going forward let's let's look at 2021

1546
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,839
um i

1547
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:16,000
actually no okay here i think we

1548
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:17,280
need to not be distracted and actually

1549
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:20,559
keep sustain

1550
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:22,880
this sort of level of public outrage and

1551
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:23,839
what i see as more cohesion that's

1552
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:26,480
happening now

1553
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:28,319
to actually move for more systemic and

1554
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,280
structural change so that way we can

1555
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:31,119
sort of do

1556
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:32,559
what both anthony and i have referred to

1557
00:53:31,119 --> 00:53:34,160
of like this more proactive and

1558
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:36,000
imaginative thinking of

1559
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,598
what is the theory of change of creating

1560
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,440
a more inclusive society

1561
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:41,280
and i don't think you can wake up and do

1562
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:43,040
that tomorrow because there's a lot of

1563
00:53:41,280 --> 00:53:43,599
structural barriers we need to break

1564
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,440
down

1565
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:47,760
so i think it's trying to do that

1566
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,119
systemic analysis and figure out

1567
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:54,000
what are the biggest barriers to equity

1568
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:55,680
especially racial equity and how can we

1569
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,280
take those down as quickly as possible

1570
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:59,919
but at the same time

1571
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,000
trying to envision what is that

1572
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,079
alternative vision of a society that we

1573
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,760
need to start working towards creating

1574
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:08,000
and what are the conversations we can

1575
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:11,839
start having now on like an individual

1576
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,839
level to help us get there

1577
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,000
because i think the thing is and over to

1578
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,520
you anthony and we might run a minute or

1579
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:21,280
two late which is fine

1580
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:24,480
um but listen i mean you know president

1581
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,559
biden uh in place

1582
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:28,160
and and and so what does that mean in

1583
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:30,480
terms of

1584
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,200
the what does it mean for you because as

1585
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,520
i said like i've seen the aclu and other

1586
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,640
you know like you had to deal with

1587
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,880
guantanamo bay

1588
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,879
under

1589
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,520
i'm sure you do i'm sure you do and i at

1590
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:50,319
the point being is that like things

1591
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,720
you know if if the polls of riot and and

1592
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,920
and

1593
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,720
trump you know it does go down um

1594
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,680
what does it mean for the us give me two

1595
00:54:56,720 --> 00:54:59,200
scenarios and i'm sure you're doing a

1596
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,040
lot of scenario planning there as you

1597
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:04,480
did in the previous election like

1598
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:04,480
what does it look like under biden

1599
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:10,000
i you know i think first i appreciate

1600
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:11,440
rasheeda's point that we need to just

1601
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,880
even the comments she made under her

1602
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,240
breath we just needed to make it through

1603
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,400
november that's very much

1604
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:18,000
i'm with you my girl i love you for

1605
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,280
saying that because i sometimes wonder

1606
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:21,119
whether i can make it

1607
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,200
through november i eat my wheaties and i

1608
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:25,280
wake up and i sleep well but

1609
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:27,359
it's a frothy challenging time and we

1610
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,040
need to i'll make it through november

1611
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,480
and i and i would like to think look i'm

1612
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,319
i have to be an optimist because

1613
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,000
otherwise this is this would be a killer

1614
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:37,119
job it's hard to kind of face what's

1615
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,480
going on and

1616
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,960
across all these issues in different

1617
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,559
locations i it's not a job for a

1618
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,359
pessimist or a cynic it's just

1619
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,040
you know go to the private sector you've

1620
00:55:45,359 --> 00:55:49,040
got to have you got to be idealistic and

1621
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:51,759
optimistic you can't be naive

1622
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:52,079
but we need we need clear-eyed optimists

1623
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:54,240
uh

1624
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:55,119
in these jobs otherwise nothing will get

1625
00:55:54,240 --> 00:55:58,240
done

1626
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:59,680
uh i i've got to think i've got to

1627
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:02,879
believe

1628
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:06,000
that as imperfect as biden is and

1629
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,880
he's imperfect and i've got to believe

1630
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,480
that the

1631
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:12,160
the moment will make the president

1632
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,400
and i've got to believe that the country

1633
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:17,839
that comes out of

1634
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:20,960
this pandemic and this recession

1635
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:23,119
the country that comes out of uh donald

1636
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:25,920
trump's four years of running amok

1637
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:27,520
over our norms and rules and laws the

1638
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,480
country that comes out of

1639
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:31,040
this the techno optimist bubble being

1640
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,520
burst

1641
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:35,359
and now greater questions being raised

1642
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:37,440
of these social media giants like

1643
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:39,040
facebook and twitter and whatnot

1644
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:41,839
i've got to believe that the country

1645
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:44,319
coming out of these crises

1646
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:46,000
uh in the world actually the the the

1647
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:47,359
society has got to be better than the

1648
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,640
one that went into it

1649
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:53,839
and i think biden will have to be

1650
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:55,279
fully boxed into a corner right that

1651
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:56,480
there is going to be nothing we're going

1652
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:58,480
to get they're playing a very

1653
00:56:56,480 --> 00:57:01,839
conservative election

1654
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:02,799
and if if that's any indication then

1655
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:04,960
he's going to play it very

1656
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,599
conservatively in the first

1657
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:09,839
couple of months of his presidency and

1658
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:10,839
this is not a time for conservatism this

1659
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:14,880
is a time for

1660
00:57:10,839 --> 00:57:16,480
boldness for vision for audacity

1661
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:17,839
and the the place where i've been

1662
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:19,119
spending a lot of time in rashida you

1663
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:20,799
and i can talk after we're off this

1664
00:57:19,119 --> 00:57:23,440
panel is i've been spending a bunch of

1665
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,640
time trying to read through

1666
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:29,280
the moments when we made you know

1667
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,319
huge leaps or tried to take huge leaps

1668
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:33,280
forwards

1669
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:33,759
on social issues and what we need is

1670
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:35,839
like a

1671
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,280
third reconstruction right i've been

1672
00:57:35,839 --> 00:57:38,480
thinking a lot about reading a lot about

1673
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:41,359
lbj

1674
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,040
a very unlikely protagonist for racial

1675
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,680
justice and civil rights

1676
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,480
you know but the time it was forced upon

1677
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:48,399
him

1678
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:49,760
and then he had to pick up the mantle

1679
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,440
and kind of play

1680
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,720
the role he played with the civil rights

1681
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,079
act and the voting rights act and the

1682
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,879
fair housing act

1683
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,000
we need the kind of ambition of a third

1684
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,119
reconstruction

1685
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,319
on social policy in the u.s that really

1686
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,079
speaks to

1687
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:06,240
the adversity and the challenges of the

1688
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:08,160
moment because a little bit of fix here

1689
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,879
and a little bit of fix there

1690
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,839
the laundry list of what is broken under

1691
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:14,559
trump

1692
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:16,000
is is long and they have to get fixed

1693
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,760
they can't just

1694
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,000
pretend that it's all going to go away

1695
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,359
but you need a boldness of vision

1696
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,200
that that's going to come and that's

1697
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:24,558
going to be infused in the highest

1698
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:26,319
levels of our government

1699
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:28,160
if it's come if it comes from us and

1700
00:58:26,319 --> 00:58:30,880
it's demanded from us

1701
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,799
so that's that's how i stay optimistic

1702
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,799
and energetic

1703
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:36,240
i mean that's you know to be able to

1704
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:37,119
have come through all of this and you

1705
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:39,279
and your team and

1706
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:40,720
many you know unsung heroes that are

1707
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:42,480
working on the front lines

1708
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:44,078
uh a lot of people to come with that

1709
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,839
same sense of

1710
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:47,680
yeah a lot of people's that sense of

1711
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,440
optimism that there's a possibility and

1712
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:51,118
i think that

1713
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:52,880
it's not just and this conversation is

1714
00:58:51,119 --> 00:58:53,280
obviously focused on the us because of

1715
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:55,760
the

1716
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,559
the interviewees or the participants on

1717
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:58,880
the call you too

1718
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,680
but actually there's multiple

1719
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:02,720
discussions

1720
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,480
in multiple jurisdictions about

1721
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:06,399
how do we get through this period and

1722
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,799
how does what we call

1723
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,040
you know shrinking civic space and how

1724
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:12,240
do we actually grow civic space now how

1725
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:14,160
do we actually

1726
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,319
uh wow look at that cyborg that i've

1727
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,240
become um how do we how do we

1728
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:19,680
how do we grow civic space and how do we

1729
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:23,520
actually empower

1730
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:25,759
us to um force our leaders

1731
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:27,680
to actually come up with and implement

1732
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:28,640
the bold vision that we as citizens want

1733
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,879
from them

1734
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,400
um so with that i'm going to close us

1735
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:34,400
down because we're over time

1736
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,920

00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:44,879
practical approach to finding solutions

1741
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:47,839
for us so thank you very much
