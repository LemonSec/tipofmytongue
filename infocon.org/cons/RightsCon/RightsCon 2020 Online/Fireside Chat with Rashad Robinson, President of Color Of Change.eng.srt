00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,039
hi everybody my name is natalian conde

2
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
and i am joining you from new york city

3
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,159
in the united states and it's my

4
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,200
pleasure

5
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,280
this morning to be part of this fireside

6
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,159
chat with rashad robinson

7
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,200
president of color of change i am the

8
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:06,159
founding ceo

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,080
of a non-profit called ai for the people

10
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,640
and our mission is to increase

11
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,800
the representation of black

12
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:14,640
technologists within the public interest

13
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,440
sector by 2030

14
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,319
and we do that through a variety of ways

15
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
including

16
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,238
high-level consultations we work with

17
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,680
journalists

18
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,840
and filmmakers and other creative

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
professionals to really advance this

20
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,200
idea

21
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,400
that tech is not neutral and in actual

22
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,000
fact tech is

23
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:39,840
in many cases anti-black so without

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,440
further ado it is my absolute pleasure

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,360
to welcome rashad and um

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,040
really kick us after what i think what i

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
hope is going to be

28
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,879
an inspiring and as much as we can make

29
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,359
it fun conversation

30
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,160
but one that really looks at technology

31
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,040
through that

32
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,440
angle so my first my first question to

33
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
you rashad is really about the entry

34
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,120
point

35
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,799
in which you came to this i've

36
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,920
made films about science and technology

37
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,959
since 1998 but it really wasn't

38
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,079
until 2012 when george zimmerman

39
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:15,760
surveilled trayvon martin that

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,000
i began to become interested in

41
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,239
technology and that's because

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,720
in my prior life as a documentary

43
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,200
filmmaker i had read about reports

44
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,319
of facial recognition tests like the one

45
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,000
in 2002

46
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,920
for the super bowl and really quite

47
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,760
frankly thought it was nonsense

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
really thought you know this would never

49
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,120
happen this is science fiction and it

50
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,319
wasn't until

51
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:38,879
i really leaned into uh the coding

52
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,920
movement

53
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,920
as a parent i have two young boys um

54
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,679
that i and then i started to work

55
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,079
opposite google that i realized that

56
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,560
this

57
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,720
might impact them in a negative way

58
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,720
could you let us know a little bit

59
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,720
about how color of change first of all

60
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:56,640
started i think that's really interested

61
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,439
but how you got to this tech

62
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:00,958
accountability

63
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
so great first of all it's great to be

64
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,799
with you it's great to be with all of

65
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,399
you

66
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:09,200
um at um rights khani sad that we can't

67
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:11,840
be together but in so many ways the

68
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,879
um crisis that we are in the middle of

69
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,000
um which has

70
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,120
in so many ways exposed all um

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,358
different aspects of systemic racism

72
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,960
you know has allowed me to go to a lot

73
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,080
more places and i would have to go

74
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
otherwise if i

75
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,919
had to get on a plane and so i'm joining

76
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,719
you from uh eastern long island right

77
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,039
now

78
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,040
um and um and want to talk a little bit

79
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
about color of change and how we found

80
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,759
it and sort of

81
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,919
respond to the tourists kind of respond

82
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
to the question around our founding is

83
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,280
you know we were founded in the

84
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,479
aftermath of a flood uh which was

85
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,679
hurricane katrina

86
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,919
about 15 years ago now uh it was

87
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:50,240
started by bad decision makers and

88
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,880
turned into a life-altering disaster

89
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
by bad decision makers black people were

90
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,560
on their roofs begging for the

91
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,440
government to do something

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
and they were left to die and um the

93
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,120
thing that's important i think about

94
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,120
katrina that gets to sort of how we

95
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,120
uh think about our theory of change

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,199
across all sectors of our work but also

97
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,360
how we think about technology

98
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:15,440
is that um at the end of the day like

99
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,479
katrina illustrated things that people

100
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,560
already knew

101
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,560
geographic segregation generational

102
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,919
poverty the impacts of what we've done

103
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,919
to our planet the ways in which

104
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,799
structural racism undergirds all of

105
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,359
those things

106
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,080
and at the heart of katrina no one was

107
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,240
nervous

108
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,479
about disappointing black people and

109
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,560
when institutions are not nervous

110
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,159
about disappointing your community it

111
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,280
doesn't matter what kind of research

112
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:39,440
report you have that

113
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,039
illustrates all the facts and figures it

114
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,479
doesn't matter what you do in the courts

115
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
if you don't have the power to implement

116
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,400
it

117
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,400
it doesn't matter what you build in

118
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,719
silicon valley because you can't

119
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,520
sort of code your way out of systemic

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
racism

121
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,080
and so part of the sort of theory of

122
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,759
change of color of change was how do we

123
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,800
channel the presence that black people

124
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,800
have in the world

125
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,960
the visibility the awareness into the

126
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,960
power to actually change the rules

127
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,239
to force those in power to be nervous

128
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,318
about disappointing us

129
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,680
and that goes across silicon valley

130
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:10,319
hollywood wall street

131
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,039
capitol hills both in states and

132
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:13,600
federally

133
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,440
and so many other sort of aspects of

134
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,800
life that impacts black people and

135
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,880
aspects of power

136
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:20,720
and so you know from the very beginning

137
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:22,560
as an e as an organization that started

138
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,199
with a single email to about a thousand

139
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,600
people

140
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,720
and inviting them to join this movement

141
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,840
we very much

142
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,319
have um sort of relied on and believed

143
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,560
in the power of an open internet and

144
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,039
fought very hard around net neutrality

145
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:39,280
to protect it not just sort of as a

146
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,280
sort of theoretical human rights issue

147
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,679
not as an actual practical human rights

148
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,840
issue

149
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,759
but as a civil rights issue with a very

150
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,679
specific context here

151
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:49,440
in the united states about the ability

152
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:51,680
of people to be heard counted

153
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
and visible regardless of whether

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
they're privileged or vulnerable

155
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,919
majority a minority or in favor or out

156
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
of favor with those who are in power but

157
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,639
we got to sort of this technology work

158
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,680
this work around

159
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,800
policing surveillance tech

160
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,880
from the very early pieces because we've

161
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,000
always had a real focus on corporate

162
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,039
accountability

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:17,039
on um sort of the ability to be free um

164
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,360
inside of a democracy ability to be

165
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:21,039
treated equal and so whether it was

166
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,440
dealing with issues of things like

167
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,840
stingrays that were put out

168
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,960
side of protest which were capturing

169
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:30,479
sort of unlawfully

170
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,880
all sorts of um sort of uh conversations

171
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,000
and

172
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:37,039
um and uh surveilling um uh

173
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,720
movements of black activists um to

174
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,639
sort of the ways in which we were being

175
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,560
doxed on platforms and not

176
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,560
um and those platforms not being held

177
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,960
accountable to facial recognition

178
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,240
at each phase these sort of issues sit

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,080
at the intersection

180
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,080
of sort of our rights inside of a

181
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,840
democracy corporate power and the

182
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,719
relationship to corporations

183
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,758
and sort of um the sort of day-to-day

184
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:59,440
sort of rules

185
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,960
whether they be policy or whether they

186
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,039
be unwritten rules that

187
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,198
impact black people's lives and so

188
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,599
technology has been a through line and a

189
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,400
real

190
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,479
through line from the very beginning

191
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
which was hurricane katrina which in so

192
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,240
many ways

193
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,680
animated all of the ways in which like

194
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:18,639
disinvestment

195
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,560
targeting exploitation of black people

196
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,039
sort of puts us in harm's way

197
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,000
and out of that building a powerful

198
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,159
infrastructure

199
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,440
that could hold those who made those

200
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,000
decisions accountable

201
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:33,039
and create a new set of rules um for how

202
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,039
they have to do business

203
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,680
all of that i agree with all of that and

204
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,800
where i would really like to start this

205
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,519
conversation

206
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:45,120
is not with advanced technological

207
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,000
systems even though i would like us to

208
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,320
get there

209
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,480
later on in the context of policing but

210
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,680
more about this idea that there were a

211
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,399
thousand people

212
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,519
that you sent this email and you somehow

213
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,839
had to capture

214
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,240
that imagination i remember working at

215
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,880
the bbc in 2005

216
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,760
and seeing those uh pictures and really

217
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,439
wondering

218
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,439
you know what was wrong with the united

219
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,080
states i think people from outside of

220
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,320
the states

221
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,000
think anti-black racism is something

222
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
that's unique to this country and of

223
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,480
course

224
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
we know being at writescom that that's

225
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:19,120
really not the case

226
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,240
so where i want to get to is some of the

227
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,640
strategies that

228
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,279
the color of change have used in

229
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,560
policing

230
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,519
specifically to capture our imagination

231
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,239
around policing and how we're using

232
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,600
media

233
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:35,760
and popular culture to change our views

234
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,959
um of policing and then kind of lead

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,560
into more of

236
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,880
more specifically about your work in

237
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:42,800
that area

238
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,399
so yeah i mean we do a lot of work in

239
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,800
hollywood and you know

240
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,839
one reason why that is so important is

241
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,240
because the cultural images and the

242
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,399
stories

243
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,080
end up shaping the reality that people

244
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,240
have about the system and so

245
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,320
for the last 20 years in this country

246
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,360
violent crime has basically steadily

247
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,360
went down

248
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,959
basically steadily went down according

249
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,760
to pew research and others

250
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,160
americans believe violent crime is going

251
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,240
up

252
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,199
and so we have a gap between perception

253
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:12,160
and reality

254
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:13,600
that is deeply fueled by a whole set of

255
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,480
incentive structures that happen

256
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,399
on our sort of corporate media airways

257
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,519
we recently published a report in

258
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,160
january

259
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,200
um called normalizing injustice which

260
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,600
looked at the

261
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:27,360
crime procedural the crime tv shows the

262
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,560
scripted shows like law and order and

263
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
csi and others

264
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,319
and sort of their representation of race

265
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:34,320
and their representation of crime

266
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,560
as it related to sort of the sort of

267
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,560
role of technology these shows do

268
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,959
actually a tremendous disservice

269
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,760
day in and day out of normalizing the

270
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,880
type of illegal

271
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:46,079
unconstitutional surveillance almost

272
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,480
creating a world where the

273
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,199
ins justify the means that they're going

274
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,800
to violate

275
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,120
someone's first amendment rights but

276
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,160
they caught the bad guy and so everyone

277
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,320
um was kept safe these shows are

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,800
are supported sort of on the back end by

279
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:04,399
all sorts of sort of law enforcement and

280
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:06,479
uh intelligence um experts who

281
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,760
end up being paid consultants on these

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,480
shows um

283
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:11,920
these shows then reach millions upon

284
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,399
millions of people so right

285
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,560
undoing the kind of day in day out

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,120
context of these shows with an op-ed

287
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,839
piece

288
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,399
or a documentary is almost untenable

289
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,240
because

290
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,600
what we've done is we've created a world

291
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,959
in which um people

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:29,839
see privacy uh fundamentals

293
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,319
of our sort of data security and our

294
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,200
sort of

295
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,240
um our kind of daily movements being

296
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,760
violated

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:40,640
um but they see it it dramatized in ways

298
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,480
up against a sort of threat that makes

299
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,319
it seem like it's okay

300
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,000
to violate those rights because their

301
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,640
people are being kept safe and then

302
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,640
maybe

303
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,560
the rights that are there are kind of

304
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,000
sort of inconvenient

305
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:56,880
to the sort of larger threat of of

306
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,600
violence from a sort of black or brown

307
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,399
or sort of

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,560
foreign force um and we can throw our

309
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:04,800
constitution out the window

310
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,119
and part of what we've been doing is

311
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,519
working to push back against those shows

312
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,399
working to create sort of a new sort of

313
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:13,760
understanding

314
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,920
a new sort of uh um uh kind of

315
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,439
system of how about how these shows tell

316
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,920
stories

317
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,519
and so now that we're in this where you

318
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:23,680
know we're in this mess so

319
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,519
for example until i read your report i

320
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,519
would have said one of my favorite

321
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:30,240
shows was law order svu or suv i don't i

322
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:33,519
don't know

323
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,000
but then ultimately you know ultimately

324
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,360
i'm thinking this is actually a terrible

325
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,440
show that is

326
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,720
that is about sexual crime and maybe i

327
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,959
need a therapist

328
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,000
maybe i need to examine myself but what

329
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:47,119
the reason i'm so

330
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:47,519
interested in that is in this moment

331
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:50,639
where

332
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,000
policing for the first time at least

333
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,959
in in my lifetime which is relatively

334
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,440
short because

335
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,479
black people in the united states have

336
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,600
fought against

337
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:04,560
casserole control since you know

338
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,839
for 401 years the when africans came to

339
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,560
this country and were enslaved they

340
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,120
resisted

341
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,560
and thereon that's the history on which

342
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,360
that advocacy is built

343
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:14,319
but i'm really curious that as color of

344
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:17,680
change was

345
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,440
getting involved with conversations

346
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:21,920
about defunding the police and

347
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,519
conversations about reimagining

348
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,560
the way that we think about public

349
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:29,519
safety uh in response to

350
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:30,959
the ex-judicial killing of george floyd

351
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,600
and of course

352
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:35,760
since george floyd aubry has died and

353
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,959
even prior just prior to george floyd

354
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,199
brianna taylor

355
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,638
an african-american woman had been

356
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,599
killed in her own home

357
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,480
where the police went in like a cop

358
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,440
style

359
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:47,760
raid it looked like t it sounded like tv

360
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,360
and

361
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,120
assassinated this woman and we're still

362
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,279
waiting for justice on that

363
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,480
but i'm wondering as color of change is

364
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,720
doing some of this work

365
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,600
around changing the way we think about

366
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,600
police and

367
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,199
changing the way we think about a

368
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:04,079
technological

369
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:06,079
police form how did these images inform

370
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,199
and what strategies did you guys

371
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
use to bring us back to the reality that

372
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,439
crime is falling and we have fundamental

373
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:15,599
rights that need to be protected

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:18,079
even if they're being abused by agents

375
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,920
of the state

376
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:21,920
well i think it's actually really

377
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,599
important that we redefine

378
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,439
what policing is because i think that

379
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:28,480
we've gotten this idea that

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:30,160
uh where there is police there is safety

381
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,440
and that's actually not the case i mean

382
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:36,240
if if the presence of a lot of policemen

383
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:38,160
a lot of safety like folks would spend

384
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:39,360
all their time feeling deeply safe in

385
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
some of the poorest

386
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,560
most challenged communities where there

387
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,120
are a lot of police

388
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,959
uh what ends up happening is is that we

389
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:48,639
substitute police

390
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:50,319
in certain communities particularly

391
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,279
black and brown communities for the

392
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,160
things that we know

393
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:56,000
actually make communities whole which is

394
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,160
investment in economics

395
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:00,079
investment in schools investment health

396
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,639
care investment and the things that make

397
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:04,160
communities fully safe you know where

398
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,240
there are a lot of police there ends up

399
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:08,719
being a lot of police violence and much

400
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,880
like the conversation around guns

401
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,079
i don't believe that we can actually

402
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:14,320
deal with gun violence

403
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,920
with just a bunch of impotent gun laws

404
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,240
we actually have to

405
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:19,920
remove guns we have to downsize the

406
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,040
number of guns and so unless we are

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,199
downsizing

408
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,120
the number of police and actually

409
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,120
right-sizing the investments in

410
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,519
communities we're not going to get to a

411
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,160
new

412
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,040
sense of safety and justice in our

413
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,279
communities

414
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,160
and i think that that um sort of how is

415
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,800
how i really think about it you know

416
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:40,560
this is sort of not just about how do we

417
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,000
make the system work better i hear

418
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,239
people say that on ai

419
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
i hear people say that about policing if

420
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,720
we can just do better training

421
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,440
we can sort of make things sort of

422
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,199
better but

423
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,839
you know here's the thing when i was in

424
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,719
the final phases back in 2013 of getting

425
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:58,240
fox

426
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:01,279
tv network to cancel the tv show cops

427
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,920
it was a bit you know 21st century fox a

428
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,120
big

429
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,759
corporation with a sort of um infamous

430
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:07,759
leader

431
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,959
and you know talking to their pr folks

432
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,320
and their other folks who were going

433
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,839
back and forth with us

434
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,759
we had kind of had them on the ropes

435
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:17,440
around the campaign and they offered

436
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,320
to diversify the sort of uh communities

437
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,320
they went in

438
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,600
and basically that was sort of code for

439
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,440
we won't go into

440
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:25,120
as many black communities we'll go into

441
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,959
poor white communities because they

442
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:28,079
um and i told them i was like if you're

443
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,518
saying that you're going to go into more

444
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,880
poor white communities and that's going

445
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,440
to make us feel better than you've

446
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,600
picked

447
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:35,279
the wrong racial justice organization

448
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:38,480
because unless you're going to film

449
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,040
the tv show cops on capitol hill or wall

450
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,279
street

451
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,880
where actual crime happens at a deep

452
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,519
structural level that we know hurts

453
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:45,360
people

454
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:47,199
in deep ways and i'm not interested in

455
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,639
you continuing to go into communities

456
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:50,639
that are already under attack

457
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,759
that are already targeted and so what i

458
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:54,079
say about sort of

459
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:55,279
all of this right work is is that

460
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,839
corporate power

461
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,759
um that does that the sort of history of

462
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,320
policing to protect corporations to

463
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,880
protect

464
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:04,000
property to um you know protect the

465
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,319
slave trade

466
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,000
all the way up to now sort of in a

467
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,480
corporate democracy

468
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,039
um sort of the relationship between

469
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:13,280
police

470
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,400
and safety is one that i think we have

471
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,959
to integrate

472
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,640
because police are not there to keep us

473
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:22,079
safe police are here to keep

474
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,600
control and where um that is the case we

475
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:26,000
can't just simply put

476
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,280
laws around less choke holes because if

477
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,799
the someone's

478
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:30,720
goal is to control you then they're

479
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,760
gonna find another way to control you

480
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:35,520
if you um if you ban chokeholds and so

481
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:38,080
that's how we got the defund

482
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,639
and that is how it is always connected

483
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:41,039
with

484
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,720
technology as we see our police become

485
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,200
militarized as we see them

486
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
um operating in some ways like they are

487
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,480
sort of dealing

488
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,240
with sort of foreign forces because

489
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,240
that's how black people are oftentimes

490
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:55,200
treated in our communities as

491
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:55,919
enemy combatants and so part of this is

492
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,080
really

493
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:59,200
reshaping the resources that law

494
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:01,280
enforcement has

495
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:04,080
in right-sizing our vision around what

496
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:07,120
safety looks like for all of us

497
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,240
and so just just on the back end of that

498
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:12,639
um obviously i'm i'm a

499
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,000
technologist i'm a nerd i'm a geek i'm

500
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,640
really interested

501
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,280
in from your perspective from like a

502
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:20,400
rights

503
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:22,799
organization how have you seen

504
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,080
technology being increasing the change

505
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,360
the changes

506
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,918
in technology i'm sorry

507
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,879
the changes in technology in terms of

508
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:32,880
the campaigns

509
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:35,600
that you've done so i opened this

510
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:37,600
conversation saying my entry point

511
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,879
um into this work was through this

512
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:41,280
vigilante killing

513
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:42,400
right but this was a person surveilling

514
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:45,039
a person

515
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,280
but as a professional i did know that

516
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:50,400
facial recognition was being used i

517
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:52,320
i always say i thought it was a joke

518
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,520
i thought technology was great i thought

519
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,559
that if we had an app

520
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,879
we would be able to to um

521
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,799
you know we would be able to diversify

522
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,360
the data set or or you know somehow

523
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:05,840
solve racism and through a push

524
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,080
notification but clearly i was wrong

525
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,199
and one of the things that i'm really

526
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,918
interested in

527
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,200
is as you've had to advocate for these

528
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,000
different campaigns

529
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,880
in terms of police how have your tactics

530
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,240
had to change

531
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:22,320
to uh respond to the new technology

532
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:25,360
because there probably wasn't a stingray

533
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:29,200
right in 2005 with katrina

534
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,520
um sorry i'm fascinated about that

535
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:33,200
so you know i mean this is really one of

536
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,000
the biggest challenges of constantly

537
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:37,520
trying to keep

538
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,360
up um inside of uh a marketplace where

539
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:42,480
the incentives to

540
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,520
uh fast-track new policies fast-track

541
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,720
new products

542
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:49,679
um is so um is so deep

543
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,640
uh racism is like water pouring over the

544
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,360
floor

545
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:54,480
with that has holes in it it will always

546
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:57,360
find the cracks

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:59,919
it will always leak through and so part

548
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,000
of how i've tried to approach this

549
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,520
is while we have to deal with a lot of

550
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,520
one-offs day-to-day

551
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,360
with various companies while we have to

552
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,440
deal with one-offs

553
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:10,639
with different municipalities as things

554
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,000
are implemented

555
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:16,880
if we don't get strong federal standards

556
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:18,400
um around sort of what um how these

557
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,360
companies are related

558
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,200
relating to uh technology and policing

559
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,799
then we're just gonna continue to play

560
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,080
be in this game of whack-a-mole that

561
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
game at the carnival where something

562
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:28,320
pops up and you hit it down and

563
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,600
something else pops up

564
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,120
and while you're hitting that thing

565
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,158
that's popped up five other things have

566
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,080
popped up and so

567
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:36,159
we are actually in a place where i feel

568
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,480
like um in order to

569
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,320
keep up we actually need standards we

570
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,960
need infrastructure in this country that

571
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,158
can

572
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:46,640
um deal with it the hearing today where

573
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,280
um technology ceos are going to capitol

574
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:50,640
hill

575
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,520
um to testify on anti-trust

576
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:54,240
is an is i think a perfect illustration

577
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,000
of

578
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:57,679
sort of all the ways in which so many of

579
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,679
these companies that are at the

580
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:02,000
sort of center of some of the challenges

581
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:05,360
from the sort of social media platform

582
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
like facebook to um amazon and the role

583
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,199
and facial recognition

584
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:11,679
all of these companies that the sort of

585
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,320
incentives around profit and growth

586
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:15,120
um will trample over civil rights

587
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,320
trample over

588
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:21,120
any sort of um sort of beliefs in the

589
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,720
sort of ability of everyday people

590
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,678
regardless of who they are to be

591
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,720
protected

592
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:28,159
um inside of a democracy and so part of

593
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,960
what we have to do is get to new

594
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,600
standards

595
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,360
at the same time we're dealing because

596
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,918
we don't have the political levers right

597
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,158
now

598
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,760
we are dealing with sort of a set of

599
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:40,320
strategies that have to be about

600
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,240
exposing problems when they arise

601
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,000
working to channel corporate power and

602
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,799
hold corporations accountable

603
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,679
working to where we can get rules

604
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:49,360
implemented

605
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,440
working with those who are engaging in

606
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:55,678
the courts all of these things

607
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:59,200
are sort of um um you know

608
00:21:55,679 --> 00:22:02,240
things that we feel comfortable doing um

609
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:04,880
um as long as we are building the

610
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:06,799
the bricks building the house towards

611
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:09,039
the type of long-term change

612
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:10,000
that makes it so that we are not playing

613
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,480
um

614
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,640
we're not we're not chasing various

615
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,559
issues but we're able to make sure that

616
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,000
the systems we put in place are actually

617
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:21,440
enforcing the problems

618
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:22,240
as they arise so um you've just made my

619
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,400
morning

620
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,240
afternoon or evening depending on where

621
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,880
you're where you're watching us from

622
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:29,520
because

623
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:31,039
so much of my work specifically around

624
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:34,960
facial recognition

625
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:37,600
but also around um information integrity

626
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,480
disinformation and misinformation like

627
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:42,000
originates

628
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,960
in the work that i did um in congress

629
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,679
actually as an as an advisor and being

630
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,280
part of that team that introduced the

631
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,559
biometric barriers um act which was the

632
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,559
only one to be

633
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:56,158
in introduced to the u.s house of

634
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,120
representatives during this particular

635
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:59,360
congress

636
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,520
and as well as uh deep fakes

637
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,320
accountability but what we were asking

638
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:05,600
for

639
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:07,360
in all of those bills would this idea

640
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,480
that we have

641
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:12,000
the the the civil not just the civil

642
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:14,000
rights but really the human rights the

643
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,679
constitutional rights that are laid out

644
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,679
to american citizens

645
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:18,720
are applied to these technologies as

646
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,480
well and

647
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,840
one of the things that struck me in your

648
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,640
response was just

649
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:26,480
last week i was on a panel with the un's

650
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,200
special rapporteur for racism

651
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:30,080
tandaya and achimay who was in the

652
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,640
opening

653
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:33,600
ceremonies for rights khan and she's

654
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
just report

655
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,678
she's just released a report called

656
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,080
techno racism

657
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:40,960
and what that did was give a global

658
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,760
perspective

659
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:44,400
of how in many ways we think about the

660
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,200
yuga

661
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,720
and china in terms of facial recognition

662
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,880
and we also think about black

663
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,279
populations and false detection

664
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,400
i'm thinking specifically a case that

665
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,760
the aclu

666
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:59,919
and in michigan currently have where

667
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:01,360
an african-american man was wrongfully

668
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:03,679
arrested

669
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,399
using facial recognition they put his

670
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:07,679
picture

671
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,279
through a camera and misidentified him

672
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:10,000
because they thought all black people

673
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,679
look alike

674
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,440
hopefully all you guys in the audience

675
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,400
can see i me and russia

676
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:18,120
rashad is him and we are separate people

677
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
but he hadn't been at that store since

678
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,199
2014

679
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,760
and and he could prove that that he

680
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:24,880
literally had not been in that place and

681
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:28,000
you know they're going to be able to use

682
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:31,600
geolocation data on his phone to confirm

683
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:34,159
that's a very very long way of me

684
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,639
saying me too i agree with you we do

685
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,159
need

686
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:40,240
standards and i guess leading into my

687
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,640
next question about movements because i

688
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,640
think

689
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:45,200
ai for the people are very very very

690
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,440
concerned about standards and stories

691
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,880
and changing those and then working with

692
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,520
other organizations

693
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,000
that are concerned with movement and

694
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,639
from

695
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:56,720
our vantage point we really credit the

696
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:00,159
movement for black lives

697
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:02,320
for providing a platform by which

698
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:03,200
people could say not just that black

699
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,439
lives matter

700
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,320
but then linking black lives matter to

701
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:11,200
the use of facial recognition and police

702
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:12,559
which ultimately then led to a build

703
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:14,159
that we were able to

704
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:16,799
that we were able to influence because

705
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,600
we had already written the statute

706
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,840
that is an even longer way of me to ask

707
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:24,240
in terms of color of change

708
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,360
that thousand people is now five million

709
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,360
people i believe

710
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,559
i am one of them i look out for your

711
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:31,600
text tell me

712
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,918
yeah seven million people i am one of

713
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,959
them

714
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:36,159
i l i actually look for your texts to

715
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,400
tell me what to do

716
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:39,440
and as soon as um as soon as i'm not

717
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,159
over protecting

718
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,720
my 13 year old i am going to introduce

719
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,080
him to your text so this is generational

720
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:48,720
you know there's this generational

721
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,600
expectation that the way that we

722
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,279
organize

723
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,719
is through through this particular

724
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,320
organization

725
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,919
but how can that seven uh million people

726
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:59,760
who want to do right who want to do

727
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:02,880
right by black people

728
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,720
really be activated in this moment where

729
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,320
we're seeing the movement of black lives

730
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:08,320
being a pressure too

731
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,480
yes i mean a couple of things first you

732
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,520
know we've we are

733
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,600
obviously trying to uh electoralize this

734
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,559
issue as best as possible although it's

735
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,678
complicated

736
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:23,520
we're trying to uh work this into the

737
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,200
ways in which uh political leaders who

738
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,158
are running for office from the very top

739
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,440
of the ticket on

740
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,039
down are sort of including these issues

741
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:33,120
in terms of their platforms and their

742
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:35,120
planks um and then we're also

743
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:36,719
running this campaign called beyond the

744
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,000
statement which we're sort of in the

745
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,640
early phases of

746
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,760
which is really about pushing these big

747
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:44,320
companies across

748
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,200
many sectors from tech companies to

749
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,480
hollywood

750
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:50,320
and elsewhere to move beyond their sort

751
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,520
of hashtag statement of support for

752
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,240
black lives

753
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:55,279
to the sort of structural things that

754
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,360
they will do both

755
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:58,880
internal and then external with their go

756
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,158
to market strategies

757
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,919
to really put some um rigor

758
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,279
and some accountability around

759
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:10,640
statements of support for black lives

760
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:13,200
um that don't coincide with the

761
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,559
uh sort of behavior change or engagement

762
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,600
change of the company

763
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:19,279
and so you know that right for us means

764
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,959
that we actually have to have people in

765
00:27:19,279 --> 00:27:21,760
motion we have to have black folks and

766
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,320
allies

767
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:25,440
of every race with us uh part of our

768
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:28,639
relationship

769
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,120
uh to uh mobilize uh folks

770
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,399
in those moments and if we have sort of

771
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:34,320
those relationships

772
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,439
we can sort of be in a place where we

773
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,918
can build more

774
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,360
more power and more and more engagement

775
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,480
the other thing i will say

776
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,199
um that i think is sort of related to

777
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,039
all of this

778
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,480
is that you know and i kind of touched

779
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:49,039
on a second but i want to like hit a

780
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,799
finer point around it there is this way

781
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,799
especially around ai that i sometimes

782
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,279
hear people think like oh we'll just

783
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:57,918
make the technology better

784
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,720
and if we make the technology better

785
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,840
then we

786
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:03,600
will solve for the problems um and

787
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:05,840
the thing i want to push back on is that

788
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,080
even if we make the technology better

789
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,039
we have to think about how technology is

790
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,000
applied over

791
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,640
imbalances of power right and so even if

792
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,799
you

793
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,480
sort of in certain types of policing

794
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,559
let's say in new york uptown new york

795
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:20,559
where i live i live a stone's throw away

796
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:22,399
from columbia university and a stone's

797
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,320
throw away from central harlem

798
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,639
and although columbia university is

799
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:28,799
taking over sort of all of harlem now

800
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,240
but you know the maine columbia campus

801
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:31,918
and so

802
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,399
no one can tell me that there's not just

803
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,320
as much drugs being done on columbia

804
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,239
university's campus as there is in

805
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:39,678
central harlem we know who gets arrested

806
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:42,640
who gets tracked who

807
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:44,559
who gets harmed for it and so i just say

808
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:46,399
that to say that simply changing gun

809
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,879
laws without changing policing

810
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,120
doesn't actually get you to a better

811
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:51,679
sort of lived experience and that i

812
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,600
think

813
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:55,200
from a perspective of people who think

814
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,719
about rights

815
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,559
right um when you overlay race you can't

816
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:02,640
just think about the written rules you

817
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,960
have to think about the unwritten rules

818
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:06,880
and you have to uh target your

819
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,880
engagement around those things

820
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,640
and that i think has been the very sort

821
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,679
of important piece of the black lives

822
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:14,480
matter movement

823
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,840
is a specificity around what does it

824
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:18,640
mean to have

825
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,639
um racial justice at the center of your

826
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,720
policy making and when you do

827
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,000
you're able to build policies that

828
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,120
address

829
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:29,520
not just the sort of uh written

830
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:31,678
written letter of the of the problem but

831
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,200
the actual lived experience of the

832
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:36,320
problem

833
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:38,720
right right and i i would um just

834
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,760
add to that i i didn't mean to amen as

835
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,039
you were speaking but

836
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:43,679
you know i was catching the spirit

837
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:45,679
because i i do i do completely agree

838
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:48,399
with you but we saw this in ferguson

839
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,919
right we saw that one of the major

840
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:53,520
problems in ferguson

841
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:57,120
were the municipalities in louis county

842
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:59,918
were using police stops to fund it to

843
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,520
to fund public services and when we did

844
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:03,600
when we looked at that data

845
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,440
we found that black people were 11

846
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,678
percent more likely

847
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,799
to be st to be stopped than white

848
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,320
motorists

849
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,080
and the the and if you couldn't pay your

850
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:17,760
fine you went to jail

851
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,279
and so that is an example of um

852
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,279
you know what we would think about is

853
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,679
disparate impact right

854
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,600
a police stop is a police stop it's just

855
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
that you your taillight was broken

856
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,439
but then if you're targeting this

857
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,039
particular group not just in terms of

858
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,240
criminalization but there's this

859
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:35,760
economic

860
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,840
um impact then that to me

861
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,039
is what i call the technology of

862
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,240
anti-anti-black

863
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:43,360
anti-blackness so just to um start to

864
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:45,600
turn the conversation

865
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,039
a little bit because you have alluded to

866
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,520
this and i it's

867
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:51,520
it's one of the aspects um of your work

868
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,600
that i love and i hate at the same time

869
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,158
but it's so important

870
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,719
it's your corporate strategy so uh you

871
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:58,480
know i

872
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:00,000
i sit in my apartment in brooklyn and

873
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:02,080
i'm like why is he gonna

874
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,519
eat dinner with mark zuckerberg again

875
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:05,279
this is a this is a

876
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
you know a bloodbath we need to come

877
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,240
with guns we need to come with

878
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,480
but luckily i'm not you and i don't have

879
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,440
that access and so you are more

880
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,039
effective

881
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,799
but i'm wondering whether you can

882
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:19,519
without giving away all your

883
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:21,679
secrets kind of walk us through what

884
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:22,559
that what that corporate accountability

885
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,760
strategy

886
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,279
looks like generally really let's know

887
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,158
why it's important i'm very famous

888
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:33,840
for saying that racial justice equals

889
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,279
economic justice

890
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:39,120
and until we have both you are not

891
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:41,360
helping black people and i

892
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,279
you know i'm on the record of saying

893
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,959
that does include reparations for

894
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:47,279
african ameri for

895
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,240
descendants of enslaved people i think

896
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:51,600
that that's

897
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,039
really important and as you're walking

898
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:55,519
us through and this might be

899
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:56,640
nine questions instead of one but as

900
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:58,960
you're walking us through

901
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:00,960
i really want us to get into stop the

902
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,840
hate because that's one of the major

903
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:05,200
reasons i

904
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,559
showed up like i um i'm overstretched

905
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,799
and overtired

906
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:10,240
and um doing a lot of work so i'm not

907
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:11,120
really getting into the details of

908
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,840
things

909
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:15,518
and i would love for you to just let me

910
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,840
in the audience know

911
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,039
more about that campaign in the context

912
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:22,480
of your greater

913
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:22,480
corporate accountability work

914
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,039
yeah i mean so we fundamentally believe

915
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:28,959
that color of change that you

916
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,640
um can advance racial justice without

917
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,720
dealing with corporate power

918
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:33,679
and that corporate power in some ways is

919
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:35,840
such a

920
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:37,760
a force that stands in the way you know

921
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,279
i actually interviewed for our voting

922
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,440
while black podcast

923
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,519
um that actually won a webby award for

924
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:45,919
best political podcast but we

925
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,200
during my voting while black podcast i

926
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:49,039
um interviewed each

927
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,240
of the presidential candidates many of

928
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,919
them and

929
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:54,159
um and what we did was we had a

930
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:56,240
conversation not just about the what

931
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,440
in terms of their list of policies that

932
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:00,399
they want to move

933
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:01,919
but the how because the thing is is that

934
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,600
far too often we'll get a list of

935
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,679
proposals from even

936
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,879
sort of left-leaning candidates but they

937
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:08,399
won't tell us how they're going to

938
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,679
achieve it and they certainly don't tell

939
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:11,518
us how they're going to deal with the

940
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:13,360
forces that stand in the way

941
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,840
of the type of economic and political

942
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:19,039
progress that black people need

943
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:20,158
which is oftentimes the biggest barrier

944
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,559
are corporations

945
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:24,559
i'm right you know the you can send all

946
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,918
the water bottles to flint that you want

947
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,639
but unless you're going to clean the

948
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,559
pipes

949
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:30,640
you're not going to actually have the

950
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:32,399
sort of long-term need and the reason

951
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:34,880
why they don't have clean pipes

952
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:36,479
is because a tax policy that has

953
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:37,519
corporations off the hook from paying

954
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:40,000
their fair share

955
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:41,200
that has put cities and communities

956
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,919
particularly black cities and

957
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,120
communities

958
00:33:41,919 --> 00:33:47,360
on austerity in the richest um uh

959
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,360
country in the world where billionaire

960
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:51,199
where many billionaires exist but then

961
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,399
people don't have like clean water

962
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:54,960
running into their

963
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,840
sort of houses and that is not an

964
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:58,320
unfortunate

965
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:00,639
accident like a car accident it is

966
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:02,158
manufactured and that is why corporate

967
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,760
power is so important to us

968
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,600
and it's why we're the only national

969
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:07,440
black civil rights organization

970
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,040
in the country that does not take

971
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:11,200
corporate financial support

972
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,719
that is a very tricky decision to have

973
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,598
sort of in any environment where you're

974
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,759
raising money

975
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:17,040
but even as the uprisings of george

976
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,800
floyd happen

977
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:20,399
many big corporations were announcing

978
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:21,760
these big checks the color of change and

979
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,118
i was waking up in the morning being

980
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,480
like well they're not

981
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,119
i don't know how they're giving us this

982
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:29,280
money because we don't take it um

983
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,800
and um and sort of having to introduce

984
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
ourselves to corporations that we had

985
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,399
previously maybe

986
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,040
run campaigns on but didn't have ceo

987
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:37,040
level

988
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,599
relationships our relationship with

989
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,679
facebook is unique in that

990
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:43,760
um we have been back and forth with

991
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,800
facebook for five years and in many ways

992
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,800
we had you know

993
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,000
pushed for civil rights audit we had

994
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,800
done a lot of different

995
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,679
things that um sort of helped to kind of

996
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:53,440
um

997
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:55,280
amplify the challenge with facebook

998
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,480
which in many ways started with issues

999
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,880
around policing

1000
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:00,000
the doxing of black lives matter

1001
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:02,400
activists and

1002
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,760
people even from law enforcement showing

1003
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,440
up to folks homes

1004
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,280
the um kareem gaines a black woman in

1005
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:11,040
baltimore had her facebook live

1006
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,400
turned off because the police asked

1007
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:14,400
facebook to turn it off

1008
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,800
while she was in a police interaction

1009
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:20,160
she ended up dead shortly afterwards

1010
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,760
with police having one story and it not

1011
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:23,520
being sort of completely being able to

1012
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,000
backed up with all the sort of visible

1013
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,480
facts

1014
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:27,760
baltimore has recently moving in i think

1015
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:30,720
to settlement of

1016
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,480
multi-million of dollars to the game to

1017
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,439
kareem gaines's family

1018
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:37,040
um and so all of that sort of all of

1019
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,599
these are sort of issues of how we got

1020
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,359
into it

1021
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:45,040
but in 2000 in um late 2018

1022
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,960
sort of in the height of some of the um

1023
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,800
uh back and forth we've been having

1024
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,079
after facebook had already agreed to a

1025
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,400
civil rights audit

1026
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:53,680
after they had announced it and they

1027
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,480
announced it sort of

1028
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,879
with a conservative audit that would be

1029
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,839
um

1030
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,440
done by john kyle a you a former us

1031
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,320
senator who has a history of

1032
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,800
racist and homophobic sort of work but

1033
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,760
they

1034
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,200
once again put this idea of conservative

1035
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,720
bias which is a tax

1036
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:12,720
on conservatives because of what they

1037
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:16,000
believe on the same level

1038
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,720
as attacks on black folks lgbt

1039
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:20,320
women racial other racial ethnic

1040
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,399
minorities for who they are

1041
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,599
and they put those things on the same

1042
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,599
sort of scale because

1043
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:28,079
conservatives have weaponized this idea

1044
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,079
of conservative bias inside of facebook

1045
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,119
and that's part of the sort of really

1046
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,599
chief

1047
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:35,440
um challenge i have with mark zuckerberg

1048
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,200
is that he continues to make decisions

1049
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,000
thinking he understands civil rights and

1050
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,640
he doesn't

1051
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:42,560
he also gets to make decisions that no

1052
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,000
other sort of corporate ceo and other

1053
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:46,320
industries gets to make

1054
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,280
in terms of not having the type of rules

1055
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,320
of the road

1056
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:52,160
and accountability for a platform in a

1057
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,520
and a piece of infrastructure that's so

1058
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:56,960
large and has so much

1059
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:58,480
influence but back in 2018 uh it was

1060
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,839
revealed by the new york times that

1061
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
while we were doing this advocacy

1062
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,279
advocacy work that facebook hired a pr

1063
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,520
firm to launch

1064
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:07,280
attacks on us and i found out when a new

1065
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,040
york times reporter had called me right

1066
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,240
after they posted the story they wanted

1067
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,960
comments on it

1068
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,680
and we had to go in and really figure

1069
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,520
that out

1070
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:17,839
from that point we moved from like

1071
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:19,599
mid-level conversations at facebook

1072
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,078
to senior level conversations at

1073
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:23,839
facebook we've had a lot of back and

1074
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:26,400
forth a lot of meetings

1075
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:26,960
um i want to be really clear i'm at that

1076
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,320
table

1077
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:30,560
and trying to push for some change

1078
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,480
because we have an election coming up

1079
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:34,000
do i believe that facebook can police

1080
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,680
themselves no

1081
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:37,280
do i believe that the federal government

1082
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,480
is going to give us the laws right now

1083
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,040
that we need

1084
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:42,000
no and so we are in a rock in a hard

1085
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,960
place in terms

1086
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:45,440
of how do we push this company to do the

1087
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,040
things

1088
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:49,200
or at least some of the things that

1089
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,759
might be helpful in

1090
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,240
um preventing some of the type of voter

1091
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,680
suppression that we saw back in 2016

1092
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,598
that makes it harder for my people to

1093
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,240
vote that makes it harder for us to cast

1094
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,880
the ballot

1095
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,000
and so in some ways this is harm

1096
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:03,599
reduction work

1097
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:05,599
this is the work that you have to do

1098
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,720
when you have when you don't have all

1099
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:09,599
the other choices

1100
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:10,319
at your disposal um to sort of move an

1101
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,880
agenda

1102
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,760
but part of this stop hate for profit

1103
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,800
campaign

1104
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,440
hopefully for us is us raising more

1105
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,960
um public awareness when you have social

1106
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:23,119
justice organizations

1107
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:25,119
working with sort of uh major

1108
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,720
corporations that no one would see as

1109
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,560
social justice warriors

1110
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:30,480
and you have them all saying the same

1111
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:32,000
thing about some of the practices of

1112
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,599
this platform and how large

1113
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,720
it's gotten right facebook has 2.6

1114
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:40,480
billion users that is more followers

1115
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,480
than christianity

1116
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,359
that means it has a single person

1117
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:48,880
that has 60 of the shares that makes all

1118
00:38:47,359 --> 00:38:51,759
of the decisions

1119
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:53,520
at the end of the day things about that

1120
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:54,320
have to change if we're going to get to

1121
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:56,079
a place

1122
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:57,839
where true accountability and civil

1123
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,320
rights is taken seriously

1124
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:01,759
and in the meantime we have worked to

1125
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,200
raise attention on this

1126
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:04,960
so that hopefully they will make some

1127
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:06,319
changes by the end of august around

1128
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,160
voting they've already

1129
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,760
done some things that were connected to

1130
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:12,240
the demands um but

1131
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:14,000
you know back in june first which was

1132
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:16,160
not the last meeting i had with mark

1133
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,280
but the second to last meeting we had

1134
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:19,759
over zoom

1135
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,000
with mark um and cheryl sandberg and

1136
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,240
other folks we had this meeting

1137
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:26,160
where we were going back and forth on

1138
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:27,680
the donald trump looters and shooters

1139
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,480
post we were going back and forth on

1140
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,399
some

1141
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,160
posts that donald trump had put up

1142
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:33,359
around vote by mail that were clearly

1143
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:36,960
suppressing the vote

1144
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,960
each of these policies violated the four

1145
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,760
corners of facebook's policy his post

1146
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,880
violent trump's post violated the policy

1147
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,119
however

1148
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,720
mark zuckerberg calls up donald trump

1149
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:50,480
and has a conversation with him about

1150
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,720
the looters and shooters post

1151
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,079
and then leaves it up you know i grew up

1152
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,359
in a small town

1153
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:57,599
fifteen percent ten 10 black i know what

1154
00:39:57,359 --> 00:39:59,680
it

1155
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,640
means when the sort of police chief's

1156
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,919
nephew

1157
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,560
sort of violates the same rules that the

1158
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:08,560
um that the black kid down the street

1159
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,759
violates and the black kid goes to jail

1160
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,640
and the police chief's

1161
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:14,319
kid gets like or nephew gets sort of

1162
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,879
like a warning or told like

1163
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:18,560
don't do it again i understand a world

1164
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,240
very clearly where they can have a set

1165
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,599
of written rules but they get applied to

1166
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,279
different people

1167
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,280
differently because of who they are and

1168
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:26,319
their power and so the part of the

1169
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:28,960
problem here

1170
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:30,240
on this platform is that these decisions

1171
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:31,200
that are being made are deeply

1172
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,799
consequential

1173
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:34,240
and doesn't seem to be any sort of

1174
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,640
evaluative force

1175
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:38,240
to sort of monitor how it's being done

1176
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:41,040
they are also just

1177
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:42,240
done through a deep political lens so

1178
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,960
mark zuckerberg

1179
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,000
um the person who sort of oversees the

1180
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,760
department

1181
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:49,520
that makes these decisions about

1182
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:50,319
political post is a guy named joel

1183
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:52,160
kaplan

1184
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:53,680
and joe kaplan sat behind brett

1185
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,799
kavanaugh in

1186
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,839
um during his um

1187
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,040
um confirmation for the supreme court uh

1188
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,078
joe kaplan was um you know famously

1189
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:09,920
in uh florida during the recount

1190
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:11,839
uh for um for al gore and george w

1191
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,440
bush one of those folks in the suits

1192
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,720
that were yelling about

1193
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:18,480
uh um um at the folks who were

1194
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:19,040
recounting and making sure that all the

1195
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,240
votes

1196
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:23,040
were actually counted joel kaplan if he

1197
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,680
were

1198
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:27,440
alive in the 60s would have been part of

1199
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:29,040
the institutions and organizations that

1200
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,560
would have made it so that john lewis

1201
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,720
couldn't vote

1202
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:34,880
that who has that's who mark zuckerberg

1203
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,399
has decided to put next to him

1204
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,520
and help him figure out voter

1205
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:42,960
suppression he has put someone that has

1206
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,960
made a career out of seeing racism as

1207
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,319
not um um a barrier to his participation

1208
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,280
or engagement with political

1209
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:51,279
institutions

1210
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:53,440
and this is the person that mark and

1211
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:55,359
cheryl have defended to me

1212
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,800
multiple times when i have said that he

1213
00:41:55,359 --> 00:41:58,160
should not be involved

1214
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:00,000
in this work and that he should no

1215
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,799
longer be there and so when i

1216
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,920
say um these challenges at these

1217
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,040
institutions

1218
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,839
it's that they um have prioritized

1219
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,720
elevated and given power to people who

1220
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,359
have advanced

1221
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,319
racist causes day in and day out in

1222
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:17,279
their lives

1223
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:19,040
and this is why we also see uprisings

1224
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:21,599
from staff at facebook

1225
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:23,200
who are who understand who joe captain

1226
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:24,960
is and so i want to say to the staff at

1227
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:27,040
facebook who are maybe watching

1228
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:29,119
we see you and we thank you because the

1229
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,480
history of civil rights requires people

1230
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:33,599
on the inside

1231
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:36,640
exposing and pushing back as much as it

1232
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:37,440
does the people on the outside so so

1233
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:40,240
that's um

1234
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,000
i have a million follow-up questions but

1235
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:45,279
i'm i'm just gonna start with

1236
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,680
at that point specifically um as i said

1237
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:50,240
i'm one of your seven million you text i

1238
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,960
do you text i filled in my senses you

1239
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,720
you know

1240
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:55,920
i i like you guys for that you you keep

1241
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:59,200
me yes

1242
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,160
you're what i'm supposed in terms of

1243
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,598
tech worker

1244
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,279
uprisings um i i i live in a district in

1245
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:08,880
new york where we have

1246
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:09,680
just elected a social democratic state

1247
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,720
senator

1248
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,560
for example and part of that platform

1249
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:18,160
was tech accountability

1250
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,119
um specifically and i'm wondering um

1251
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,560
does color of change how what you've

1252
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:22,960
just said thank you to the tech workers

1253
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,880
but

1254
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,240
if you are a tech worker right now

1255
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,800
watching this

1256
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:30,560
what could you do or say from inside

1257
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:32,480
your company outside of your company

1258
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,640
how can you become part of this movement

1259
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,400
is one and then the second

1260
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,720
is just to internationalize the

1261
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:41,920
conversation slightly

1262
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,319
facebook as a company has 2.6 billion

1263
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,359
and i

1264
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:46,480
always um i always tell my facebook

1265
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:48,880
loving family

1266
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:50,400
in zambia that we have a new jesus he's

1267
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:53,119
called mark zuckerberg

1268
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:54,000
and he puts lots of sunscreen on while

1269
00:43:53,119 --> 00:43:56,400
surfing

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:58,000
so we have that jesus came he's here

1271
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,880
hearing democracy

1272
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,839
but then obviously these are it's not

1273
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,760
the only company

1274
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:05,119
right and all of these companies

1275
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,800
microsoft ibm

1276
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:09,599
all of these companies that have come

1277
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:10,000
out and said black lives matter and in

1278
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:13,040
this

1279
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,560
in the case of ibm and micros

1280
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,160
ibm microsoft and um always what i'm

1281
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,599
forgetting it will come back after

1282
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:21,279
the interview and i wish i would have

1283
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:22,800
said it but whatever um

1284
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,640
came out right and said they weren't

1285
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:25,760
going to sell facial recognition to the

1286
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:29,598
police

1287
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:31,200
so how can we for viewers who don't sit

1288
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:34,480
in the united states

1289
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:37,520
what could a color of change esque

1290
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,880
like response be if you're sitting

1291
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:42,480
in brazil and saying hang on we

1292
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,720
you know we really need to do that too

1293
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,839
or how can they join in

1294
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:51,359
to this global color of change network

1295
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,200
yeah so i mean i think a couple of

1296
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:54,078
things i do think that we have to call

1297
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,879
these companies

1298
00:44:54,079 --> 00:44:57,760
out um in very clear ways we have to

1299
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:00,319
find

1300
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,560
in some ways um the places where the

1301
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,000
decisions are made inside the companies

1302
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,720
we have to do um you know we have to do

1303
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:09,520
the work

1304
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,839
um sort of in my opinion of also looking

1305
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,720
at

1306
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:14,560
how looking at behind the statements

1307
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:15,359
that they actually make and so we'll

1308
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:18,319
watch

1309
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:19,598
where they'll say companies may say

1310
00:45:18,319 --> 00:45:21,839
we're not going to sell facial

1311
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:23,760
recognition anymore to law enforcement

1312
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,200
but who are you going to sell it to and

1313
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,079
will they then go sell it to law

1314
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,040
enforcement

1315
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,440
right we have watched the proliferation

1316
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,440
of

1317
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,640
third party vendors especially in the

1318
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:35,200
data space

1319
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,560
sort of circumvent sort of the some of

1320
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,439
the civil rights policies and

1321
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:40,000
protections

1322
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,760
around how race data will be shared and

1323
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:44,960
then how it will be

1324
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:48,240
leveraged and operationalized

1325
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,839
across housing credit um uh

1326
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:52,319
policing um and so much more and so this

1327
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:56,319
is

1328
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,880
um why um this has to be a rights-based

1329
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:58,560
movement

1330
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:01,119
not just a sort of corporate

1331
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:03,759
accountability movement yes we can

1332
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:05,119
make corporations better actors and we

1333
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,280
should be exposing

1334
00:46:05,119 --> 00:46:09,440
the atrocities but we need to expose

1335
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:12,640
them as a vehicle to get

1336
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,920
better laws and you know for us

1337
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:19,040
um i feel a deep sense of responsibility

1338
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:21,440
because i recognize the outsize role

1339
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:24,640
that america has the outside role that

1340
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:26,720
black civil rights can play

1341
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,560
in getting some of these companies to

1342
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:31,279
put in place policies

1343
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:33,279
that we can then use as force

1344
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,000
multipliers internationally

1345
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:38,400
with the recognition that if we force a

1346
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:41,680
new normal here in the united states

1347
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,440
we can use that hopefully as a

1348
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,839
vehicle to push elsewhere that also has

1349
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:49,680
all sorts of downsides because of where

1350
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:52,078
our politics is right now

1351
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,960
and all the ways in which um this sort

1352
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:55,920
of uh

1353
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:57,680
relationship to corporate power that um

1354
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:00,079
our government currently has

1355
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:02,000
these companies right at the end of the

1356
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,160
day care about growth and profit

1357
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:06,000
and so as much as they will make it seem

1358
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:06,960
like they are sort of with us on human

1359
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:09,839
rights and

1360
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:10,240
care about lgbt folks and the climate

1361
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,279
and

1362
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:15,279
racial justice we know that um

1363
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:16,960
it's one thing to say something it's

1364
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,440
another thing to continue to do the

1365
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,079
exact

1366
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,160
opposite and what we consistently see

1367
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,599
over and over again is these companies

1368
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:28,399
making statements of support maybe

1369
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:30,400
even personally the leaders supporting

1370
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,760
the political candidate for president

1371
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,400
that i might support

1372
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:35,280
but then watching them do a whole set of

1373
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,559
things

1374
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:40,559
um that um make it harder for

1375
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,680
um the communities that they say they

1376
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:45,280
care about to

1377
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,759
um exist and be heard okay

1378
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,440
um that makes me that makes me feel good

1379
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:51,680
and we we all have our call

1380
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,880
right this is all of us we all have to

1381
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:55,598
stand together

1382
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,599
and i want to i want to move kind of as

1383
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:00,720
we're closing out our conversation

1384
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:04,240
back to this idea of rights so i

1385
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,399
am absolutely famous for every

1386
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:08,160
uh meeting i'm in particularly those in

1387
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,839
the human rights community

1388
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:14,160
to uh really bulk at the idea that the

1389
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,720
human rights community cares about black

1390
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,440
lives and the reason that i say that is

1391
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:21,359
inner

1392
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:24,079
often in rights rights-based frameworks

1393
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,400
we think about we we don't ever consider

1394
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:29,520
the humanitarian crisis

1395
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:31,480
of being black in the everyday right

1396
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,720
we don't think about the lived

1397
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,800
experiences

1398
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,040
of being over-surveilled being

1399
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,400
overcharged being

1400
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,040
under-educated being and it really

1401
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:42,079
wasn't

1402
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:44,079
until the covert crisis at least

1403
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:46,720
um here in the united states and in the

1404
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:50,319
united kingdom where i'm very confident

1405
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:52,959
of both those and politics where we were

1406
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,079
seeing these racial health disparities

1407
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,800
and people white people started to say

1408
00:48:56,079 --> 00:48:59,440
oh my goodness black lives matter this

1409
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:02,720
you know

1410
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:05,839
this is a problem and my preferred

1411
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,399
frame for what i see in technology is

1412
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:12,160
this idea of automated anti-blackness

1413
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:16,079
right anti-blackness being a theory of

1414
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:19,040
um of extreme violence being visited

1415
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,599
upon black people just because they're

1416
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,960
black

1417
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:25,040
in the most mundane circumstances so

1418
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:26,079
tota you know briana taylor sing on her

1419
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
couch

1420
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:30,000
for example there was another young man

1421
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,598
just before her sing on her couch

1422
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,040
my question um and and i get pushback

1423
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,880
and i and i love all of these

1424
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:38,480
conversations with my civil rights

1425
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,359
friends and thank you rightscon for

1426
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:41,200
inviting me

1427
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:42,640
even having said that but the one thing

1428
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
i will say about rightscon as an

1429
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,200
organization

1430
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,359
is i was really impressed in their

1431
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:50,720
opening ceremony when their

1432
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:52,319
um leader admitted that they didn't have

1433
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:53,680
this racial justice frame and they

1434
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:55,440
weren't putting it

1435
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,440
to the to the front that they could see

1436
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,880
the pain and sudan but they couldn't see

1437
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:00,800
the pain in detroit

1438
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:02,640
and make that make that connection

1439
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,760
between the way those two black

1440
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,879
black communities were being um were

1441
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:09,040
being treated

1442
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,640
so i'm wondering as you talk about

1443
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,319
moving this conversation away from

1444
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:15,040
corporate responsibility

1445
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,640
and moving it into a human rights frame

1446
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:19,759
which is quite frankly

1447
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:21,359
more valuable to us because in u.s civil

1448
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:23,440
rights law that have you have to be able

1449
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:25,520
to prove intent to discriminate

1450
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,520
at least in the human rights framework

1451
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:29,280
we can see this idea of disparate

1452
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:32,240
impact where we just look for patterns

1453
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,400
of discrimination and then we can go in

1454
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,520
my question to you from a color of

1455
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:37,359
change perspective

1456
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:39,040
because i see how you navigate these

1457
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:41,839
worlds between human rights and civil

1458
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:44,079
rights what is this what is the strategy

1459
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:45,440
what is the strategy there and for those

1460
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,400
of us who

1461
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,280
care about black people and care about

1462
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:51,839
black people and

1463
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,640
all their intersections disabled gay

1464
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:55,279
straight

1465
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:56,480
poor not poor you know in all of those

1466
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:59,440
intersections

1467
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,319
what advice would you have for for us to

1468
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:03,520
to

1469
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:05,279
really move this idea and that it's not

1470
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,079
about companies it's about the way we

1471
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:10,400
treat black people

1472
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,240
yeah i mean i think that you you said it

1473
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,960
and i mean i think a couple of things

1474
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,839
that i hear from that is one i think

1475
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:19,359
having the

1476
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:22,160
context in the country having um

1477
00:51:19,359 --> 00:51:23,200
leaders who are indigenous to their

1478
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:25,279
environments

1479
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:27,439
um at the center of this work is so

1480
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:30,000
critically important because you need

1481
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:32,000
um context and that's where sort of in

1482
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,839
the from a u.s perspective i kind of

1483
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,680
oftentimes see the difference between

1484
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:37,520
civil rights and human rights

1485
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:39,440
a lot of tech companies will use

1486
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:42,160
frameworks around human rights

1487
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:44,079
to actually push back against some of

1488
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:45,040
the sort of civil rights protections we

1489
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:47,839
are demanding

1490
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:48,720
because they will sort of prioritize

1491
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,119
this

1492
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:52,319
this i think what is oftentimes a

1493
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,599
misreading

1494
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:58,720
uh first amendment a misreading of

1495
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:00,000
freedom of speech principles um to

1496
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:04,399
supersede

1497
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,520
sort of uh uh anti-discrimination laws

1498
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:12,000
um to supersede sort of other amendments

1499
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:13,200
um and um and 60 you know the 65 civil

1500
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,920
rights law and so

1501
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:17,439
forcing and so forcing facebook to

1502
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,559
recognize that if they're targeting

1503
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:21,280
marketing

1504
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:23,359
is excluding women from jobs or

1505
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:25,440
excluding black people from housing

1506
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:28,000
then that is not simply about someone's

1507
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:30,559
freedom of speech that is actually

1508
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,280
violation of other laws and you have to

1509
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:34,000
weigh

1510
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:35,680
you have to have um a real focus and

1511
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,839
there's always a way in which

1512
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:40,319
i recognize when something hits black

1513
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,078
people in a very specific unique way

1514
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,079
there's a way in which there can be a

1515
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:45,280
reason or an excuse for not people

1516
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,880
taking it on

1517
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,200
and i want to say this just in the

1518
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,119
context that you know as we think about

1519
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:53,200
anti-blackness i think we have to just

1520
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:55,119
continue to interrogate both the

1521
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,240
language that we use around it

1522
00:52:55,119 --> 00:53:00,079
and then and how that leads to type of

1523
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,799
solutions that we

1524
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,880
end up with because oftentimes we end up

1525
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:05,920
starting from a place of how do we help

1526
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,760
black people

1527
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,119
and if we start from a place of how we

1528
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:11,839
help black people

1529
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:13,119
or how do we fix the problems that black

1530
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,880
people are facing

1531
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,319
then we are off then we are already

1532
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,920
starting from a place where we see

1533
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:20,480
blackness as a deficit

1534
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:22,240
and will never actually sort of undo all

1535
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:23,920
the policies and practices and so let me

1536
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,520
just say what i mean by that

1537
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,960
we will call black communities

1538
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,160
vulnerable and

1539
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:32,079
um vulnerability is a personal trait

1540
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:34,000
you know i can be personally vulnerable

1541
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:36,240
if i go on social media and i see an

1542
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:37,839
ex that's way too happy with their life

1543
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:39,040
like that's something i need to work out

1544
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:42,160
for myself right

1545
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:45,759
like i don't like that's personal um but

1546
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:47,520
um but if if we talk about black

1547
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:49,200
communities as vulnerable then we spend

1548
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:50,720
all of our time trying to fix black

1549
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,319
people and black communities

1550
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:54,078
rather than fixing the structures that

1551
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,119
have targeted um

1552
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,920
exploited um um us

1553
00:53:57,119 --> 00:54:00,880
um attacked us and so you know we will

1554
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,559
say things like

1555
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:04,880
black people are less likely to get

1556
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:06,800
loans from a bank instead of banks

1557
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,319
are less likely to give loans to black

1558
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:10,800
people we will say

1559
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:12,880
black women are less likely to uh make

1560
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,280
it to the c-suite of tech companies

1561
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:17,200
instead of tech companies exclude black

1562
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,760
women from the highest level

1563
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,439
right once again we end up with like in

1564
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:23,440
the banking scenario we end up with

1565
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:24,240
financial literacy programs for black

1566
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:26,720
people

1567
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:28,319
instead of actually fixing the systems

1568
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,399
and structures of banking which since

1569
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,920
it's very founding in this country

1570
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:36,559
have excluded targeted uh redlined um

1571
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:38,079
exploited black people in the tax

1572
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,720
scenario we end up with

1573
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,680
pipeline programs mentorship programs

1574
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:43,598
for black women

1575
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:46,160
to help black women somehow do better

1576
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:48,960
inside of a racist exclusionary

1577
00:54:46,160 --> 00:54:50,720
system which has systemically excluded

1578
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,920
them from the very beginning

1579
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:55,118
and so part of i think what i am sort of

1580
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,599
demanding from

1581
00:54:55,119 --> 00:54:59,520
and what asking for um the human rights

1582
00:54:57,599 --> 00:55:02,160
community to recognize

1583
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,559
is that when we talk about black people

1584
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,720
and we talk about systems that hurt us

1585
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,400
we have to talk about the systems in

1586
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:09,279
active voice and black people and

1587
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,520
passive voice

1588
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:13,200
not black people and active voice and

1589
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:15,359
the systems in passive voice

1590
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:17,279
because it is the systems that are

1591
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:20,078
exploiting and targeting us

1592
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:21,520
because we are not trying to fix black

1593
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:24,079
people we are fixing

1594
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,759
and changing and dismantling the systems

1595
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:27,760
that have hurt and targeted us

1596
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:29,359
that is how we get to justice and

1597
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:32,000
freedom because

1598
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,480
all of this work right at the end of the

1599
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:35,839
day

1600
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:36,319
cannot just sin or black pain but has to

1601
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:39,599
also

1602
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:42,160
center black brilliance black creativity

1603
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,640
black joy which is not the absence of

1604
00:55:42,160 --> 00:55:46,319
pain but the presence of aspiration

1605
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:48,879
and the presence of what we are fighting

1606
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:50,799
for all around the world

1607
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:52,880
there are movements that have centered

1608
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:54,160
themselves and modeled themselves off of

1609
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,480
the liberatory work

1610
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:59,118
of black people here in the us off of

1611
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:00,880
the songs the chants and the work

1612
00:55:59,119 --> 00:56:02,559
to fight for a better tomorrow in

1613
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:04,240
freedom so there's nothing

1614
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,240
about that that is from a deficit

1615
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:08,319
perspective there's everything about

1616
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:10,799
that that has actually been focused

1617
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,558
on making democracy work because the

1618
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,400
final thing i'll just say about it as we

1619
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:17,440
head into an election even

1620
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:19,520
is that black people black americans

1621
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:21,839
black people in general are the

1622
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,880
protagonists in the american story of

1623
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:25,119
voting

1624
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:26,720
no group of people have fought better

1625
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:29,040
stood on longer lines

1626
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,359
face more indignities to be able to

1627
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:33,680
express their will for a better future

1628
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:35,440
no group of people have had to face

1629
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,558
foreign dignities threat of violence to

1630
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,040
be educated

1631
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:40,319
just to learn how to read if you sort of

1632
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:43,359
look at the history

1633
00:56:40,319 --> 00:56:46,400
of literacy in this country and slavery

1634
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:49,440
and jim crow all of these things

1635
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:52,000
have been part of the american story so

1636
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,599
we shouldn't be starting our work

1637
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:57,119
thinking about how do we

1638
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:00,319
help and fix black people but how do we

1639
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:00,960
channel what are not unfortunate stories

1640
00:57:00,319 --> 00:57:04,079
of in

1641
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:04,720
of injustice but unjust stories among

1642
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:07,040
justice

1643
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:09,200
and how do we build the power to

1644
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:10,880
actually change the rules long term

1645
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:13,040
and that i think is how we both make

1646
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:14,880
democracy work and when we make

1647
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:16,160
democracy work then we can build the

1648
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:18,880
systems and structures

1649
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:20,000
to make sure that technology doesn't

1650
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:22,559
exploit

1651
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,799
um our holes in our democracy because

1652
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:26,880
the water that pours over the floor

1653
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:29,119
will find the holes and we have a lot of

1654
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,480
holes to fix

1655
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:36,400
oh my god rashad you have just taken me

1656
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:39,520
to church full church i appreciate you

1657
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:40,960
for that um i have admired your work for

1658
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:43,680
years because of this

1659
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:45,280
and and and thank you thank you for

1660
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,118
thank you for putting us in our rightful

1661
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:49,680
frame i think nicole hannah jones and

1662
00:57:47,119 --> 00:57:52,799
others are also doing incredible work

1663
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:54,319
around framing who we you know who we

1664
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:54,720
are and the contributions that we've

1665
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:58,319
made

1666
00:57:54,720 --> 00:58:00,240
so we only have three minutes left

1667
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:01,759
some of me wishes it was 30 minutes but

1668
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:05,200
i'm tired

1669
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,319
so i'm happy and my final question is

1670
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,598
really about that

1671
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,160
so um thank you for this incredible

1672
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,079
conversation but in our email exchange

1673
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,000
prior to us speaking to each other we

1674
00:58:14,079 --> 00:58:16,720
actually were sharing quotes of andre

1675
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,640
law

1676
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:22,959
because both of us are very very tired

1677
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,400
and one of the things that i would love

1678
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,440
for you to help end us

1679
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,599
on is for other black people

1680
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:30,480
who are doing racial justice work in a

1681
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,799
moment

1682
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:34,720
where the world is looking at the fate

1683
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,520
of black people

1684
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,839
what advice would you have for them to

1685
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:43,200
take their rest and to find their joy

1686
00:58:39,839 --> 00:58:46,240
and that's my final question yeah i mean

1687
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:48,879
we i always say to my staff

1688
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,078
i say to myself sometimes is that this

1689
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,880
is all a short

1690
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:55,040
stop on a long journey both a short stop

1691
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:57,359
on a long journey in our lives hopefully

1692
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:59,200
but a short stir stop in a long journey

1693
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:02,880
on the life of blackness

1694
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:04,799
and on the sort of work to dismantle

1695
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:06,400
systemic and structural racism and none

1696
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,599
of this will be

1697
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:10,720
overturned tomorrow there's no piece of

1698
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:12,880
legislation

1699
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:14,319
there's no silver bullet to changing any

1700
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:17,200
of this part of this

1701
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:18,960
is the legacy of work that we are coming

1702
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:20,000
from and the legacy of work that we will

1703
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:22,559
pass on but it

1704
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,240
is about at each phase i think passing

1705
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:26,480
on something bigger

1706
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:28,160
better greater and more open for the

1707
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:29,599
generation that comes behind us and i'm

1708
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,640
talking about the generation of all

1709
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:33,839
races because

1710
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,160
when we end anti-blackness we end

1711
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:38,160
so many other of the systemic harms you

1712
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:40,480
know the final thing i'll just say

1713
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,520
um to the people who are doing this work

1714
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:43,200
is less

1715
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,520
everyone's got their own thing about

1716
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:47,680
self-joy about

1717
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:49,200
personal care and um and all those

1718
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,879
things but the final thing i'll just say

1719
00:59:49,200 --> 00:59:53,759
is that sometimes people will say

1720
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:55,920
we will get um racial justice and gender

1721
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:57,920
justice when we get a true democracy

1722
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:59,839
and i say the reason why we don't have a

1723
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:00,880
true democracy is because we don't have

1724
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:03,920
racial justice

1725
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:07,119
and gender justice and the norms around

1726
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:09,440
our democracy that sort of in

1727
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:10,240
its very founding prevented racial and

1728
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:13,040
gender justice

1729
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,959
is exactly what we need to dismantle so

1730
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:17,119
the work that you are doing if you're

1731
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:19,200
feeling tired and you need a break

1732
01:00:17,119 --> 01:00:21,359
know that it is part of a legacy of not

1733
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:24,000
just ensuring a couple of rights

1734
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:26,160
but is about figuring out whether or not

1735
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:28,240
in a multi-racial society

1736
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:30,558
we can build the power structures for

1737
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:31,520
all of us to be able to have the things

1738
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:34,240
that we need

1739
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,599
and that type of work is not a work that

1740
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,439
happens in a lifetime

1741
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,599
that is work that happens across many

1742
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,040
lifetimes and so let's get to work but

1743
01:00:39,599 --> 01:00:43,200
also let's recognize

1744
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,880
that we are part of it we are not all of

1745
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,078
it

1746
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:50,079
rashad thank you so much for your time i

1747

01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:54,000
