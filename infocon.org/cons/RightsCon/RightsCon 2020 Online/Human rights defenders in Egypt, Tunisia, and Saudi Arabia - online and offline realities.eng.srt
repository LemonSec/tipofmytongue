about um

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:09,680
the situation let's take it from

112
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,120
like the general aspect of it the

113
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,879
situation is

114
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,918
we've been a part of a tremendous change

115
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:21,199
in the last 10 years a change

116
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:24,560
in the society economy

117
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,840
um at regional basis it's like at the

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,080
regional level there is a huge

119
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,320
change um between countries the

120
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:34,240
relations between them but also

121
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,360
there is something very very important

122
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,800
we're now

123
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:42,000
more relying on um

124
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,040
tech platforms uh and on digital

125
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,240
so that is somehow

126
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,919
is shifting our life as we knew it

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,639
um 10 years ago to something very new

128
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:57,120
uh something that we use for example in

129
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,160
tunisia we relied on

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:03,280
the use of facebook for example uh

131
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:06,800
to circulate and relay the information

132
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:10,159
um and the news about the uprising

133
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:12,800
in tunisia now we're facing a new

134
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,440
way of change within the policies of

135
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,280
facebook within the way of communication

136
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,280
between the government and the people

137
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,758
and people between themselves citizens

138
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,239
with

139
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:24,960
citizens between themselves and using

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,960
those platforms um

141
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,320
so the situation is not very different

142
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,359
in other countries

143
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,000
um as activists we rely on the ground a

144
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,400
lot

145
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,520
we do activities on the ground but also

146
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:38,479
we rely on the

147
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,639
digital platforms which makes something

148
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,758
a platform like brightscone a very

149
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,840
important

150
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,960
place to debate and discuss what's

151
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:48,479
happening in

152
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:51,599
um online and offline because they are

153
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:55,199
like very linked um

154
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:59,039
so that i would like to go into

155
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,319
specific examples from uh from tunisia

156
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,280
and um and go to the region but from

157
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:08,720
tunisia let's start with the very recent

158
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,880
um case an attack on someone

159
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:15,440
who shared um a sarcastic

160
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,520
uh post on facebook now we're seeing

161
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
like bloggers they are no longer those

162
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,280
who are holding blocks but

163
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,400
those who are even posting on facebook

164
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,758
in tunisia

165
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:28,239
and other uh countries as well a blogger

166
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,919
called emna shargi has been

167
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,520
targeted for her views for being

168
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:37,440
skeptical and for making fun i code for

169
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,880
making fun of the religion

170
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:43,840
of a verses of the quran

171
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
she literally used the same way of the

172
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,719
quran

173
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,840
to write down a sarcastic attacks

174
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,680
for corona about the coronavirus um

175
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:58,960
that led to a huge attack on her

176
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:59,280
um and it went out from the social media

177
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,638
from

178
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,080
facebook to the court to

179
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:07,199
a life threat to her uh to herself and

180
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,880
her family

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,240
this is the situation um and this is

182
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,360
not an isolated um situation

183
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,039
because if we move to people who don't

184
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,319
share the same views as

185
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,759
ourselves who are posting about

186
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:28,560
politics or certain views um

187
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,360
on social media they are targeted those

188
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,240
who are

189
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,000
taking uh the streets for certain topics

190
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:36,400
they are targeted for that

191
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,440
um and we've seen a lot of hate

192
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,120
campaigns

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,440
we've seen a lot of um

194
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,160
targeted campaigns that went from the

195
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,000
offline

196
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,400
from sorry from the online to the

197
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,720
offline so this is the current situation

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,120
i could give another example

199
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,599
um of a friend of mine a colleague

200
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,639
who was part of a movement a political

201
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,680
movement

202
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,520
in tunisia he was the speaker

203
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,879
the communications person of that

204
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,318
movement and they went

205
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
into um into the parliamentarian

206
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,240
elections

207
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,000
he was targeted and now if you google

208
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:17,360
his name hamza khabar on

209
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:20,080
facebook you would find up to 3 000

210
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,280
posts attacking him this is the

211
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,159
situation right now

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,318
it's disinformation um it's

213
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,000
misinformation of course um

214
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:32,880
and that is a huge topic to talk about

215
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,479
but targeting people for their activism

216
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,439
is a constant

217
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,320
reaction to everybody taking the civic

218
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,680
space

219
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,279
and this is so alarming if we rely on

220
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:47,199
um the gain of tunisia's revolution and

221
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,560
if we say that

222
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,519
um we gained freedom of expression we

223
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:55,518
gained freedom of speech and media

224
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:58,480
unfortunately this is not the case

225
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,760
really because if we take those cases

226
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:04,399
uh they're not individual cases they are

227
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
very significant um those are people

228
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,279
that i know about those are people who

229
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:10,880
are

230
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,279
who um who had the chance to have people

231
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
defending them or talking about them but

232
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,680
there are other people they were

233
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,239
arrested

234
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:19,040
and put in prison from six months up to

235
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
two years

236
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:24,560
for the sake of revealing information

237
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:26,959
or talking about certain topics

238
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,479
political topics in tunisia so this is

239
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,560
the situation right now

240
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,160
it's no longer really that freedom of

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,920
expression

242
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:37,600
and if we take them if we take the

243
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,079
gender aspect of it

244
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,440
if you're a woman you're targeted if you

245
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:44,480
take the civic space

246
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,000
if you um speak out um

247
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:53,200
and i would give them the example of the

248
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:56,480
late uh lina benjamin who was

249
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,160
like during her lifetime i think since

250
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,279
she was nominated

251
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:04,240
um to the nobel peace prize she

252
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,279
was under constant threat for her views

253
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,760
um

254
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,439
so this is one of the situations that we

255
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:12,560
talk about

256
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,959
not enough unfortunately and if we go

257
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,439
out

258
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,719
from tunisia and see other countries

259
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,360
from the region

260
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,320
i would jump to saudi arabia because

261
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:24,000
this is a very

262
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,680
um important case for myself

263
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,600
and unfortunately we don't have lenal

264
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,479
have louis today with us to talk about

265
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,079
it but

266
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,360
always the topic of uh

267
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:36,079
who's been tortured in prison she's been

268
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,240
in

269
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,439
detention for more than two years right

270
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
now no

271
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:43,120
news about her for the last two months

272
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,959
knowing that

273
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,760
covet 19 is in saudi arabia she's likely

274
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:51,199
to have it

275
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:52,319
in prison we have no idea no update

276
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,160
about her

277
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,800
um but if i put it into um

278
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,680
into context let's say legend was

279
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,560
arrested for one reason for speaking out

280
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,479
uh for using her fame being a social

281
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,000
media influencer

282
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,519
to um to raise the issues and talk about

283
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:15,120
the issues targeting

284
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:16,720
women um women's rights in saudi arabia

285
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,760
violence against women

286
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
uh male guardianship and and of course

287
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,720
the right to drive

288
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,880
when they were granted the right to

289
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,600
drive she was behind the bars

290
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,079
and she was subject to torture and she

291
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:31,200
was

292
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,319
subject to smearing campaign not only

293
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:36,800
during her detention but way before i

294
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,480
guess one of the people who received the

295
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:41,599
highest number of

296
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,120
death threats um

297
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,320
and um and other disgusting let's say

298
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,440
messages from the people like um

299
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:52,160
very very um disrespectful type of

300
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,480
messaging

301
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,519
and smearing was eugene and have you

302
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,399
found her

303
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:00,240
her peaceful activism and she was using

304
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,360
the online platforms

305
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:06,480
um so this is the way if we

306
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,000
are um talking about our work

307
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,120
if we're the like not only talking but

308
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,360
if we're highlighting certain topics

309
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,480
we're subject to threats we're subject

310
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,680
to attacks

311
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,240
and this is i would say this is becoming

312
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,359
very

313
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:26,079
um institutionalized um

314
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,800
it's not only attacks from unknown

315
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,680
people

316
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,959
it's not only hate campaigns online but

317
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,319
it goes to

318
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:35,040
a risk like detention arresting the

319
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,399
activist

320
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:40,639
and we have plenty of the um of examples

321
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,279
from the region it's so unfortunate

322
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:45,120
that we have brilliant people and

323
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,560
brilliant activists who are

324
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,880
able to um live up this region

325
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,000
to a better place however they're

326
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,760
detained

327
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:58,800
um we can give plenty of examples

328
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,920
um other than hadlon a lot of

329
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,279
women and amazing men they are detained

330
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:06,959
in saudi arabia

331
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:08,480
for their views not only saudi arabia if

332
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,279
we take the example

333
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,639
of egypt and again unfortunately we

334
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:16,079
don't have lima

335
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
with us but egypt they have plenty of

336
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:19,760
people

337
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,040
behind the bars for the sake of speaking

338
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:24,079
up

339
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:25,839
it's not acceptable i guess um their

340
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:28,719
countries are losing them

341
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:29,200
we're losing faith in the system if we

342
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,240
um

343
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:35,839
continue in having this situation

344
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:37,680
um lately um one of the biggest cases

345
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,800
that i think even the guardian wrote

346
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,399
about this

347
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,319
um is uh the tick-tock

348
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:47,199
girls in egypt random girls who are not

349
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,639
activists

350
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:54,240
just girls using tic-tac they are

351
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:58,560
sentenced to two years with um

352
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:01,760
with a fine up to 300k egyptian pound

353
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:05,518
it's insane for what reason for the

354
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,800
family values is that like a context

355
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,399
um there is a kind of um

356
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,439
a big fear from the systems i guess

357
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,440
um toward those activists and those

358
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:21,279
social media influencers

359
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,320
so we're facing um

360
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:28,000
those very very organized um

361
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:30,480
campaigns online to um

362
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,480
to smear all the activists and people

363
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,160
who have different views

364
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:40,560
um and at the same time uh we're facing

365
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:43,439
um legal uh threats as well so this is

366
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
quite the situation around the the

367
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:47,040
region

368
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,240
um this is from the side of the

369
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:50,240
activists but also

370
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:52,320
those who are talking about for example

371
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,600
let's say the example of

372
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:57,279
um misinformation if you are

373
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:58,800
talking about misinformation you would

374
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:02,959
find a lot of people

375
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,560
uh shutting you up um a little bit of

376
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,279
um it's known in some cases

377
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:11,359
uh cooperation uh with the platforms

378
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:14,160
between the platforms i mean

379
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,720
uh mainly facebook and uh and twitter as

380
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,920
the biggest

381
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:20,880
platforms that we use in this region um

382
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:23,599
and their policies with the civil

383
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:26,560
society so if we're not heard

384
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:28,000
um if we're not in the table if we're

385
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:30,800
not discussing

386
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,720
policies if we're not uh highlighting

387
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,920
and flagging the situation

388
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:36,880
and those targeted uh campaigns against

389
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,120
activists

390
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,360
i guess this freak will follow that

391
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,399
starts online and it follows

392
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:46,560
um offline and there is like

393
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,720
i would say the legal aspect i'm not

394
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:51,518
expert in the legal aspect but

395
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,519
i rely a lot on on my colleagues and

396
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,480
especially on the views of access now

397
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,040
and this

398
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:58,000
um it's very important to highlight that

399
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:01,360
the legal

400
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:04,079
system um is not cooperative

401
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,519
or at least the existing text right now

402
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:08,959
they're not very

403
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:10,639
um in our favor uh when i say our favor

404
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:14,160
i mean activists

405
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:16,240
um it would be good to hear um

406
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,199
other experts and other activists from

407
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,880
the region

408
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:21,839
other journalists talking about the

409
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,240
situation but it's also very very good

410
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,800
to

411
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,839
engage in a discussion like that uh to

412
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:29,519
the nouns

413
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:32,880
um and as any misinformation

414
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:35,360
any smearing campaign would start online

415
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:36,560
i believe our role as activists is to

416
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,240
control that

417
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,839
um to report those uh hate

418
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:45,279
tweets or posts or comments our role is

419
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,320
to denounce this

420
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:50,160
um to come together as activists um

421
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,560
forget about the our different

422
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:56,399
backgrounds and come all together

423
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,000
to denounce this and um speak for

424
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:04,720
um for the others who are unfortunately

425
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:07,439
behind the bars

426
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,720
thank you so much uh anna for sharing

427
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:12,400

um and i know that uh

429
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,480
there are too many cases to cover but i

430
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,640
want to pick on something that you've

431
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:20,319
shared that i really love is that often

432
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,959
human rights defenders that are

433
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:24,000
persecuted in our region they're often

434
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,039
portrayed as

435
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:28,880
is victims of brutal senseless regimes

436
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,280
which is true in a way but they're also

437
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,640
brilliant minds that we are we're losing

438
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
in our communities

439
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:38,240
and i you know i i i mean look no

440
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,799
further at the case of

441
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
who is an egyptian human rights defender

442
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,918
activist

443
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,639
blogger and also an active member of our

444
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,600
community

445
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,240
and who has been part of the rights con

446
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,439
series

447
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,160
um in in since i think the beginning

448
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:57,440
since 2011 and unfortunately

449
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:00,720
he's currently behind bars right now

450
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,280
malaya has been arrested under

451
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:05,280
almost every president in his lifetime

452
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,720
so he was arrested under the presidency

453
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,879
of hasn't evolved

454
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:10,000
then later on muhammad mursi and

455
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:13,039
currently now

456
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,039
and also under the sisia regime he

457
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,400
served a sentence for five years

458
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:20,000
and um upon his release he was also

459
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,320
asked to serve another

460
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,440
five years of having to check in at a

461
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,559
police station

462
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,080
every single day from 6 p.m until 6 6

463
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:30,440
a.m am

464
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,600
and unfortunately last year in september

465
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:34,080
2019

466
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:36,559
he was detained again and since the

467
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,840
start of the pandemic over 19

468
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,039
his family has lost also connection uh

469
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:46,000
to him in march

470
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:46,799
they haven't been able to provide him

471
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,240
with

472
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,039
necessary medical and hygiene and food

473
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,880
supplies

474
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,360
they haven't been able to communicate

475
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:57,600
with him either by sending

476
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:59,678
letters to the prison or receiving

477
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:03,120
letters from him and he has been

478
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:06,720
or was on hunger strike in april um

479
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:10,399
and the situation continues

480
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:13,679
the same story with lujan al hadlul

481
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:15,520
who is spending time um unfortunately

482
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,840
right now we also don't know

483
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:19,280
much about her situation and she has

484
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,000
been subject to

485
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,720
uh torture and sexual harassment in the

486
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:26,240
prison

487
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:29,200
and given the situation of of

488
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,200
the prisons in in our region um and i

489
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,000
would say the inhumane conditions

490
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,000
it's really scary during the covert 19

491
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:39,280
pandemic

492
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:41,039
to just imagine what what is happening

493
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:42,960
uh of the spread of the disease and the

494
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,080
fact that those people don't have access

495
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,080
to information

496
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,399
on how to protect themselves on the

497
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,240
disease on how their families are doing

498
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:51,679
and one of the reasons why we wanted to

499
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:54,799
do this press conference

500
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:56,880
is that often we are faced um with this

501
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,400
this press fatigue that we know these

502
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:00,400
stories you know we know the story of

503
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,679
allah we know the story what's happening

504
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,200
in tunisia and what's happening in the

505
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:06,799
middle east and there is this

506
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:07,520
um fatigue about covering the same story

507
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:09,440
again and again

508
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,520
but what we want to emphasize here that

509
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:14,320
these are stories of real people

510
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,720
um the the suffering of the families is

511
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
real

512
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,039
whether it's the story of legend and we

513
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,039
really would have loved to have her

514
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:24,000
sister with us to share

515
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,640
um the story of the family and also the

516
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,280
same with

517
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,200
with the family of allah and also the

518
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:33,440
families of thousands of others

519
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:36,960
uh who are serving terms in prison

520
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:38,960
um and on on false charges

521
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,559
um and they they shouldn't be in prison

522
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,159
in the first place i mean also to

523
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,520
address case

524
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,559
um his sister is also currently detained

525
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:50,080
um just for the exercise of waiting

526
00:20:48,559 --> 00:20:52,639
outside with her mother

527
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,199
outside of the prison authorities try

528
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:55,600
waiting

529
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,200
to hear to receive a letter from allah

530
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,480
they've been going to the prison on a

531
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,240
daily basis

532
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:05,200
and rather than listening to their

533
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,480
demands and and implementing these

534
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,679
fundamental basic

535
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,280
rights um the egyptian authorities

536
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:13,039
they have actually been harassed they

537
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:15,600
have been

538
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,879
brutally attacked by female thugs it's

539
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,799
also a tactic

540
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,640
used by the egyptian regime to

541
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
intimidate activists

542
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,200
um you know without leaving fingerprints

543
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:26,720
of their security apparatus

544
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,480
and then on the next day when they

545
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:30,720
wanted to go to the public prosecutor's

546
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:34,080
office to file a campaign a complaint

547
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:35,039
um safe has been detained or actually

548
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:38,240
kidnapped by

549
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,039
a civilian by men in civilian clothing

550
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,080
pushed into a van and driven away only

551
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,320
to appear later

552
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,600
in front of the same office the public

553
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,080
prosecutor's office

554
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,120
detained on charges related to misuse of

555
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,439
social media

556
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:52,879
spreading misinformation and fake news

557
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:55,360
about covet 19

558
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:56,480
and inciting to terrorism again going to

559
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,879
the point you mentioned

560
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,480
regarding how legislations in the region

561
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,960
in many countries in the region

562
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,880
obviously it differs from one country to

563
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,840
the other but there is that trend and

564
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,400
pattern

565
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:10,240
of using anti-fake news and cyber crime

566
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
laws and incitement to violence and

567
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,480
terrorism

568
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,480
to um silence people and silence

569
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:17,120
activists and unfortunately it's no

570
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,960
longer about

571
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:21,360
activists anymore as you mentioned the

572
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,480
the case of the tiktok girls

573
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:26,399
many governments in the region are

574
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,919
appointing themselves as the moral

575
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,880
police of people

576
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:32,000
and uh exercising an authority to tell

577
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,679
individuals

578
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,240
what should be said and what shouldn't

579
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:38,159
be said um on social media and on

580
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,600
in the internet based on very vague

581
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
values such as

582
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:46,320
family values or um good ethics and

583
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,799
and public order and and so on i'll stop

584
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,080
here

585
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,960
and i'll open the floor for uh your

586
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,080
questions

587
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:57,600
and um and then

588
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,039
i think we have about 10-15 minutes

589
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:09,840
so i will look to see if there are

590
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:09,840
any questions

591
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:18,159
all right i may add something

592
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:19,360
uh very important to what you were

593
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:23,440
saying

594
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:28,080
um it's we're not talking about

595
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,080
those examples as the only examples like

596
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:33,600
[Music]

597
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,960
which is a very very famous case that

598
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,520
those are people who are

599
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:40,480
known to us known to the international

600
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,960
community or the national community

601
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:47,679
but they hide hundreds of other people

602
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:49,360
across the region who are detained and

603
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,880
if we're speaking

604
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:56,000
and using their names on behalf of them

605
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,880
i guess we're highlighting the issue

606
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:01,039
of the activists across the region if

607
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:03,200
we're asking to free legend and have

608
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,960
for example we're not asking only for

609
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:08,080
beijing but the other women

610
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:10,080
activists like samar badavi or nasima

611
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,000
seda in saudi arabia

612
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:16,840
um if we're asking we're asking about

613
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,080
every other person in egypt who is

614
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,360
detained

615
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,320
for no reason uh who was simply detained

616
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,879
because

617
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:25,439
either posting on facebook or using tick

618
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,720
tock

619
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,159
as a random person or a person who was

620
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:33,440
kidnapped

621
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,039
there is plenty of cases in egypt um

622
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:40,559
that we're using those names as symbols

623
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:44,960
they're our symbols um to address

624
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:44,960
um hate campaigns and to address

625
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,520
this disinformation um and also torture

626
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,720
and sexual

627
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:55,760
violence against uh that did they need

628
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,200
and one of the important

629
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:02,240
uh questions to put here um

630
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:03,360
how they are coping with the covet 19 in

631
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,320
prisons

632
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,120
how is the hygiene over there um in the

633
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,200
case

634
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,279
in the case of legend and the other

635
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,679
saudi activists detained

636
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:14,720
it's a big question mark because we lost

637
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
connection

638
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,039
at least the family of legend lost her

639
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,600
connection for the last two months

640
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:23,279
no phone calls before that there was

641
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,279
only one phone call and before that it

642
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:28,480
was a month without

643
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,120
no news knowing that since the

644
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,720
pandemic started they stopped the

645
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:36,479
in-person visits

646
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,159
so it's a lot of big question marks

647
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:43,039
and again we should not stop our role as

648
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:45,279
activist it's not to stop talking about

649
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,158
those cases and denounce

650
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:50,320
those practices of tracks nearing

651
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:54,240
campaigns disinformation against

652
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:56,960
activists and also to call on the

653
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:58,000
tech platforms to be more cooperative in

654
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,880
terms of

655
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:03,360
taking down some um violent comments

656
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:03,360
let's say

657
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:13,360
um thank you very much anna we have one

658
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:14,639
question um i guess it's related to

659
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,879
taking action

660
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,640
what can be done what are the proposed

661
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,000
adaptations to this reality

662
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:21,760
and what should be the goal at this

663
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,640
stage when international support for

664
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,840
these values

665
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
are waning

666
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:34,159
so i mean if we take um

667
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:35,520
take one action at a time it would be

668
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:39,120
not letting them down

669
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:42,158
first speaking up on their behalf

670
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:45,600
um making sure they're not forgotten

671
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:48,640
um i so much believe in this power the

672
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,279
invisible power of when we speak about

673
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,279
them

674
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:53,200
they will definitely end up here because

675
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,559
they have no access to information no

676
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:57,600
access to news

677
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,960
most of the time um but they

678
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,320
rely on us and if we keep speaking and

679
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,400
we keep addressing

680
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,240
and if we have an international support

681
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,080
from different organizations

682
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,960
and different governments that would be

683
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:14,399
good uh that would be very very good to

684
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:16,480
to their cases um and to avoid having

685
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:20,640
more activists detained

686
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,679
um it's it's uh it's so um

687
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:27,440
at certain times we feel so hopeless

688
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,520
um very hopeless um

689
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,520
when we say for example that lujan has

690
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:35,120
been detained for two years

691
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,158
um and we did not do much uh we still

692
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,639
feel we did not do

693
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:39,840
much for her and especially knowing that

694
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:43,279
the person who

695
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,720
um observed her torture is free

696
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:49,919
um it's unacceptable uh but

697
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,799
what we can do is we still have to to

698
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:54,640
fight

699
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:56,639
and to talk about her um and to ask and

700
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:58,320
seek the help of international the

701
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,159
international community

702
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,120
a community sorry um and it's it's

703
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,320
uh it's very important that um

704
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,719
organizations

705
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:09,840
like accessnow and other organizations

706
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,960
would be

707
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,158
talking and stepping uh and supporting

708
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:18,799
um those activists it's very important

709
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:20,080
also to support activists who are under

710
00:28:18,799 --> 00:28:23,918
threat right now

711
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:26,000
who are receiving um like being targeted

712
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:29,440
for their activism online

713
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:30,799
um by a hate campaign um it's very

714
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:34,720
important to give a

715
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:37,520
give them uh support legal support

716
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:39,600
um in certain cases financial support or

717
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:43,279
asylum in other cases

718
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,399
um but it's it's not

719
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:49,600
let's not wait until they are

720
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:50,559
arrested let's say let's uh let's be

721
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,480
there for

722
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,158
for them yeah i want to build up on what

723
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:58,480
you mentioned i think

724
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,279
many regimes in the region bet on the

725
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:01,600
waiting game

726
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,720
that people will you know eventually

727
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,959
give up hope

728
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,919
and uh because the situation looks so

729
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,919
hopeless

730
00:29:05,919 --> 00:29:10,080
sometimes that they think you know

731
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:13,279
people will eventually forget

732
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:14,080
and they can get away uh with their

733
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:16,080
impunity

734
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:17,439
um and without being held accountable

735
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:20,480
for their human rights

736
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,480
abuses and and violations um

737
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,320
so i guess you know we have also another

738
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:27,919
question asking the same

739
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,120
uh like what can we do to uh

740
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:33,679
to defend uh human rights defenders

741
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:35,439
and activists and i guess you've

742
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:37,600
answered this question already by

743
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:40,080
raising our voices and to continuously

744
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:42,799
raise these issues whenever we can in in

745
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,600
every venue and platform that we have i

746
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,879
have a

747
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,840
second question also uh

748
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,360
from kindell cell system i hope you are

749
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:54,080
pronouncing the name right

750
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,678
um does mina also have trolls claiming

751
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:58,960
that cancel culture

752
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:02,000
is depressing mainstream views if so

753
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:03,440
have you found strategies to push back i

754
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:05,600
would also want to add

755
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,799
an additional question to this we've

756
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:10,240
witnessed um

757
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,480
in beginning of this year also

758
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,760
governments using troll campaigns on

759
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,200
social media

760
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,520
to call for the arrest and the

761
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,600
prosecution of certain activists

762
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,200
that look at the at the surface that

763
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,039
they are just normal people

764
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:25,120
normal citizens asking for the

765
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:26,879
prosecution of a certain individual for

766
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,239
violating whatever

767
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,960
um they deem uh should not be violated

768
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,240
so for example public order or good

769
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,440
values etc

770
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,760
but actually these are being

771
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:39,679
orchestrated by the

772
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,799
by certain governments in order to

773
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,520
legitimize

774
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:45,279
the arrest so you know that this is what

775
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,720
people were calling for

776
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:52,000
um so do you do you think that this is a

777
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:54,320
pattern across the region or is it

778
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,120
like to certain specific cases the one i

779
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,480
mentioned is

780
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,840
um in in saudi arabia i can't recall the

781
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:03,200
name of the activist

782
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:04,158
at the moment but she was detained i

783
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,279
think in april

784
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,279
uh this year i'm using this tactic

785
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,880
so i think it's a practice across

786
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:17,519
certain countries in the region it's not

787
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:21,039
in every country

788
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,240
but those trolls um if we

789
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:26,480
take the case um when it happens to be

790
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,360
elections we've seen that those polls

791
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:30,000
that

792
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,519
from other countries they were targeting

793
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:35,360
tunisia for example

794
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:38,640
and if we were to um link this to

795
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,760
um to the taken down of them certain

796
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:45,760
um facebook accounts in tunisia

797
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:46,399
and in may 2020 there was a link between

798
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,320
uh

799
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,320
some accounts not all of them and um

800
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,799
and a company a um a marketing

801
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,760
communications company in tunisia that

802
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,679
did the same

803
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:01,200
more or less in the francophone

804
00:31:59,679 --> 00:32:04,320
countries in africa

805
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,559
um they are using trolls um

806
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:08,399
and for the time being if we follow the

807
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,840
political scene in tunisia

808
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:14,879
trolls are targeting certain figures

809
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,199
who are not activists for the for this

810
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,559
time they're targeting political

811
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:23,360
um persona um for

812
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,840
um like certain agendas it's it's

813
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:29,840
becoming something across the region

814
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,600
um in other countries like saudi arabia

815
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,559
um amid the detention of legend

816
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:37,918
and at the time uh as his abusive

817
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,240
immense

818
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:47,039
other uh men detained with them

819
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:50,159
they were trolls um using them

820
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:52,158
i forgot the hashtag um i think they

821
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:54,720
were using a certain hashtag

822
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:55,760
some of the those accounts they have

823
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,360
behavior

824
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,960
but the others they were like they

825
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,678
looked like normal

826
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:02,320
accounts but they were only used to

827
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:06,000
attack

828
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:06,960
the detained um activists and that did

829
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,000
not stop with

830
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,039
it with that campaign uh

831
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,440
against uh and the others but

832
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:16,720
it continued to to target other

833
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:19,760
activists

834
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,720
um we rely a lot on

835
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,039
um picking that behavior being aware of

836
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:25,919
it

837
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:26,960
as civil society and addressing it

838
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:30,320
reporting those

839
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:31,679
accounts and um which are now to the

840
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:34,960
platforms

841
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:38,880
um with a list of the accounts and

842
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:39,360
um an action a list of um action points

843
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:42,880
to

844
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:46,479
uh to be done um it's very important

845
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,600
i guess um if we see that

846
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:50,840
as individuals as activists uh not only

847
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,158
in the frame

848
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,480
of let's say organizations or

849
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:59,840
international organizations but also as

850
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:03,440
individuals is to report those trolls

851
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:05,519
um it's our duty i guess

852
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:07,919
to make sure that we address this there

853
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:08,719
is no concrete strategy for that we're

854
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:11,599
not going

855
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:12,399
if they go low we don't go low like them

856
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,200
um

857
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,040
there is no um for the time being there

858
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:20,480
is no strategy to com

859
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:22,399
to counter this but the nonsense writing

860
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,599
and collaborating with the tech

861
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:26,799
platforms

862
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:29,440
um i'm very skeptical on um

863
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,079
adopting laws in that sense because they

864
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:33,359
can be

865
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,720
misused um in certain ways

866
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:41,040
and under certain circumstances against

867
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:46,000
um non-um non-bot behavior for example

868
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:49,040
so let's use um civic actions instead of

869
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,599
legal actions in that sense uh

870
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,320
but it's it's very very good to raise

871
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:54,320
this question

872
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,200
thank you uh we have more questions

873
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,079
coming in so

874
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,240
uh we have a question from todd clauduan

875
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:06,400
he says related to policing speech

876
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:08,479
on the internet countering smear

877
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,119
campaigns and disinformation online

878
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:12,000
requires

879
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:14,400
massive time and resources how can

880
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,119
activists with limited means address the

881
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,599
root problem

882
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:22,800
that's a very good question and it's

883
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:26,480
very very realistic

884
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:28,079
even even facebook failed in taking down

885
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,440
certain

886
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:34,720
comments or addressing or uh picking

887
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:37,920
certain campaigns um

888
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:39,200
and here i would give an example from

889
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,400
tunisia

890
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,720
um of one of the activists at the time i

891
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:46,079
think

892
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:49,680
two years ago she was targeted by a

893
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:52,960
smearing campaign um a hate campaign

894
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:55,279
uh she's a gender activist her name is

895
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,599
fabiel jefferdin and we had

896
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,240
um she she was subject to that campaign

897
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:05,440
but for two years she did not notice

898
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:08,879
that there was a huge amount of

899
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,599
um targeted costs against her that she

900
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,960
did not

901
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,440
um pay attention to

902
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,760
to them until she was physically

903
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:21,040
targeted in the streets and she

904
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,000
um she linked all of those incidents all

905
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:25,359
together

906
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,200
um and of course um

907
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:30,000
we i guess we rely as she did at the

908
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:33,520
time

909
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,119
on um on certain mechanisms like

910
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:40,000
accessnow's health team

911
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:41,520
which they were there for her to support

912
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:43,680
her in that campaign

913
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:45,440
um but also there are other

914
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,279
organizations to do that

915
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,359
it's amazing how they can do this work

916
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,839
it's amazing in a in a bad way not in a

917
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:55,920
good way of course

918
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,320
um how they can allocate

919
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,320
that time and money for that so it's

920
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,440
very very difficult for us as activists

921
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,119
to counter it

922
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:08,480
but if we work in communities if we work

923
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,119
all together individuals activists

924
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,119
and organizations national and

925
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:14,560
international organizations it's very

926
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,920
very important

927
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:23,839
we will reach a point where we can um

928
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,839
have like limit um that kind of practice

929
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,880
thanks you mentioned the helpline i

930
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:31,440
think it's suitable to

931
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,640
mention few words about our helpline

assistance

944
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,960
we have a follow-up question from candel

945
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:08,079
on the troll armies or troll accounts

946
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,880
she says

947
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:11,599
um reporting those troll accounts does

948
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,640
it work

949
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:20,160
and are they responsive and i guess they

950
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:22,160
um it refers to social media companies

951
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:23,440
so in some cases yeah they are

952
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,078
responsive um

953
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:28,720
in other cases no let's not take the the

954
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,000
current situation with the covered 19

955
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,799
the responsiveness is way

956
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:37,359
less than the usual uh but in certain

957
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:40,720
cases we collaborated with the

958
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:43,920
tech companies as organizations

959
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,720
as um not only one organization but

960
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,640
different organizations who are working

961
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,560
on the topic of content federation and

962
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,680
they were responsive to certain

963
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:54,880
extent i would love to see them more

964
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:58,319
responsive and

965
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:59,760
i would love to see them take the

966
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,880
initiative of

967
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:04,000
checking certain certain accounts with

968
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:06,240
the experts with

969
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,760
organizations who are working in the

970
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,520
ground

971
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:12,880
so for example if i get the case of

972
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,440
facebook they have trusted partners

973
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:17,200
in certain countries and uh for example

974
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:18,320
in tunisia they have certain trusted

975
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,759
partners

976
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:24,960
and i would love um to see facebook

977
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:27,839
richer now to those trusted partners

978
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:29,280
before taking the decision of taking

979
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:31,759
down certain um

980
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:34,640
accounts for example so there they would

981
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:35,680
be limitation of the collateral damage

982
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,040
let's say

983
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,640
um but they should do more

984
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:46,480
because as they move those trolls

985
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,040
in those um units at certain point

986
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,720
they're government units they are

987
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,680
companies startups who are

988
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:57,439
using different mechanism and they know

989
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,960
how facebook operates they know how

990
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,160
twitter operates

991
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:06,160
um so they can

992
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,759
navigate those systems let's say

993
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:10,799
it would be good to keep to keep working

994
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:13,599
working with

995
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,680
um the people on the ground who have

996
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,160
understanding of the situations

997
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,680
happening in the ground if we're talking

998
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,839
about tunisia there are

999
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:25,040
trusted partners in tunisia there are

1000
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:28,319
trusted organizations at national level

1001
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:30,560
that they can reach out to to work with

1002
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:31,839
in addition to them to the governmental

1003
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,880
institutions

1004
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,359
uh who would help in certain cases um

1005
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,000
in other countries as well i guess

1006
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:40,960
access now

1007
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,760
is a good um key contact across the

1008
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:44,960
region of

1009
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,280
um uh the mina region uh but

1010
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,800
in other regions as well it's not it's

1011
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,160
not only the mean

1012
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:55,200
this situation we have seen um

1013
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:57,200
different points um common points

1014
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,000
between nina region and other regions

1015
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:00,000
across the globe

1016
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:04,799
it's actually very important to note

1017
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,439
because indeed this is not only special

1018
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:09,760
to the mina region unfortunately

1019
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,480
we have one last question uh before we

1020
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:13,760
end our

1021
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:16,000
press briefing from

1022
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,440
tom he's asking is there anything in

1023
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,640
particular that men

1024
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:22,240
can do to support your work more and he

1025
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,118
says i'm just baffled hearing your

1026
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:26,640
stories

1027
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,920
i actually like this question ah

1028
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,200
it's a very good question um

1029
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:36,319
it would be men behaving as

1030
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:37,520
uh as humans it's like it's really

1031
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:41,200
really good

1032
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:44,240
um that you give the floor um

1033
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:44,879
and you see the other um how we're

1034
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,078
suffering

1035
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:48,880
and to a certain extent if we take the

1036
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,040
case of

1037
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,160
men activists and women activists

1038
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:57,520
and given the circumstances across our

1039
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:59,359
region

1040
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,520
only women would be arrested for the

1041
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,598
family values for example

1042
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,880
i i bet it's it would be really crazy

1043
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:10,640
from a government to

1044
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:13,680
um to arrest somebody for family values

1045
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:17,359
unless that person is really really

1046
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,919
has really committed um a crime

1047
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:21,279
uh but it's like it's very very

1048
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,720
important to understand

1049
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:28,880
how women are being treated and not be

1050
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:32,160
part of relying relaying the information

1051
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,960
or the news about women support women uh

1052
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,000
stop harassment address it when a man

1053
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,560
when another man

1054
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,359
is talking and harassing women sent by

1055
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:42,560
the women

1056
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,680
don't stand by the men by manhood

1057
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,078
don't mensplain women online try to

1058
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,319
avoid that this is very very important

1059
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,599
um and thank you thank you so much for

1060
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,040
your question

1061
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:55,920
um because we cannot do that as women

1062
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:58,400
only i

1063
00:42:55,920 --> 00:43:00,000
i truly believe that men and women

1064
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:03,359
should work together

1065
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,720
um toward a better understanding

1066
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,440
a safer internet um

1067
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,560
so thank you very much and bring more

1068

1070
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,800
disappointed
