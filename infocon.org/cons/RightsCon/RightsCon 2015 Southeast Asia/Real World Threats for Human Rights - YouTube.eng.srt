5
00:00:14,549 --> 00:00:18,619
so it's going to be oriented towards

00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:24,448
security talk that sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,349
little bit about some specific threats

most famous product is the intercept

sort of BS north reporting and

publishing documents that leaked by this

46
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,820
interchangeably I'm assuming most people

in the audience would be loosely

familiar with these concepts largely

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:12,150
based on kind of stuff like this right

50
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:14,260
like most people have been on the

54
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:25,958
and not wearing the way what I'm

00:02:22,329 --> 00:02:28,269
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about today so when</font>

56
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:29,349
people ask me so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware is I like</font>

57
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:31,680
to tell them<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's sort of any</font>

58
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,629
software that shows up on your computer

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,640
without an end user license agreement so

60
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:38,700
if you can click on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to say yes I want</font>

61
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,929
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> install this then it in its malware</font>

62
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:45,040
but for the purposes of this discussion

63
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:47,200
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about software that</font>

64
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:49,480
essentially record stuff that people do

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,250
on their computers documents they type

66
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:56,290
conversations they have communicational

67
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:57,519
video chat and so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so forth I mean</font>

68
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,730
laughs lightly all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

might want to surveil someone's online

70
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:10,089
act now let's go on mobile and obviously

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:13,870
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> whose governments fire and topless</font>

72

00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,139
folk or commonly going to use and they

78
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,299
provide all sorts of interesting

79
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,120
capabilities you know logging your phone

80
00:03:31,299 --> 00:03:36,370
calls and text messages usefully

81
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,379
tracking a fuser location by the GPS

82
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:42,069
tomorrow and probably most creepy

83
00:03:38,379 --> 00:03:44,410
believe the ability to part like the

84
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,048
phone and so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone sort of</font>

85
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,540
still looks like this but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's ambient</font>

86
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:51,549
leaving everything arise itself um we

87
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,780
kind of sort of odd doing research on

88
00:03:51,549 --> 00:03:55,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">this because I was sort of looking</font>

89
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:58,690
through sort of<font color="#CCCCCC"> addie compilation of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,150
code in this particular type of empire

91
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:03,400
theme of the actual function that the

92
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:06,099
the developer used was called spike or

93
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,540
um and when I looked in her eyes with

94
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,970
this done it sort of led to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this odd</font>

95
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,948
distance between myself and this is

96
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:13,239
device which I'm quite close to<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you</font>

97
00:04:11,949 --> 00:04:14,919
know I wake<font color="#E5E5E5"> up in the morning and like</font>

98
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:16,810
lots of<font color="#E5E5E5"> pic addicts I get straight on</font>

99
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:18,159
Twitter you know and all of a sudden I

100
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,470
found myself looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and I was</font>

101
00:04:18,159 --> 00:04:22,450
like yeah maybe I should she put this in

102
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:25,070
the freezer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like never</font>

103
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:27,180
become one of those people

104
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,400
so yeah it's talking to be a lot about

105
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:31,470
really cheerful stuff I'm the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last I</font>

106
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,919
have a sort of a background<font color="#CCCCCC"> in doing now</font>

107
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,380
a research<font color="#E5E5E5"> I add some the last really</font>

108
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">big thing that I did was I released an</font>

109
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:41,909
analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> I released the south to</font>

110
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:47,660
download a bunch of spy software that

111
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">was used by primarily the GCHQ which is</font>

112
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:53,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Britain's communications surveillance</font>

113
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,969
establishment is equivalent to be in<font color="#E5E5E5"> SF</font>

114
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:59,010
bay and it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was used in attacks on the</font>

115
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,380
European Union<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Belgian home by the</font>

116
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:06,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">buyers and so I released this really</font>

117
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:08,040
intercept now this is this attack I've

118
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,989
got a sort of considerable amount<font color="#CCCCCC"> risk</font>

119
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">because there are some people who felt</font>

120
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:13,860
that you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> five eyes in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the UK</font>

121
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:16,350
particularly spying on the closest

122
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,620
allies and the European Parliament and

123
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:25,110
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> Belgian was a little beyond pale</font>

124
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:27,180
now because of the amount of press like

125
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:29,670
this type of attention has got its kind

126
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">of oddly skewed people's perceptions of</font>

127
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:37,110
threat and risk now for people<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

128
00:05:32,670 --> 00:05:39,920
room the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NSA and the GCHQ probably like</font>

129
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:43,020
your biggest probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

130
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:45,840
maybe you<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys have stacks of it Soviet</font>

131
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:48,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">newts that they aware of but but again</font>

132
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,099
you know but what I wanted to do is I

133
00:05:48,870 --> 00:05:54,750
actually wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of discuss risk</font>

134
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,670
and threat in a way that I thought would

135
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:59,250
help people with their security problems

136
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,590
rather than actually hinder them so most

137
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:04,230
people model threat really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really bad</font>

138
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,820
and it's kind of like we actually and

139
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:07,410
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this isn't just online this is in</font>

140
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:08,940
real life right this is why we're

141
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:11,400
worried about terrorists but not drunk

142
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:13,260
drivers we're worried about<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting a</font>

143
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,340
bowler but not heart disease you know

144
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,390
who's we worried about like really

145
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:21,179
visceral things things that in news and

146
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:22,890
so I've<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent close the two decades now</font>

147
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,280
worrying about security problems I spent

148
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:28,229
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time tracking nation-state</font>

149
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,679
attacks against<font color="#CCCCCC"> high-risk users so I</font>

150
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,810
have a very regular understanding / what

151
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,630
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these types of streets look</font>

152
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,770
like and actually valid does of them

153
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:39,830
frequency

154
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:42,680
oh and that means because<font color="#E5E5E5"> of because of</font>

155
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:44,539
the news and get people are like so I

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,030
read this thing about the NSA the other

157
00:06:44,539 --> 00:06:48,919
day and now I am super worried about all

158
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:50,330
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-level firmware on my computer</font>

singer together you're like a nice<font color="#CCCCCC"> day</font>

164
00:07:04,009 --> 00:07:12,500
any reason<font color="#E5E5E5"> why you would think that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you've Utah article yeah other them this</font>

another<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting next what's right</font>

168
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:28,419
what your your cellular phone it's the

169
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:32,199

<font color="#CCCCCC">feeling system right and it's IRS a</font>

173
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,890
as far as i can tell for like six

174
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:53,280
seasons he just ties people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with chairs</font>

175

<font color="#E5E5E5">and tortures them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

176
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,609
sort of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> final in what actually</font>

177
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:01,710
happens if you know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> information that</font>

00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">the state wants or whatever your try to</font>

179
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:04,680
get it they cut they can't get it this

180
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,299
this is this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the final</font>

181
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of what could happen now this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

182
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">really really expensive because you need</font>

183
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,340
you know in theory you need black sites

184
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:16,290
you need people<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are willing to pull</font>

185
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:18,119
out other people's TV and then it's not

186
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,340
it's politically difficult like you get

187
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,200
Obama standing up television like I'm

188
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,150
sorry we tortured some folks you know I

189
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't actually you know you just</font>

190
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">generally don't like admitting to</font>

191
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,700
torture and then you get people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

192
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,630
this kind of crowd really human rights

193
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:36,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">activists and it's a nightmare right and</font>

194
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,700
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> not actually an expert in</font>

195
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:40,830
information extraction through torture

196
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,280
so we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to dwell on listen</font>

197
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:45,450
this type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> anymore but but what</font>

198
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:47,520
I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into is I want to</font>

199
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,590
discuss now let now we've talked about

200
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of different types of actors that</font>

201
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,820
you said that you're worrying about in

202
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:54,870
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> security model what I want to do</font>

203
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,940
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is actually talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the players</font>

204
00:08:54,870 --> 00:08:59,040
like who has these capabilities because

205
00:08:56,940 --> 00:09:00,480
now you know the types of attack that

206
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,520
might be brought to bear advanced you

207
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,800
chances are you probably know who you're

208
00:09:02,520 --> 00:09:07,590
worried about so let's talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

209
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:09,540
those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> can actually do so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

210
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,460
this is the GCS cheering and this is a

211
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,740
reality outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheltenham and this is a</font>

212
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,450
drawing by banksy british graffiti

213
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,270
artists so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a poem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group the</font>

214
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:21,140
bunch of governments groups you know

215
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:23,370
attempt to the attached phone with and

216
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:27,030
it works better the National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Security</font>

217
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:29,910
Agency obviously and so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

218
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">high-end actors right and so the five</font>

219
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:33,920
eyes this is Israel

220
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,660
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of taught me an actor so does</font>

221
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:44,010
this does this company<font color="#E5E5E5"> does this country</font>

222
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:46,020
have a large<font color="#E5E5E5"> military industrial complex</font>

223
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:47,910
do they have a Silicon Valley a large

224
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,079
getting a little screen perhaps but like

225
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:51,300
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff doesn't spring up</font>

226
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:53,970
overnight right like this is is you know

227
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">50 year ramp up times to developing this</font>

228
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:58,080
type of capability not so much<font color="#CCCCCC"> an into a</font>

229
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:06,240
software but in terms of like a culture

230
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:08,730
right so they may act as an old small

231
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,520
batch you know the spokes valence

232
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:14,310
software<font color="#E5E5E5"> coded themselves</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and house you</font>

233
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:16,980
know and the people that write it better

234
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:19,319
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> feared you know smoothies and</font>

235
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:23,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">get facials while they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> write they kept</font>

236
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:25,710
Linnell it's all very<font color="#CCCCCC"> lunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got a</font>

237
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:27,839
kind of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> second-tier right and and</font>

238
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,420
these are these are governments that

239
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:32,820
have cash but don't necessarily

240
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,920
traditionally have the in-house

241
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,630
capability to create these two so tools

242
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,490
right like they're just trickle the last

243
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:40,200
few years realize they really want on

244
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:41,370
this highly desirable so what they're

245
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:43,110
going to do is they going to buy them

246
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:45,080
and so primarily what this does is it

247
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:47,850
means that governments are purchasing

248
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:50,670
primarily from Western contractors so

249
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,040
you know people gain this capability by

250
00:10:50,670 --> 00:10:54,990
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for Western governments and they</font>

251
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,550
leave send a private<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

252
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:58,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want to make money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then start</font>

253
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,819
selling this type of technology to other

254
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:03,740
governments and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

255
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:06,060
middle tier it's a commercial market

256
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:07,950
this type of software is frequently sold

257
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,239
to law enforcement intelligence agencies

258
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,560
and countries that don't have the

259
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,260
capability or right to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop themselves</font>

260
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,239
and occasionally it's kind of gross you

261
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:18,990
sort of see it's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> to security</font>

262
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:20,100
companies that will do<font color="#CCCCCC"> things which</font>

263
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:22,080
might beep instead of juubi three

264
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,390
difficult and this type of access

265
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:28,260
service is a pay for tools strider

266
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:32,040
vector after this what you have is you

267
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:33,300
have a strata that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">resonates so you'll get groups and I've</font>

270
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,950
seen groups in India Bangladesh like Leo

271
00:11:39,330 --> 00:11:44,580
impact and appen and that sort of thing

272
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:46,320
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can you can hire and they</font>

273
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have websites right you can</font>

274
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,329
hire ethical hackers as digital private

investigator

276
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:55,079
we have a think about a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit about</font>

277
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,639
what that actually means so frequently

278
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:57,868
what that means is say you have a court

279
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,579
case you really want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

282
00:12:01,589 --> 00:12:04,559
they'll hack the opposing counsel and

00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:07,350
steal their emails<font color="#E5E5E5"> doctor that's given</font>

00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:12,929
that are bringing<font color="#E5E5E5"> all sort of important</font>

suits against against government actors

288
00:12:12,929 --> 00:12:17,939
they we've seen seen the use of these

289
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,410
plans in areas like Angola and so forth

290
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:22,199
so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even really want to pay for</font>

291
00:12:19,410 --> 00:12:24,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">tools right this is a paper job style</font>

292
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,118
scenario right like you don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

293
00:12:24,809 --> 00:12:28,410
infrastructure to build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own tools</font>

294
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:30,720
you don't actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really buy these</font>

295
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:34,589
tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> to service but you have stuff that</font>

296
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:36,299
you need done right now and then is this

297
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:38,279
this one that like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

298
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:40,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">security industry</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is traditionally been</font>

299
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:41,369
really worried<font color="#CCCCCC"> about right and this is</font>

300
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:43,259
cybercrime and this is sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

301
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:45,119
Russian business Network these are

302
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:46,559
people who like to steal banking logins

303
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:48,569
on mass and that sort of thing in your

304
00:12:46,559 --> 00:12:50,488
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially monetizing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cybercrime</font>

305
00:12:48,569 --> 00:12:54,599
on the internet now you know this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

306
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:57,299
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about getting paid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so for</font>

307
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,149
all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these actors actually the equation</font>

308
00:12:57,299 --> 00:13:03,119
is kind of the same and that's the

309
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:05,220
resources that the attacker has this is

310
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:08,220
the amount of<font color="#CCCCCC"> money that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will cost to</font>

311
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:11,459
carry out<font color="#E5E5E5"> a tab this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is the value</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

312
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:14,100
target and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this kind of one room</font>

313
00:13:11,459 --> 00:13:16,738
is a strata that doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really fit this</font>

314
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:18,480
and that's a disinfecting business and

315
00:13:16,739 --> 00:13:21,149
black hats right and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just these</font>

316
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:26,389
people operate largely based on ideology

317
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:30,899
um and their motivations a personal

318
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:35,910
frequently pity and in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case of</font>

319
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:37,379
blackheads and<font color="#E5E5E5"> their frustrating because</font>

320
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,509
you read what<font color="#E5E5E5"> what type of research</font>

321
00:13:37,379 --> 00:13:45,089
expenditure this person will spark<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it</font>

322
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:47,819
do as as a as a former corporate

323
00:13:45,089 --> 00:13:49,199
security person I found yet be like

324
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:51,599
without<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the government attacker you</font>

325
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,359
do you know what they want what they're

326
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,129
trying to get how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much if it they'll go</font>

327
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:59,339
to to get it with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

328
00:13:56,129 --> 00:14:01,910
dedicated<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hair or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> activist this is</font>

329
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:01,910
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> more nebulous</font>

330
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:08,550
so generally generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> I put this group</font>

331
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,650
into like you should just<font color="#E5E5E5"> not piss off</font>

332
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,760
people in<font color="#E5E5E5"> that last category but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

333
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:13,230
former category you may not have a

334
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,110
choice based on the type of work that

335
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:19,290
you're doing but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is all you know</font>

336
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:20,730
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a very business see transaction</font>

337
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:24,000
right like this isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> always how you</font>

338
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:25,760
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about security how</font>

339
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,930
efficient can we make these attacks

340
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:31,310
against our targets how much do they

341
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">cost for me soldier</font>

342
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,219
it's a fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea it performs a very</font>

343
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:44,090
specific function it won't solve all

344
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,800
your operational security worries so I

345
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:47,600
kind of want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish before I want</font>

346
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask questions and that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

347
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,550
thing but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font>

348
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,440
thinking basically it's one thing like

349
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:57,800
thinking not what your reverser II could

350
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:00,880
do rather know what they must do right

351
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,550
so sure you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can be freaked out about</font>

352
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:07,370
spice space aliens<font color="#CCCCCC"> drones baseband</font>

353
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:08,990
exploits robots from the future and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

354
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,550
sort of thing but if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

355
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:13,100
specifically about when you're trying to

356
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:19,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">protect that's that's a great place to</font>

357
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:21,890
stop um so yeah I hope that occasionally

358
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,510
the tools I give and the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like I</font>

359
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,610
come to you with<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems not solutions</font>

360
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:29,480
kind of things I've never really done

361
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:37,160
that today um so yeah if people have

362
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:38,660
questions I onion anyone I mean let me

363
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:41,140
shy because generally what happens when

364
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,760
i get these sorts of talks is that

365
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:45,500
people sit there silently and then I get

366
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:58,970
offstage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's like a line</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

367
00:15:45,500 --> 00:16:00,650
people who like<font color="#CCCCCC"> nowhere what but now</font>

368
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,750
what's happened is that that we will

369
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:05,510
start encrypting traffic right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

370
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:17,480
wondering is it possible<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get invented</font>

371
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:19,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the middle so it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the question</font>

372
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:23,180
you get to now I mean it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is under</font>

373
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:26,510
variable circumstances it becomes more

374
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:28,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">difficult and more expensive like once</font>

375
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,960
traffic is encrypted the<font color="#E5E5E5"> circumstances</font>

376
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:34,699
under which you can attempt to attack

377
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:36,530
that encrypted tunnel based<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a variety</font>

378
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,900
of environmental factors for instance

379
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:42,290
say you are watching youtube using a

380
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:44,449
chrome browser<font color="#E5E5E5"> google actor</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> youtube is a</font>

381
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:47,599
google property google also distributes

382
00:16:44,450 --> 00:16:48,800
chrome and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually know what their</font>

383
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:50,870
properties are supposed to

384
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,569
so functionally it should actually be

385
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:55,880
incredibly difficult to<font color="#CCCCCC"> attack better</font>

386
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:59,570
having<font color="#E5E5E5"> said that to use another example</font>

387
00:16:55,880 --> 00:17:02,450
if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are using you know browser X and</font>

388
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:05,199
looking at a random property online and

389
00:17:02,450 --> 00:17:09,589
your government actually had the

390
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,209
capability to coerce<font color="#E5E5E5"> so Mikey signing</font>

391
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:13,490
Authority for their countries or one of

392
00:17:11,209 --> 00:17:15,350
the political is of trust but<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

393
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:17,449
centralized model of encryption online

394
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:20,359
then it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> indeed possible that they</font>

395
00:17:17,449 --> 00:17:21,860
could read this encrypted traffic and so

396
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:23,540
I mean again<font color="#E5E5E5"> like encryption is in a</font>

397
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:25,849
universal panacea it's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

398
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:29,840
idea and you should definitely be using

399
00:17:25,849 --> 00:17:31,159
it um but yeah let's<font color="#CCCCCC"> see we can talk</font>

400
00:17:29,840 --> 00:18:00,470
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> off petition like that's</font>

401
00:17:31,160 --> 00:18:03,980
sort of like yes but yeah other other

402
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:06,919
people couldn't so so what the question

403
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:09,169
was a cricketer straight the question

404
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:12,530
was that this yeah it isn't there a move

405
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:14,809
yo away from storing things in the cloud

406
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:25,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things online and</font>

407
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">that sort of thing does that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I swoop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> um</font>

408
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think there's definitely</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot more</font>

409
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,660
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about things moving in that</font>

410
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:34,220
direction like I've done a few

411
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:36,200
journalists security conferences

412
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:38,090
recently where I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> had journalists say</font>

413
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,940
things like oh we need move back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

414
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:43,520
old school way right we we meet sources

415
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:46,309
dark and garage you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know probably</font>

416
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:48,320
wearing a trench coat and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the issue</font>

417
00:18:46,309 --> 00:18:50,418
I have with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I'm like right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

418
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:53,418
make sure you both drove there in a car

419
00:18:50,419 --> 00:18:55,460
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't have GPS writer and you let</font>

420
00:18:53,419 --> 00:19:01,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">your phones at home and your Fitbit and</font>

421
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:02,630
yeah you know um sorry it is this this

422
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,490
difficulty

423
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:05,960
try to roll that time obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

424
00:19:04,490 --> 00:19:08,360
and there's there's an experience to

425
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:10,370
online communication especially I mean

426
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:14,780
is meeting ass awesome person really

427
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:18,919
safer for them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source probably</font>

428
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:21,170
not but I mean did I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

429
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:23,810
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> a massive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and powerful</font>

430
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,920
international discussion about whether

431
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:27,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">or not we should be moving away of</font>

432
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:30,710
storing data clouds two countries have

433
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:33,860
local rock piles decentralization data

434
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:35,590
localization there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> even sort of panels</font>

435
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:37,939
and debates on this at this conference

436
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:39,050
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think I can bet that discussion is</font>

437
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:44,630
definitely occurring in a really

438
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:47,480
important way at a macro and is again a

439
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:51,470
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this boils down to convenience so</font>

440
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:53,300
I have a colleague with whom<font color="#E5E5E5"> partner in</font>

441
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:57,560
crime if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go with Myron many papers</font>

442
00:19:53,300 --> 00:20:00,230
on state spying and he he means my love

443
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:02,419
of Google logs he just<font color="#E5E5E5"> he just bubbles</font>

444
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:04,520
his mind<font color="#CCCCCC"> kateri writing stuff on site</font>

445
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:07,790
spying why are you writing is a google

446
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:11,240
doc it's just so convenient like<font color="#CCCCCC"> here in</font>

447
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">italy you got here but you want to send</font>

448
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:18,670
file it back and forth and tween us are

449
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:23,060
over to email what is this my god sorry

450
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:25,940
even even sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know i should</font>

451
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:28,840
be doing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this and so you know like</font>

452
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:32,150
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this that that friction between</font>

453
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,040
convenience and security that I think a

454
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:35,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of a lot of communities that have a</font>

455
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,070
very real reason they have these

456
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussions like this one obviously</font>

457
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,790
having those discussions right now well

458
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:42,980
maybe we shouldn't be doing this maybe

459
00:20:40,790 --> 00:20:44,420
we should be<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much yeah the</font>

460
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:47,090
alternative sucks or really want to use

461
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,950
the cloud on sets are basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> aiming</font>

462
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:54,110
this is the sort of guess we'll just

463
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:58,720
sort of going these days<font color="#CCCCCC"> color so what I</font>

464
00:20:54,110 --> 00:20:58,719
like this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sense of a cost model</font>

465
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:03,560
capitalism of libraries so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

466
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:05,540
wondering if you could actually sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

467
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:12,169
pre address three points within the

475
00:21:33,670 --> 00:21:39,290
what was it it was being the cost of

476
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:42,710
coercing a certificate authority to give

477
00:21:39,290 --> 00:21:45,649
you that's the type of key to play to

478
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:50,750
read in traffic or certain type of your

use of like we'll talk about base to<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

exposure to second for us so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

484
00:22:10,310 --> 00:22:14,179
this is a certain type of zero<font color="#CCCCCC"> debt</font>

00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,950
specialized type of zero-day exploit

486
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:18,410
right these are actually quite an

487
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:19,700
experience there's being significant

488

imagine into a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people thinking</font>

you're like baseband exploits<font color="#CCCCCC"> know quite</font>

you'll be targeted one because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> might</font>

509
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:13,950
be kind of interesting to the government

510
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:15,330
is highly unlikely like you would

511
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:18,000
probably definitely have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a person</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">of interest and so you notice these</font>

513
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,530
multiple policies on this the cost of

reversing a certificate authority inside

your country I mean again this

516
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:31,350
essentially speaks to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> plan to</font>

00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">essentially doing is you're all meeting</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">already your abilities to collect</font>

00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:42,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically free what you're trying to do</font>

523
00:23:40,410 --> 00:23:46,710
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I just read it all right so you</font>

524
00:23:42,570 --> 00:23:50,240
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to coerce people that hold keys if</font>

525
00:23:46,710 --> 00:23:52,080
they're inside your country then

526
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,060
disconnected you're relatively cheap

527
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:56,490
thing to do it can evolve a specific

528
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:59,070
type of threateningly document however

529
00:23:56,490 --> 00:24:02,610
reminders of all Jack Bauer depending on

530
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:04,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you actually operated something the</font>

531
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:06,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">costs can be different it can actually</font>

532
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:08,250
be incredibly cheap however if your

533
00:24:06,390 --> 00:24:10,530
country the person you're trying to

534
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:12,030
coerce is not inside your country<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

535
00:24:10,530 --> 00:24:13,440
what you do is now now you actually have

536
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:15,210
a situation like Mallory and is actually

537
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:17,960
happened where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Iranian government</font>

538
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,960
road

539
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:25,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we Google traffic that they were</font>

540
00:24:23,890 --> 00:24:27,190
interesting thing when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can scoop up</font>

541
00:24:25,390 --> 00:24:28,840
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google Facebook right now other</font>

542
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:31,000
people they were intercepting in country

543
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:32,500
does this one complex multi stage and at

544
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:36,790
that point it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually start to</font>

545
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:39,730
cost resource right um the final one is

546
00:24:36,790 --> 00:24:41,590
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are kind of killing the final one</font>

547
00:24:39,730 --> 00:24:44,110
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Columbus that are asking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

548
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:46,110
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> big flash player pop up that we saw</font>

549
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:48,520
now the interesting thing there is that

550
00:24:46,110 --> 00:24:50,229
it's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of a cheap way of</font>

551
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:51,900
carrying out a certain type of attack

552
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:54,520
and that's so this is this is mallorie

553
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,220
this is an active team must cost money

554
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">and in terms</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this rig right like you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">your most interesting people's</font>

trafficking and injecting things into it

557
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:08,760
however in this case you're actually

558
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:08,760
attempting to socially engineer the user

559
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,300
you

560
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:29,290
it will work even if people<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

561
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:31,600
trained not to be aware of these types

562
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:33,730
of things because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean everybody in</font>

563
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,020
this room cares about security some

564
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,060
extent which is why they're install

565
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,280
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably been given a lecture on</font>

566
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:42,639
not clicking on strange attachments and

567
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:45,760
unsolicited emails i got an e-mail or

568
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,780
hey you're awesome<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great so you</font>

569

<font color="#CCCCCC">get this talk such dad my clothing you</font>

570
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,600
know we've really like you to come to

571
00:25:51,310 --> 00:25:54,159
our conference and we're prepared to

00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:59,230
fee<font color="#CCCCCC"> and business class flights and we'll</font>

574
00:25:56,380 --> 00:26:02,800
put you up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> five star i finally</font>

575
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:04,540
recognition<font color="#CCCCCC"> any of it comes through your</font>

576
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,129
attendings actually click of a sort of

577
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:08,200
thing it's it's largely about

578
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:10,810
understanding the motivations type right

579
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:14,980
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that sense do you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> play on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

580
00:26:10,810 --> 00:26:18,970
sense of entitlement and a likelihood

581
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:20,980
that you know someone someone who does

582
00:26:18,970 --> 00:26:22,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">these conferences actually receives a</font>

583
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:25,600
lot of legitimate emails fighting the

584
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:28,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">conferences so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

585
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:34,570
thing does work is reasonably to perform

586
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:36,040
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a reward way obviously you know if</font>

587
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:40,120
that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're planning or</font>

588
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:41,080
compromising a specific individual you

589
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">know then it becomes more expensive</font>

590
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,290
because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start collecting</font>

591
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that individual like</font>

592
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:51,460
your success in this is based on large

593
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:54,399
about how welcoming type and so hoping

594
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,560
someone an adobe flash update is a

595
00:26:54,400 --> 00:27:01,060
pretty generic way of trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this</font>

596
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:02,620
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> i would describe it on the sort</font>

597
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:05,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the cheaper end of the spectrum i I</font>

598
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:08,409
think this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a reasonable</font>

599
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:13,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">suggestion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and someone with like I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

600
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:15,370
going to do that so yeah I'm mentor

601
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,629
answers your questions but if they see

602
00:27:15,370 --> 00:27:20,939
once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start getting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> infinite I said</font>

603
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:20,940
it does sort it's a blended landscape

604
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:10,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">why do you think the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's balanced</font>

605
00:28:06,899 --> 00:28:13,258
or twist and I sorry I see<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a</font>

606
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:15,059
two-part question right sir so one is it

607
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:16,379
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically like most of the</font>

608
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:18,389
government's in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Southeast Asian</font>

609
00:28:16,379 --> 00:28:19,860
context fit into a second tier at the

610
00:28:18,389 --> 00:28:24,629
sort of second-tier approach some tools

611
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:26,158
and the the second one was yes what do

612
00:28:24,629 --> 00:28:27,629
we see it as inevitable as normal

613
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:32,269
governments will also create bespoke

614
00:28:27,629 --> 00:28:35,250
tools for surveillance purposes and so

615
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:37,409
the first question is interesting like

616
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,850
we've certainly seen governments as

617
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:42,960
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> assets of Indonesia Malaysia</font>

618
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:44,809
Vietnam purchasing commercial

619
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,500
surveillance tools for all misdemeanors

620
00:28:44,809 --> 00:28:52,980
for these<font color="#CCCCCC"> years having said that Vietnam</font>

621
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:55,860
actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> a semantic security</font>

622
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:58,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">conference</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from ian's if they actually</font>

623
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:00,508
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple of different groups of</font>

624
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:02,460
sort of security researchers that are

625
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,440
reasonably high profile they have a

626
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:06,570
couple of antivirus companies they have

627
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:07,620
a gaming industry what will the sudden

628
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,200
if you actually start looking through

629
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,209
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> Microsoft advisories for Vietnamese</font>

630
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:14,279
researchers you'll actually see that

631
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:15,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's people developing high-end</font>

632
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:18,179
exploit and that sort of thing which so

633
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:20,360
it gets sold throughout the region so

634
00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:24,799
not not all the countries in this region

635
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:27,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily in the second tier right as</font>

636
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:29,250
to the cecum<font color="#CCCCCC"> christian like I I think</font>

637
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:32,700
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is an inevitability of and health</font>

638
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:33,899
tool development however that's actually

639
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:36,269
just because it becomes cheaper to

640
00:29:33,899 --> 00:29:39,620
develop these things<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I mean</font>

641
00:29:36,269 --> 00:29:39,620
originally the

642
00:29:40,429 --> 00:29:48,539
as as the popularity of these types of

643
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:49,799
tools increases sort of more tools with

644
00:29:48,539 --> 00:29:52,830
the creation<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these tools like you</font>

645
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,470
start being<font color="#E5E5E5"> creative right so a lot of</font>

646
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:57,000
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that used to be done manually and</font>

647
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:58,470
now we done in automatic fascism it

648
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:59,940
actually becomes cheaper for people to

649
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:01,740
actually start rolling out this type of

650
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:03,960
capability themselves so i think we'll

651
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:07,559
definitely see more of<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's just</font>

652
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:10,620
the the price point of like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bucci</font>

653
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:14,190
capability is starts driving down at a

654
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,408
time right so you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way</font>

655
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:18,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it might be at the rate at</font>

656
00:30:16,409 --> 00:30:20,789
which attacks that are considered<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

657
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:24,389
academic<font color="#E5E5E5"> or implemented so for instance</font>

658
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:28,289
a NSA maybe two or three<font color="#CCCCCC"> years ahead of</font>

659
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:30,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">Republic what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not whereas we take you</font>

660
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:33,990
know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other countries with less</font>

661
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,730
money fewer homes<font color="#E5E5E5"> I grad students or</font>

662
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:37,799
this type of thing the rate at which

663
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:39,539
they do implement theoretical academic

664
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:42,090
attacks might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually like five or</font>

665
00:30:39,539 --> 00:30:45,480
six years<font color="#E5E5E5"> after you know these these</font>

666
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:47,189
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> first become public so I</font>

667
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:49,470
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will probably space or a</font>

668
00:30:47,190 --> 00:30:52,830
static based on the resources of the

669
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:55,980
country however it is becoming cheaper

670
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:59,428
and cheaper to<font color="#CCCCCC"> write sort of thing in</font>

671
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:01,919
certain<font color="#E5E5E5"> areas so yeah I mean I think the</font>

672
00:30:59,429 --> 00:31:04,740
countries in the region will inevitably

673
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,429
be enhancing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their capabilities which is</font>

674
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:10,169
as better I guess an outcome of the

675
00:31:08,429 --> 00:31:12,059
Snowden revelations that I did<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

676
00:31:10,169 --> 00:31:14,460
initially anticipate which is it has

677
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:15,960
actually done a lot of great things for

678
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:18,539
people selling surveillance technology

679
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,090
because there's been looks like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA</font>

680
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">has all these toilets we need more</font>

681
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,080
budget we got to get some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this play</font>

682
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:26,428
come on<font color="#CCCCCC"> guys that's that's a real thing</font>

683
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:29,010
and that's been happens<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean I think</font>

684
00:31:26,429 --> 00:31:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they'll definitely be this sort of</font>

685
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:39,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">a difficult inimitable increase and</font>

686
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:39,260
desires<font color="#CCCCCC"> balance capabilities please</font>

687
00:31:39,970 --> 00:31:50,790
okay hi I'm busy first we'll be is still

688
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:54,899
releasing original recording based on

689
00:31:50,790 --> 00:31:57,820
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sony files are there steps that</font>

690
00:31:54,900 --> 00:32:03,430
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all he's hating as a news</font>

691
00:31:57,820 --> 00:32:05,830
organization that are unique to sort of

692
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:09,190
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> that responsibility of having</font>

693
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:12,399
those documents that people in this room

694
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:15,700
may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do or is it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just a</font>

00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:19,120
combination<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all deploying all the</font>

697
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:25,840
news organizations were not profit you

698
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,320
know it presented the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Gemalto story that</font>

699
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,840
came out recently with your<font color="#E5E5E5"> health and</font>

700
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,010
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically that these files are</font>

701
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:36,699
still there are still being discovered

702
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:38,500
and released so just curiously in from

703
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:41,790
that are there any lessons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Eagle</font>

704
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:46,420
group are necessary funded by the video

tape onto<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves that's that's</font>

706
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,970
that's a really good question I'm some

707
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:54,790
of it I'm not going to answer and like

708
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:57,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">so the question is kind of so-so my</font>

709
00:32:54,790 --> 00:33:00,129
organization is publishing and doing

710
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,169
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> reporting on the Snowden</font>

711
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:06,940
documents which which we<font color="#E5E5E5"> still releasing</font>

00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:09,910
more of he mentioned the<font color="#E5E5E5"> camel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toe tax</font>

713
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:12,790
story recently even and this was when it

714
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:15,460
was shown<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the NSA and gchq</font>

compromised the world's largest<font color="#E5E5E5"> sim card</font>

716
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:21,220
manufacturer in order to just steal the

717
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,200
keys sim cards which the room yo greatly

718
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:26,620
enhances their their cellular

719
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,750
surveillance capabilities and so his

720
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:32,439
question was you know have<font color="#CCCCCC"> we done</font>

721
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:33,700
anything special in order to yeah

722
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,990
because because there's obviously so

723
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:38,080
much<font color="#E5E5E5"> sensitivity around some the</font>

724
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:40,570
documents<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hold so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought I mean</font>

725
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:42,669
you know what what advice can I give to

726
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:45,639
sort of other organizations human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

727
00:33:42,670 --> 00:33:49,120
of journalism<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this research</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

728
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:50,980
reporting on so now just here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we've</font>

729
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,350
definitely definitely been a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

730
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,450
specialized<font color="#E5E5E5"> in deep</font>

731
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:57,659
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did not at first of all</font>

732
00:33:54,450 --> 00:34:01,440
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> would hope sort of otherwise maybe my</font>

733
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:04,200
job is giving tours from experian but

734
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,690
but yeah the we actually have a security

735
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,000
team at first look and then actually

736
00:34:06,690 --> 00:34:10,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">enables you I mean security is not</font>

737
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:12,929
surgery is not about tools rights

738
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:16,500
curious about procedures and

739
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:19,500
infrastructure and you know software and

740
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,570
two chains and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a variety of</font>

741
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,239
things and so I this actually sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

742
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:26,550
gets in many ways to the heart both of

743
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:28,500
what I was trying to do here that I

744
00:34:26,550 --> 00:34:30,570
actually feel that this community does

745
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:33,210
have a very tool based approach to

746
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:36,030
security right which i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think is because</font>

747
00:34:33,210 --> 00:34:38,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">it means that you don't sort of obviates</font>

748
00:34:36,030 --> 00:34:39,570
the need to have specialized resource

749
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,118
right which<font color="#CCCCCC"> which I think we're very</font>

750
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:44,190
uncomfortable recommending that we need

751
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,580
so what we're doing it first livers we

752
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:49,200
actually have security engineers not not

753
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">people who have kind of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interest in</font>

754
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:52,560
security but actually a background in

755
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:56,549
human rights but they learn how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to use</font>

756
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,930
p2p like no like I mean I<font color="#E5E5E5"> spent five</font>

757
00:34:56,550 --> 00:34:59,250
years breaking into computers for money

758
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:00,990
and I spent six years on the Google

759
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:04,950
school we had actual story engineer

760
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:07,200
strike and and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

761
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,210
would love to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see more organizations</font>

762
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,919
that money and resource to that which is

763
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of an ugly thing to say us what we</font>

764
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:14,100
really want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hear is that the open</font>

765
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:16,080
source community should write a few more

766
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:17,150
schools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they sneak a better you eggs</font>

767
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:23,310
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything's going to be great</font>

768
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:27,330
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not sure and so I mean I</font>

769
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:29,880
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and if I wanted to be cynical</font>

770
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:33,299
I could say that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably easier</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

771
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,859
get two hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dollars to pay</font>

772
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:36,359
for a conference and fly a bunch of

773
00:35:34,859 --> 00:35:38,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and to really have a discussion</font>

774
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:40,619
about security than it is to pay for

775
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:45,300
security software if I was being really

776
00:35:40,619 --> 00:35:47,220
cynical but everyone so um so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I</font>

777
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:48,869
might think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that organizations need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

778
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,029
do is is sure I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a</font>

779
00:35:48,869 --> 00:35:54,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of value of education so I mean</font>

780
00:35:51,030 --> 00:35:58,050
internally at first look we have all of

781
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,399
our internal email is pgp encrypted OTR

782
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,220
is the department<font color="#CCCCCC"> that everyone shares</font>

783
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:03,470
all of our phone calls

784
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:04,819
by using signal we also do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot more</font>

785
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:06,799
stuff that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really necessarily</font>

786
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:10,820
recommend that<font color="#E5E5E5"> organizations do without</font>

787
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,920
dedicated security resource now that's

788
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,560
that's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> available to some groups for</font>

789
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:18,170
sure it is available<font color="#E5E5E5"> to others for</font>

790
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:20,779
instance I<font color="#CCCCCC"> have been fighting this fight</font>

791
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:23,570
with regard to news organizations and

792
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:26,180
that many many news organizations do not

793
00:36:23,570 --> 00:36:28,310
have dedicated security resource and yet

794
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:30,080
they owned by conde nast or Rupert

795
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,520
Murdoch or you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and these are</font>

796
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,319
actually giant international

797
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,300
conglomerates that that could be doing a

798
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:36,800
lot more particular users so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

799
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:38,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">some ways it involves like a perspective</font>

800
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:41,000
shift on how we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see security</font>

801
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:45,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">rather than you know security</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is using</font>

802
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:47,450
for but but how that's done in a

803
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,009
cost-effective matters is<font color="#E5E5E5"> differently</font>

804
00:36:47,450 --> 00:37:12,910
challenging please and thanks for the

805
00:36:52,010 --> 00:37:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">talk getting small organization based in</font>

806
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:29,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">fresh and to understand the way to my</font>

807
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,060
consciousness<font color="#CCCCCC"> in Syria and do you have</font>

808
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:34,480
any interest in 22 yeah thanks to

809
00:37:32,060 --> 00:37:41,630
understand the risk and start looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

810
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">constitutions right oh and my did admit</font>

811
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:46,580
to being the kind of person<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

812
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:50,960
everything um so that the question was

813
00:37:46,580 --> 00:37:53,330
you know what you say to organizations

814
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:55,490
that are working and probably comparably

815
00:37:53,330 --> 00:37:57,140
safe geographic location say you know

816
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:59,930
the UK or you risk something and they're

817
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:01,430
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> with groups in potential hot</font>

818
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:03,169
spots like Syria and that sort of thing

819
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:05,330
I'm how do you convince these groups

820
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:07,310
that yeah sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is is really</font>

821
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:10,848
important without<font color="#E5E5E5"> sounding like paranoid</font>

822
00:38:07,310 --> 00:38:13,009
not um<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like I think this this</font>

823
00:38:10,849 --> 00:38:13,380
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is you know really sort of hints</font>

824
00:38:13,010 --> 00:38:15,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">than they</font>

825
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:18,720
did I think a lot but for this community

826
00:38:15,270 --> 00:38:21,690
I actually had a very visceral

827
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">real-world example this way I was giving</font>

828
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:25,800
a talk a little bit like this one but

829
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:27,689
actually a lot more focused on actually

830
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,770
the nuts and bolts of malware of

831
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,600
government spying and how it actually

832
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:32,840
works and I had gentle and what got to

833
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:37,920
me out of the tool<font color="#CCCCCC"> and he said that</font>

834
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:40,320
happens to me what happened was like

835
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:42,300
yeah so I got this email and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

836
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,810
apparently about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rights report</font>

837
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,730
on china and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I opened it and</font>

838
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,320
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> liked it it was just like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

839
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,820
document was blank and nothing happened

840
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:52,710
and then I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ignored it but I'm</font>

841
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:55,350
thinking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I have a look at I</font>

842
00:38:52,710 --> 00:38:57,420
was like wow this is actually Chinese

843
00:38:55,350 --> 00:39:02,160
government now<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like you you're you</font>

844
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:05,940
will do and it turned out that he was he

845
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,560
was a loyal and true to prosecuting

846
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:09,600
human rights abuses will try trying to

847
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:12,120
do so I was actually sent his belly way

848
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:15,330
he was actually be really concerned that

849
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:18,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">this attacker just look huh what is that</font>

850
00:39:15,330 --> 00:39:21,240
baby my god this is this kind of thing

851
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:26,160
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> you seem very very relaxed about</font>

852
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,109
this um and and actually in order to get

853
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,779
through them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was like as a lawyer</font>

854
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:32,550
would you not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> be furious if you</font>

855
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,880
found out the Chinese government had

856
00:39:32,550 --> 00:39:37,950
sent spies to your office physically to

857
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:41,820
break in and then go through your filing

858
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:46,279
cabinet look you outrageous that's

859
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:48,390
exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's happening wait you know</font>

860
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:50,610
so I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> like even even actually</font>

861
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:53,490
explains what the significance of being

862
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:56,820
targeted in this minute is can actually

863
00:39:53,490 --> 00:40:00,799
be challenging um and I think I mean for

864
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:04,610
protecting sources or you know people

865
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,810
particular people are supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help</font>

866
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:13,770
this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting problem</font>

867
00:40:08,810 --> 00:40:16,049
especially in areas where operational

868
00:40:13,770 --> 00:40:18,230
security<font color="#E5E5E5"> failures on your part might</font>

869
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:21,690
have drastic consequences on<font color="#CCCCCC"> their end I</font>

870
00:40:18,230 --> 00:40:25,740
think we're getting better at that as a

871
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:29,880
as a community<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I really do</font>

872
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,799
I mean I thought that this is probably

873
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:34,050
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of practical examples I</font>

874
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,880
think I think staying<font color="#E5E5E5"> away from from</font>

875
00:40:34,050 --> 00:40:39,000
freezer phone mentality is really

876
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:41,220
important because it's it's nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

877
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:43,770
just makes you sound paranoid it's also

878
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:46,500
kind of paralyzing because then people

879
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:48,420
like oh I'd love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do something but I</font>

880
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:51,030
heard that the NSA has actually put

881
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:52,920
implants in all of my pets friends so

882
00:40:51,030 --> 00:40:57,330
like what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really do at this stage</font>

883
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:59,310
like I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> notice right the</font>

884
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:04,020
the way I could try to do this is to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

885
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:05,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">people to like to I guess judge how much</font>

886
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:07,590
security willingness I think

887
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:09,630
organization or a group of people<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

888
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:12,090
and then try to pitch to that rotten

889
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:15,210
like I am going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to drag these people</font>

890
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,580
kicking and screaming through all of us

891
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:20,100
like well maybe what I can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> is we go</font>

892
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,810
and like well you guys are all in

893
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:24,240
Palestine and you drive through Israeli

894
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:26,369
checkpoints constantly have you thought

895
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:28,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">about just encrypting your computers and</font>

896
00:41:26,369 --> 00:41:30,390
products<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like a</font>

897
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:31,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">one-day one offset I mean so i guess</font>

898
00:41:30,390 --> 00:41:33,089
like sort of picking the security

899
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:34,770
willingness of the organization will try

900
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:39,900
to pitch what you think you can get done

901
00:41:34,770 --> 00:41:42,660
it's probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great first day anyway</font>

902
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:47,520
yes this is an atmosphere true with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

913
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,600
to cheat is is a very specialized tool

914
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:23,880
for doing a very specialized thing the

920
00:42:39,829 --> 00:42:43,640
a tool you simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to know what</font>

921
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:46,759
using it actually means and it's just

922
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:49,700
here at this specific moment in time

923
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:53,059
that your computer is not infected by

924
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:54,529
these two specific strains of lawful

925

intercept malware that are used by

926
00:42:54,529 --> 00:42:57,559
governments that doesn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

927

fine it doesn't say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you will be</font>

two<font color="#CCCCCC"> very specific diseases right now so</font>

931
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:11,299
you're like well I went<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this country</font>

932
00:43:07,309 --> 00:43:13,430
do I have west nile virus you don't so

933
00:43:11,299 --> 00:43:15,380
something like I think I think using to

934
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:17,710
take is very useful if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

935
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:20,750
specific wiring and I think that that's

936
00:43:17,710 --> 00:43:22,940
good knowing knowing why you're using

937
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,160
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools you can usually supported I</font>

938
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:28,880
think is sort of something I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

939
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:30,230
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to emphasize your hands for so</font>

940
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,520
you having detectives is useful for

941
00:43:30,230 --> 00:43:34,220
checking for that specific types of

942
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,230
malware I don't know the tools that i

943
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:38,569
recommend I mean to be honest I'm not

944
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:40,510
sure I<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommend any any tools that</font>

945
00:43:38,569 --> 00:43:42,980
aren't already being recommended by the

946
00:43:40,510 --> 00:43:46,700
meanies with capable digital security

947
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:48,380
trainers in this place because<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously</font>

948
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:50,538
when you're deciding to recommend a tool

949
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:54,440
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> this sort of balance of you know</font>

950
00:43:50,539 --> 00:43:57,380
what is it dude vs. how hard is it to

951
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:59,539
use our way you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is one that I</font>

952
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:01,430
really like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I try to get everyone's ears</font>

953
00:43:59,539 --> 00:44:04,309
as if I<font color="#CCCCCC"> can't do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so my phone actually</font>

954
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:11,450
and and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i love it specifically</font>

955
00:44:04,309 --> 00:44:14,180
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's great so it has the best</font>

956
00:44:11,450 --> 00:44:17,930
user interface any security product<font color="#E5E5E5"> i've</font>

957
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:31,009
ever seen this you can see my phone<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

958
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:33,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">currently off right the hips buns oh my</font>

959
00:44:31,010 --> 00:44:34,849
god it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's what we pay I've run out</font>

960
00:44:33,109 --> 00:44:37,700
with my subscription basically what this

961
00:44:34,849 --> 00:44:39,559
is this is a VPN software and it has one

962
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,430
button and the button does on and off

963
00:44:39,559 --> 00:44:45,140
which is freaking fantastic so so I

964
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,509
actually you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people like oh</font>

965
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:48,750
you should use the VPN that's that's

966
00:44:47,510 --> 00:44:50,460
actually great out here and a BP

967
00:44:48,750 --> 00:44:52,740
is an encrypted tunnel so say you don't

968
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust the Wi-Fi and the hotel or airport</font>

969
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:57,180
or wherever else or stain you can use

970
00:44:55,380 --> 00:44:58,410
this virtual private tunnel which will

971
00:44:57,180 --> 00:45:00,930
tunnel you out somewhere on the internet

972
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:04,950
matter that's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea and you should</font>

973
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:06,690
use these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things this I getting people</font>

974
00:45:04,950 --> 00:45:09,439
to set them up and configure them<font color="#E5E5E5"> etc it</font>

975
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:12,180
has historically been an awful drag I

976
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,520
don't like<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it on a phone this was</font>

977
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:17,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">also because you have an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on/off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> button</font>

978
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:21,210
and it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes um the downside is it</font>

979
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:25,470
does cost to all of which<font color="#CCCCCC"> i discover i</font>

980
00:45:21,210 --> 00:45:27,090
have just what but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually think</font>

981
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:29,609
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually not a bad price like</font>

982
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:32,370
this is cool freedom freedom within a

983
00:45:29,610 --> 00:45:33,510
young agent so freedom um so yeah I was

984
00:45:32,370 --> 00:45:35,609
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to say like in terms of a tool</font>

985
00:45:33,510 --> 00:45:37,770
that I actually don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel I know the</font>

986
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:42,810
guys that wrote it as well you know but

987
00:45:37,770 --> 00:45:44,940
they're pretty sane so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I guess</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

988
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:47,850
am duly disinclined to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recommit tools</font>

989
00:45:44,940 --> 00:46:14,880
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that's not a bad one as this</font>

990
00:45:47,850 --> 00:46:16,470
comber<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so given that that's</font>

991
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:20,580
that's a really it's a really tough

992
00:46:16,470 --> 00:46:22,049
problem right because is there any way

993
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:24,060
to secure a smartphone like the

994
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:28,260
difficulties that you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have much</font>

995
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:30,210
control over your force I mean in some

996
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,660
ways<font color="#E5E5E5"> Linux is infinitely securable which</font>

997
00:46:30,210 --> 00:46:36,600
is infinitely<font color="#E5E5E5"> tin horrible that's not</font>

998
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:39,629
necessarily great as anyone from this

999
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:42,569
real preserve a<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term linux user</font>

1001
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:49,430
with your linux box and the value so
