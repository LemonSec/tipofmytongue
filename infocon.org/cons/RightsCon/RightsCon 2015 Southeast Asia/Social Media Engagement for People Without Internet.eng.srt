we talk about the particular region

219
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:34,630
let's say Southeast Asia we see that

220
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:36,850
internet is approximately thirty to

221
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:41,589
thirty-five percent people can access

226
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:56,050
is up to 110 percent and that is perhaps

227
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:58,449
due to some people are using the

228
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:01,750

00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:09,230
yes undoubtedly<font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile phone penetrate</font>

world well now coming to the bubbly up

239
00:11:36,050 --> 00:11:39,680
because these are the common facts we

240
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:42,680
all know knowing me has already

241
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,430
expressed all the facts to you bubble

243
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:49,910
especially in the emerging markets<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

244
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,310
South Asia particularly where the

245
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:54,319
internet penetration is lowest across

246
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,839
the globe it's only nineteen percent

247
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,880
here thirty<font color="#E5E5E5"> thirty-five percent in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

248
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:01,310
Southeast Asia but if you see the

249
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,060
population so here the corporation is

250
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:07,209
almost half of the world's population

251
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:11,719
with such a little penetration of the

252
00:12:07,209 --> 00:12:14,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">information or information age so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

253
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:18,279
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emerged the idea of a bubbly</font>

254
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:22,310
so that people can<font color="#CCCCCC"> use the social media</font>

255
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:26,649
even without<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet so what we did</font>

256
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:29,329
is that we integrated the social media

257
00:12:26,649 --> 00:12:31,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">the voice blogging services with the</font>

261
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:45,769
people can just<font color="#E5E5E5"> dial L and they can</font>

00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:49,459
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> some information about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top</font>

263
00:12:45,769 --> 00:12:52,310
celebrities or about<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer so we</font>

264
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:54,109
are having major two categories here one

265
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:57,109
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the celebrities where the</font>

266
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:59,480
people can access the celebrities

267
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,329
something like mom<font color="#CCCCCC"> bloggers which is</font>

268
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:05,870
knowing me will beat that is Jane so

269
00:13:02,329 --> 00:13:08,839
they are some of our premium content

270
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:12,440
providers in Philippine so similarly we

271
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,610
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> more than</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 of premium bloggers</font>

00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:20,130
updating the blog and

274
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:23,069
the sharing the information with your

276
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:28,699
anything it can be about the information

277
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:31,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">just pure information about the Neos</font>

entertainment by some artists famous

281
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:43,290

00:13:40,470 --> 00:13:45,089
also have<font color="#CCCCCC"> peer-to-peer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so because people</font>

283

dialing a shortcode if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using a</font>

00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:02,189
about about the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example in</font>

the small kids they had to go to

316
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:36,230
spoon as the routine but other channels

317
00:15:33,089 --> 00:15:39,720
could not of course it takes time to

318
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:41,610
broadcast information to disseminate the

319
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:45,509
information using the official channels

320
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:47,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">but somehow some school principals and</font>

Vietnam is cool vietnam in Japan they

332
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:24,540

they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because it</font>

platform for practicing their voice blog

336

<font color="#CCCCCC">platform is not meant as an educational</font>

351
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:24,029
tool but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean users are the one who</font>

352
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:27,020
know how to actually exploit a platform

353
00:17:24,029 --> 00:17:31,169
of how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually utilize the platform</font>

354
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:34,830
presently we are also working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

355
00:17:31,169 --> 00:17:38,159
Indonesian NGO and P are trying to use

00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:40,918
<font color="#E5E5E5">the public as a platform to disseminate</font>

manage

359
00:17:41,690 --> 00:17:48,139
because there are also it that region is

360
00:17:44,809 --> 00:17:52,250
also very prone to the disasters so

361
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:56,149
friends this is how we are trying to

362
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:59,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">help the citizens in fact could not be</font>

363
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:02,508
the platform is designed in such a way

364
00:17:59,029 --> 00:18:05,149
which is so interoperable that with a

365
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:07,580
single sign on the smartphone user

375
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:43,850
will certainly discuss on 121 during

376
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:46,429
that session over to the next I'm Rick

377
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:51,769
mahadji from the computer professionals

378
00:18:46,429 --> 00:18:54,789
Union CPU is a group of computer

379
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:57,919
professionals some technical people

380
00:18:54,789 --> 00:18:59,929
united into bringing technology to the

381
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,240
people so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> deploy different kind of</font>

382
00:18:59,929 --> 00:19:04,759
technology for nonprofits and other

00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,240
capsules communities this<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:11,000
project is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a an app that you</font>

385
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:13,340
can download them in dengeki g's if it's

386
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:15,889
a combination of various open source

387
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:18,830
tools created by other people and then

388
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:21,740
we thought of combining them and then

389
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:24,580
offering that<font color="#E5E5E5"> platform to the grassroots</font>

390
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">or in a particular this particular</font>

391
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:29,840
implementation is for what they called

00:19:28,070 --> 00:19:32,178
<font color="#E5E5E5">both report</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> TV if you're familiar with</font>

00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,090
both report avia and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kenya desert up</font>

394
00:19:32,179 --> 00:19:39,440
those are the<font color="#CCCCCC"> first election monitoring</font>

395
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:41,658
platform or efforts created using<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

396
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,250
tools so we replicated it in the

397
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:48,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">philippines in 2010 and dependable team</font>

398
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:51,980
what is different for both the four th

399
00:19:48,139 --> 00:19:55,540
us what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing with cpu is always</font>

400
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:58,130
people class tools is that you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

401
00:19:55,540 --> 00:20:00,590
given the tool you go to the community

402
00:19:58,130 --> 00:20:02,630
first know what their problems are and

403
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,550
then you try to find tools that could

404
00:20:02,630 --> 00:20:09,140
help<font color="#CCCCCC"> them so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way we do things</font>

405
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:11,540
with which cpu so why is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> important to</font>

406
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,080
monitor the elections I don't know if

407
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:18,710
how many of you came from a country that

408
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:25,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">is using automated elections is there</font>

409
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:28,220
anyone so why<font color="#E5E5E5"> India so most of us are</font>

410
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:31,129
using a how the election on the mind

411
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:34,880
well born<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so we have reasons</font>

412
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:37,550
for doing that one elections is

413
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:40,070
supposedly the most basic part of

414
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:44,419
democracy<font color="#CCCCCC"> where you ensure the people</font>

415
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:46,310
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> can both say quickly and then there</font>

416
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:48,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a public hunting of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the boats and</font>

417
00:20:46,310 --> 00:20:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">then the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you do</font>

418
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:52,580
automated elections you encounter lots

419
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,970
of problems it's it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be to</font>

420
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,169
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the basic principles so it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

421
00:20:55,970 --> 00:21:03,050
important to monitor the elections and

422
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:08,060
so to help grassroots this is what we

423
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:11,270
reuse first we the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> started a</font>

424
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:14,060
year before<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> elections</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on that</font>

425
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:15,889
preparations what we did is educate the

426
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,990
people on what is the ultimate in the

427
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:21,170
election<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then how to use the</font>

428
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:23,540
machines and then we created checklists

429
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:26,480
or in they could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow those</font>

430
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:27,740
checklists and then those are written

431
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,050
under check please those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font>

432
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can report on Election Day so</font>

433
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:38,870
it's a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> effort before the actual</font>

434
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:40,760
monetary begins and then while we're

435
00:21:38,870 --> 00:21:44,030
doing the trainings so that's for about

436
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:50,110
a year we also developing the platform

437
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:55,639
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically these tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> smsc also from</font>

438
00:21:50,110 --> 00:21:58,850
OSHA BB and then back then frontline SMS

439
00:21:55,640 --> 00:22:01,400
we also use primary SMS with smc and

440
00:21:58,850 --> 00:22:04,340
then bucktail frontline<font color="#E5E5E5"> and most SMS if</font>

441
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:07,370
we feel that it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that friendly yet</font>

442
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:09,470
for administrators so what we get is

443
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:11,959
recreated is some simple

444
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:14,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">really the texts are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all consolidated</font>

445
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,960
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> some little programming so</font>

446
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:19,820
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the tools and then we have</font>

447
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:23,890
this this this project basically uses

448
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:26,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">SMS so we have those tools on the on the</font>

449
00:22:23,890 --> 00:22:31,100
headquarters and then we propagated this

450
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:34,010
numbers to the volunteers so that's

451
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:37,219
where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-year preparation on</font>

452
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,490
education comes in you you are able to

453
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:42,020
propagate these numbers for about a year

454
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:46,520
so we partner with other organizations

455
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:49,549
so this one<font color="#E5E5E5"> sponsored aya and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> then we</font>

456
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:51,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">have our own number and then this these</font>

457
00:22:49,549 --> 00:22:55,629
numbers are all consolidated on that

458
00:22:51,890 --> 00:23:01,789
platform during election day we have

459
00:22:55,630 --> 00:23:05,559
volunteers<font color="#E5E5E5"> these volunteers because and</font>

460
00:23:01,789 --> 00:23:09,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">only then our first lesson is we try to</font>

461
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:11,658
implement some some keywords very like

462
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:14,990
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're texting about if you're</font>

463
00:23:11,659 --> 00:23:17,990
reporting about a particular anomalous

464
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:20,600
or or or fraudulent activity during

465
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:23,240
election you use some<font color="#E5E5E5"> keywords and then</font>

466
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:26,990
it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> consolidate it but on that</font>

467
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,559
experience most most volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> or since</font>

468
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:33,380
they are basic massive<font color="#E5E5E5"> some in essence a</font>

469
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,539
workers they are not able to like

470
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:38,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">memorize on the short coats all the</font>

471
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:40,610
keywords so it limits the reports that

472
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:42,590
we got so what we did for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the 2013</font>

473
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,379
election we just told them this is the

474
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:48,379
number report whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see on the</font>

475
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:52,400
checklist no keywords no no no kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

476
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:57,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">pre according to so yesterday for you so</font>

477
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:59,840
that's why when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that you get not</font>

478
00:23:57,590 --> 00:24:03,020
get reports that are not really<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody</font>

479
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:06,289
for God for the election so you can

480
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:08,750
request asking for load credits<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

481
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:11,240
can you send me five pesos and then

482
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,990
potentially for you get lots of that

483
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:18,620
stuff or say hello how are you how so

484
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:20,390
the machine is since the the the one

485
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:23,389
receiving the reports are is a machine

486
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:25,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">for an answer so they'll try to if</font>

487
00:24:23,389 --> 00:24:27,079
if one volunteer<font color="#E5E5E5"> sense are reported it</font>

488
00:24:25,639 --> 00:24:28,428
to the type could get a feedback from

489
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:30,739
the machine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then during the laning</font>

490
00:24:28,429 --> 00:24:32,299
road we<font color="#E5E5E5"> already told them the machine</font>

491
00:24:30,739 --> 00:24:34,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">will look answer it will just received a</font>

492
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,869
report and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then just assume that very</font>

493
00:24:34,009 --> 00:24:38,059
point was already received don't ask

494
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:40,428
anything on the machine but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you still</font>

495
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:44,719
get lots of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those stuff so that's why we</font>

496
00:24:40,429 --> 00:24:47,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a team of volunteers working in</font>

497
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:49,969
three shifts because in the Philippines

498
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:52,129
the elections for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pins on</font>

499
00:24:49,969 --> 00:24:55,190
main and then it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> have like two to</font>

500
00:24:52,129 --> 00:24:58,879
three days of counting to get our

501
00:24:55,190 --> 00:25:00,200
results one particular one particular

502
00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:02,809
deity of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Philippine election is that</font>

503
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:06,169
we do not<font color="#E5E5E5"> both for like or the case of</font>

504
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">India on this day on this month they'll</font>

505
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:09,950
both for a certain position and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

506
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:12,708
<font color="#E5E5E5">quarter they'll both for another</font>

507
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:15,919
position in here we do it all in a day

508
00:25:12,709 --> 00:25:19,339
we both for president senators mayors

509
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,200
and whatever count on the proceeds get

510
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:24,079
summarized on the town<font color="#E5E5E5"> level and the</font>

511
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:29,749
provincial level in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the national level</font>

512
00:25:24,079 --> 00:25:35,719
so it's kind of a messy election<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean</font>

513
00:25:29,749 --> 00:25:38,829
under the flow of those data so during

514
00:25:35,719 --> 00:25:41,359
those trainings we were able to to

515
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:43,519
encourage some because what we did is

516
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:47,269
before the election day we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

517
00:25:43,519 --> 00:25:50,839
printed some IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we got some support</font>

518
00:25:47,269 --> 00:25:53,239
from different personalities or groups

519
00:25:50,839 --> 00:25:56,809
we printed some IDs and we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

520
00:25:53,239 --> 00:25:58,429
give out some 38,000 volunteer IDs<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

521
00:25:56,809 --> 00:26:02,269
that's like 30 thousand volunteers

522
00:25:58,429 --> 00:26:04,009
during an actual baby we have 90

523
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,599
provinces in the Philippines so we

524
00:26:04,009 --> 00:26:08,149
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have one of this</font>

525
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:11,049
coordinator / / / problems at<font color="#E5E5E5"> Birth down</font>

526
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:14,178
and then we have listened pepper

527
00:26:11,049 --> 00:26:16,940
volunteers so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is this volume is</font>

528
00:26:14,179 --> 00:26:19,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">the regulation day after they both have</font>

529
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:20,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">texteo</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they stay there or like one or</font>

530
00:26:19,219 --> 00:26:23,329
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> days and then record whatever</font>

531
00:26:20,619 --> 00:26:25,820
anomalies or frauds that they will seek

532
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:30,950
are using those numbers so these are

533
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:33,950
interesting things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we found out by</font>

534
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:37,210
the way for<font color="#CCCCCC"> forgots volunteers on the</font>

535
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:41,600
headquarters which are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> in two</font>

536
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:44,060
we ensure that owned up on a particular

537
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,010
batch of volunteers there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> wind up</font>

538
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:50,570
lost long ago because in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippines</font>

539
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:52,550
we have lots of dialects so while we are

540
00:26:50,570 --> 00:26:54,409
we can understand English in Tagalog in

541
00:26:52,550 --> 00:26:56,300
the in the headquarters<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have</font>

542
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:58,250
reporters in Mindanao that will say we

543
00:26:56,300 --> 00:27:00,830
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> report in this ayah and then we</font>

544
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:03,050
have reporters in northern part that we

545
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:05,659
recorded<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> O'Conner so you have to have</font>

546
00:27:03,050 --> 00:27:07,790
a volunteer at least knows how to

547
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:10,670
translate those dialects or languages

548
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:13,730
into a gallop or English so that's why

549
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:16,130
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have like a filtering team the</font>

550
00:27:13,730 --> 00:27:18,980
filters all really but reports in at the

551
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:23,000
same time those that team also translate

552
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:28,190
those SMS reports so for particular

553
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:31,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">penetrate election we clean some a</font>

554
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:35,300
thousand and<font color="#E5E5E5"> fifty data data points from</font>

555
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:36,890
around 5,000 reports of the gap so we

556
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:39,830
have like four thousand garbage to work

557
00:27:36,890 --> 00:27:42,470
and if you get a thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant</font>

558
00:27:39,830 --> 00:27:44,629
reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then from the 30,000 to</font>

559
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,760
expect you're expecting to report

560
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:49,970
because you came about 30,000 IDs they

561
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:51,710
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5,000 well well that's</font>

562
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:56,060
that's how that's the series of the ham

563
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:58,910
so or the 29 report that then the 1,000

564
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:01,310
reports that we have we broken it down

565
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:05,270
into different categories so we have

566
00:28:01,310 --> 00:28:07,490
reports<font color="#E5E5E5"> more on because errors because</font>

567
00:28:05,270 --> 00:28:09,770
the machine has because<font color="#CCCCCC"> fish and hunting</font>

568
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:11,810
optical scanner machine so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

569
00:28:09,770 --> 00:28:15,050
machine<font color="#E5E5E5"> being used to read elections and</font>

570
00:28:11,810 --> 00:28:19,159
then we have various rejected ballots

571
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:20,540
this stuff so during the liturgy

572
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:24,290
allegedly sit when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> found out that</font>

573
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:27,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">there is a widespread malfunction or</font>

574
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:31,639
machines breaking down forty-six percent

575
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:34,790
and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> comelec during the first</font>

576
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:38,690
day safety that there is only there are

577
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:41,000
only two hundred machines that fail but

578
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:43,220
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> on our own monitoring based on the</font>

579
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,910
volunteers of the gap there is equal

580
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:50,070
numbers of 266 machines 266 machines

581
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,650
would be equal to

582
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,629
twenty-six thousand voters not be there

583
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:58,120
goes<font color="#E5E5E5"> that being</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> counted so these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the</font>

584
00:28:55,630 --> 00:29:02,650
sample reports that we SMS recursively

585
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:05,860
gap like for this one it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the</font>

586
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:09,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">machine is just drinking some yellow</font>

587
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:14,280
life and then comes out and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then another</font>

588
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:17,020
report saying a point 44p here the

589
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:20,560
machine will never accept ballot but so

590
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:22,629
some paper jams<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening and then we</font>

591
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:26,500
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> reports on a quad transmission</font>

592
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:29,410
problems since those are not the reports

593
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:35,200
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> present devil are sent to white</font>

594
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:39,760
wine through gsm so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are areas or</font>

595
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:43,750
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> telco network is not that good so you</font>

have requested<font color="#E5E5E5"> being received on the</font>

597
00:29:43,750 --> 00:29:51,730
higher levels so for supper particular

598
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:54,879
case we have some certain problems with

599
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:57,670
a lots of failures so it effectively the

600
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:59,980
whole national county delay the whole

601
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:01,840

634
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:50,159
to conclude this whole project is<font color="#E5E5E5"> easily</font>

635
00:31:46,649 --> 00:31:52,770
not really its combination of getting

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage and then providing them</font>

637
00:31:52,770 --> 00:31:57,120
the most simple tool that they could do

638
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:58,620
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can use for that or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whatever</font>

information to them in the simplest way

662

possible so besides just SMS it gives

breakfast SMS text for also the tool

00:33:34,290 --> 00:33:41,610
called tobacco which gave mobile cash

673
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:46,679

00:33:51,990 --> 00:33:56,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the program they wanted to do a or</font>

678
00:33:54,090 --> 00:33:58,919
they did do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> one-time financial</font>

679
00:33:56,340 --> 00:34:02,040
literacy training with the recipients<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

680
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:04,680
the cash transfers but they also wanted

681
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:06,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do ongoing training using mobile</font>

682
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:08,670
phones and do quizzes to find out

683
00:34:06,750 --> 00:34:11,250
whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the recipients understood</font>

684
00:34:08,670 --> 00:34:13,740
the trainings so they use engage spark

685
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:18,480
to send them old messages and receive

686
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:21,089
answers from a quest so they are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

687
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:22,800
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back to that one so they modeled</font>

688
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:24,300
their stories after a very important

689
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,050
form of media here in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philippines</font>

690
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,330
which is soap operas they wrote nearly

691
00:34:28,050 --> 00:34:33,690
30 soap opera style stories about a

692
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:36,000
Filipino couple named Ben and joy where

693
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:37,770
the couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> would talk about daily</font>

694
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,630
financial issues that they were going

695
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:41,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">through for example should they save</font>

696
00:34:39,630 --> 00:34:43,410
money for<font color="#E5E5E5"> their daughter's school or</font>

697
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:47,430
should then use the money to gamble

698
00:34:43,409 --> 00:34:51,000
impact fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> but just that's really a</font>

699
00:34:47,429 --> 00:34:53,429
problem at first Mercy Corps was only

700
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,320
going to send the stories via SMS text

701
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:58,680
message and the recipients with text

702
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,230
back you know text 14 pack waiting 24

703
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:04,700
daughter's education but we suggested

704
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:07,800
also using pre-recorded voice calls

705
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:09,990
where the recipient would receive the

706
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:12,630
call here the soap opera<font color="#E5E5E5"> story play out</font>

707
00:35:09,990 --> 00:35:14,790
and then press<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 for this answer or</font>

708
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:18,810
press<font color="#E5E5E5"> 2 for this answer during the call</font>

709
00:35:14,790 --> 00:35:22,230
that's a nice so they decided to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do both</font>

710
00:35:18,810 --> 00:35:24,720
to test the effectiveness which they

711
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:26,580
sent some recipients the stories via SMS

712
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:28,430
and some of the pre-recorded voice

713
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:30,020
stories and

714
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:33,859
this is the results from one batch of

715
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:35,839
the stories they did 11 stories in this

716
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:41,450
patch so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> results of the SMS</font>

717
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:44,869
poles for 6987 people and so the total

718
00:35:41,450 --> 00:35:47,089
coal questions sent was 76,000 and they

719
00:35:44,869 --> 00:35:50,650
received<font color="#CCCCCC"> their responses from five</font>

720
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:53,900
percent of those people and out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

721
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:55,880
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know some response questions exactly</font>

722
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:58,130
like Rick was saying where who is this

723
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:02,869
or they you know they would can you send

724
00:35:58,130 --> 00:36:07,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">me load so but they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so there were</font>

725
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:10,510
actually about 1600 or there were 200

726
00:36:07,329 --> 00:36:12,619
2263 valid responses and out of those

727
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:15,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">seventy-four percent that the right</font>

728
00:36:12,619 --> 00:36:16,990
answer um so that was really good for

729
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:20,720
mercy corps they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font>

730
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:22,640
their training was successful and then

731
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,459
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the result</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the voiced polls</font>

732
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:28,970
which they originally did this for fewer

733
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:31,339
people 1226 because a lot of times

734
00:36:28,970 --> 00:36:33,740
people see voice calls is more expensive

735
00:36:31,339 --> 00:36:36,558
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS text so they don't tend to do</font>

736
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:40,819
them but the total<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of responses</font>

737
00:36:36,559 --> 00:36:43,640
was thirty-seven percent so<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually as</font>

738
00:36:40,819 --> 00:36:46,009
many people like they got as many

739
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:49,848
responses for the voice calls even

740
00:36:46,010 --> 00:36:53,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">though there were you know 16 of the</font>

741
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:55,730
people and a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> accuracy rate so</font>

742
00:36:53,359 --> 00:37:03,680
they about seventy two percent of people

743
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:05,390
got the question correct so we joined

744
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:08,299
Mercy Corps and talking to program

745
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:10,460
recipients our team visited a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the</font>

746
00:37:08,299 --> 00:37:11,720
recipients to find some of the reasons

747
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:15,740
the voice call engage<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was so much</font>

748
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:19,160
higher and one pretty obvious thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

749
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:21,649
cost something you generally percipient

750
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,960
to send an SMS packs back it's possible

751
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:25,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">if you use a shortcode or some other</font>

752
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:27,319
things but sometimes that's very

753
00:37:25,730 --> 00:37:30,619
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up especially last</font>

754
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:34,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">minute and it doesn't cost the recipient</font>

755
00:37:30,619 --> 00:37:36,770
anything to respond to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the voice call</font>

756
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:40,549
pole they just get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have one or</font>

757
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:42,170
press two and then additionally<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

758
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:44,870
voice call was very engaging

759
00:37:42,170 --> 00:37:47,900
for participants so they really<font color="#CCCCCC"> loved</font>

760
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:51,049
listening<font color="#CCCCCC"> to it from coming from I would</font>

761
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:54,080
in the United States originally and you

762
00:37:51,050 --> 00:37:57,160
get a lot of hello please vote for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama</font>

763
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:59,420
during election season<font color="#CCCCCC"> robo calls and</font>

764
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:01,940
you get really annoyed and screen your

765
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:03,710
calls during election season but these

766
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:06,530
type of people they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> never received a</font>

767
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:08,300
beta voice call before they loved it we

768
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:10,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked them how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> long they thought the</font>

769
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:13,700
messages were they've said<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes</font>

770
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:16,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the messages were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two minutes and they</font>

771
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:21,500
wanted them to be longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loved them</font>

772
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:24,200
so soon after this project a typo poopit

773
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,290
hit the<font color="#CCCCCC"> philippines and was originally</font>

774
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:30,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same path as typhoon haiyan has</font>

775
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:33,140
been so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mercy Corps already had these</font>

776
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,630
contacts in their account on engage

777
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:39,440
spark and so they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to act</font>

778
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:42,110
immediately within 24 hours and set up a

779
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,000
quick disaster preparedness alert

780
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,400
message to send on the behalf of the

781
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:48,020
humanitarian community so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

782
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,810
a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> examples of messages that they</font>

783
00:38:48,020 --> 00:38:54,290
said you know how to prepare do the next

784
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:56,390
one and but you know telling people

785
00:38:54,290 --> 00:39:00,190
please monitor these announcements and

786
00:38:56,390 --> 00:39:04,270
don't listen to rumors we sent out the

787
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:07,280
numbers to call for emergency hotlines

788
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:11,870
and people really<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciated those</font>

789
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:13,730
messages and would text back replies not

790
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:15,920
asking for load but saying thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

791
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:19,580
not forgetting about us and we really

792
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,800
feel like we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cared about so I</font>

793
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:25,370
wanted to mention another innovation

794
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:27,320
that we use at engage spark that also

795
00:39:25,370 --> 00:39:31,750
makes use of the great voice call

796
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:33,860
technology and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> low-income</font>

797
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:37,030
communities already do<font color="#CCCCCC"> this around</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

798
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:39,080
world in especially Africa and East Asia

799
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:43,460
they use voice calls it's a way of

800
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:46,400
signaling another person by doing the

801
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:49,760
Philippines<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's missed call Africa it's</font>

802
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,080
splash or deep basically you call

803
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,890
someone and then hang<font color="#E5E5E5"> out before they</font>

804
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:54,779
answer and the tell

805
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:57,870
provided hate this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can't</font>

806
00:39:54,780 --> 00:39:59,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge anyone for it and then you know</font>

807
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:03,660
that can act as the signaling mechanism

808
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:05,190
and say one miss call means I'm gonna be

809
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there to miss Paul means I'm running</font>

810
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:13,920
late yeah which probably happens a lot

811
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:16,160
in those countries muffins so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

812
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:18,240
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> great way that low-income</font>

813
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:21,180
marginalized groups can share their

814
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,299
opinion for an<font color="#CCCCCC"> example an NGO could</font>

815
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:27,480
advertise over the radio here is a local

816
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:29,460
issue to share your opinion do a missed

817
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:31,170
call to this number to vote<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes you a</font>

818
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:33,360
missed call to this other number to vote

819
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:37,530
no and then they collect the reports and

820
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:40,140
it would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> free also people could help</font>

821
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:43,110
register themselves using engage spark

822
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:45,540
for a mobile campaign by doing a missed

823
00:40:43,110 --> 00:40:47,400
call to a phone number and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> big</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> spark</font>

824
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:49,920
could immediately send them back a voice

825
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:51,240
survey and then they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh that would</font>

826
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,780
be free they can just press one or two

827
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:58,379
and you get all the answers so just to

828
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:00,360
show you quickly the tool I you can send

829
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:04,380
your campaigns<font color="#CCCCCC"> engagement contacts</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

830
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:05,700
reports you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> pick which kind of</font>

831
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,170
message you want to send it doesn't

832
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:12,540
announcements alerts polls just very

833
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:14,280
easily you set up your messages so we

834
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:15,690
wanted to create a tool that you don't

835
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:18,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">need any tech savvy to use if you can</font>

836
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,010
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use this tool</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> gets</font>

837
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:22,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of NGO people who are very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good at</font>

838
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:25,470
doing these types of programs they're

839
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:28,560
not back technologically sophisticated

840
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:29,609
um even I you know I'm I worked in

841
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:32,700
corporate Tekkit on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

842
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:35,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">technologically sophisticated I you can</font>

843
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:39,299
insert because my<font color="#E5E5E5"> dad I'll you know the</font>

844
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:41,610
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> name translations keep going he</font>

845
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:42,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">can set up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> second step come what</font>

846
00:41:41,610 --> 00:41:46,380
your contacts<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and then the third</font>

847
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:50,189
step is you launch and send and then

848
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:53,480
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> done and then leave the last</font>

849
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,470
slide which is then you can view reports

850
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:57,260
basically you know if you ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

851
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:59,669
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> your number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one daily concern</font>

852
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,800
here's just a sample you know physical

853
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:04,140
safety food nutrition and you could very

854
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:06,360
easily see what people's responses were

855
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:10,620
so you can actually

856
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:12,780
do this to test it out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you write down</font>

857
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:14,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">this phone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> number and instead a text</font>

858
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:18,060
message to it with the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

859
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:19,650
you're from so you're ready at the

860
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">Philippines phone number so if your</font>

861
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:24,690
international will be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be an</font>

862
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:30,960
international text but + 63 is the

863
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:38,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">philippines area code and then 9 158 652</font>

864
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:40,410

the name of the country<font color="#CCCCCC"> where based and</font>

870
00:42:52,950 --> 00:43:00,240
one more time yes all right I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

871
00:42:54,630 --> 00:43:06,380
a side with it 63 is the country code to

872
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,379
or yep six clears the country code 9 158

873

I'll tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> a graph with where people are</font>

876
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:24,540
from from this session um yes I put a so

877
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:27,270
when if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you text that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> message you'll get</font>

878
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:28,800
an automatic reply back and it will give

879
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:30,720
my twitter handle and it will also give

880
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:33,030
you the hashtag that out that<font color="#E5E5E5"> i will use</font>

881
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">to post that so you can check that right</font>

882
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">after the session</font>

883
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:44,330
you

884
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:51,220
so um I work for open garden we<font color="#E5E5E5"> publish</font>

885
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,500
an application and mobile application

886
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:54,700
called fire chats I don't know how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many</font>

887
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:57,130
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> heard of fire chat</font>

888
00:43:54,700 --> 00:44:06,160
especially in the context of the Hong

889
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:07,780
Kong elections so what what I'll do is

890
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:10,330
there maybe just stop very briefly about

891
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the technology this is a picture that</font>

892
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:16,960
was taken at Admiralty in Hong Kong

893
00:44:14,130 --> 00:44:19,060
feral cats what the technology does is

894
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,210
that it if you have fire chats on your

895
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,009
phone the application will sniff around

896
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:26,680
for other phones in the vicinity that

897
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:29,110
are also equipped and it will establish

898
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,910
a direct communication with the other

899
00:44:29,110 --> 00:44:35,170
phones so that you can communicate

900
00:44:30,910 --> 00:44:38,440
without a cell network or an<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

901
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:41,500
access of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course when you have a lot of</font>

902
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:45,130
phones that are close by and a high

903
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:47,020
density of fire chat users the data can

904
00:44:45,130 --> 00:44:49,060
just hop hop hop and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it creates what we</font>

905
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,940
call a daisy chain<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you can</font>

906
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:53,680
cover<font color="#E5E5E5"> kilometers on end without any</font>

907
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:57,790
network so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what happened in hong</font>

908
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,100
kong in hong kong we had a hundred

909
00:44:57,790 --> 00:45:03,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">thousand downloads in the first 22 hours</font>

910
00:45:00,100 --> 00:45:05,890
and eventually after one week there was

911
00:45:03,130 --> 00:45:08,050
half a million fried chat users this is

912
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:12,430
a place with<font color="#CCCCCC"> seven million people you</font>

913
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:14,500
know so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i have more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures of hong</font>

914
00:45:12,430 --> 00:45:17,770
kong<font color="#E5E5E5"> um yeah so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this is what time</font>

915
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:21,940
magazine this is another picture what's

916
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:23,680
really unique is that we've gone to some

917
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,020
mesh networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've been around for a</font>

918
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,210
long time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know five judges may</font>

919
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:31,110
be the first time that the promise of

920
00:45:28,210 --> 00:45:33,460
sharing network is delivered to skate

921
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:35,650
you can basically create your own local

922
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:39,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet just with your phones and a</font>

923
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">free app this is the mesh network so on</font>

924
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">your left is a traditional network with</font>

925
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:47,730
one centralized note typically at our

926
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:53,440
the mesh takes a network to the edges by

927
00:45:47,730 --> 00:45:55,420
connecting the the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes yeah so</font>

928
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,290
we have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> pictures of where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> five chat</font>

929
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,600
was used this is burning man

930
00:45:57,290 --> 00:46:03,320
um it's a middle of the desert there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

931
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:09,650
no network this was the first kind of

932
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:13,070
massive usage of the technology so this

933
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:14,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">is where we are right now there are very</font>

934
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:19,460
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways many different ways that</font>

935
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:21,830
the technology can be used so one is of

936
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:26,950
course in and we sing<font color="#CCCCCC"> lease in Latin</font>

937
00:46:21,830 --> 00:46:29,720
America a lot in highly dense

938
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:31,520
populations and an urban<font color="#E5E5E5"> centers people</font>

939
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:34,189
are using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a free way to network</font>

940
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">door-to-door and actually the first</font>

941
00:46:34,190 --> 00:46:40,910
usage of that was in April<font color="#E5E5E5"> last year</font>

942
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:43,400
when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gap was just launched the first</font>

943
00:46:40,910 --> 00:46:45,710
bike was actually in Iraq there was an

944
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:48,890
internet outage and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> one weekend</font>

945
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:51,710
40,000 people started using fire chat to

946
00:46:48,890 --> 00:46:53,779
just communicate with our neighbors so

947
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,760
that's one and then in places where

948
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:59,600
there is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> no connectivity but you do</font>

949
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:01,310
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> clusters of people you can just</font>

950
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">create your own local internet and so in</font>

951
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:07,640
the future we think that those networks

952
00:47:03,830 --> 00:47:10,850
can also be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for people to do things</font>

953
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:15,710
like gaming or mobile payments using the

954
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:17,299
same peer-to-peer technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> um we know</font>

955
00:47:15,710 --> 00:47:21,350
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> useful in emergency</font>

956
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:23,680
situations we were seeing small spikes

957
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:31,970
you know every<font color="#E5E5E5"> time there is a disaster</font>

958
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:36,700
related situation yes so this is our

959
00:47:31,970 --> 00:47:41,540
latest<font color="#E5E5E5"> project so it's our first device</font>

960
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:43,520
it's a it's a bit cold<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

961
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:49,820
basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way of increasing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

962
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:54,050
density of of of nose so this mimics

963
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:56,780
actually a phone and so you just place

964
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:59,720
it somewhere and then what it does is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

965
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:02,480
stocks messages fire chat messages and

966
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:06,379
then transmits them to<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody in walks</font>

967
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:09,910
nearby who also has fire chart on their

968
00:48:06,380 --> 00:48:14,170
phones so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is our answer to</font>

969
00:48:09,910 --> 00:48:16,680
of the drones the balloons in all these

970
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:18,970
type of solutions are coming up now

971
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we're coming to the realization of</font>

972
00:48:18,970 --> 00:48:26,649
a smartphone penetration is skyrocketing

973
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:29,559
everywhere in the world be people are so

974
00:48:26,650 --> 00:48:33,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">hungry for that I like changing and</font>

975
00:48:29,559 --> 00:48:35,410
communicating see the towers<font color="#E5E5E5"> just can't</font>

976
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:37,750
cope not really expensive it takes a

977
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:40,149
long time<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so what are the</font>

978
00:48:37,750 --> 00:48:42,549
alternatives<font color="#CCCCCC"> so we have the balloons we</font>

979
00:48:40,150 --> 00:48:45,309
have internet.org we have all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

980
00:48:42,549 --> 00:48:52,240
things this is an inexpensive way of

981
00:48:45,309 --> 00:48:55,119
also creating local internet and so the

982
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:59,259
reason why we're here is to connect to

983
00:48:55,119 --> 00:49:01,510
civil society<font color="#E5E5E5"> NGOs and nonprofits we</font>

984
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:05,109
want to understand how we can help you

985
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:08,740
do your work and enrich<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communities I</font>

986
00:49:05,109 --> 00:49:10,569
have a few pictures<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more situations</font>

987
00:49:08,740 --> 00:49:13,538
where fired chat was used so this is

988
00:49:10,569 --> 00:49:16,569
Paris in January after<font color="#CCCCCC"> their Jewish</font>

989
00:49:13,539 --> 00:49:19,140
family events there was 1 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

990
00:49:16,569 --> 00:49:20,920
in the street so it's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> biggest</font>

991
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:24,339
demonstration since the end of World War

992
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:26,829
two there was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tweet that we didn't do</font>

993
00:49:24,339 --> 00:49:29,589
anything there there was a quitter went

994
00:49:26,829 --> 00:49:32,079
out in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the morning from the French</font>

995
00:49:29,589 --> 00:49:34,359
government say somebody in the French

996
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:38,049
government saying download file chat

997
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:40,839
before you go out and then in one day we

998
00:49:38,049 --> 00:49:42,549
had<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12,000 downloads and we know that</font>

999
00:49:40,839 --> 00:49:47,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">people have some pictures</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what people</font>

1000
00:49:42,549 --> 00:49:51,690
were talking about yeah so this one step

1001
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:54,520
before we're just explain yeah so

1002
00:49:51,690 --> 00:49:56,170
there's about<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1000 a hundred thousand</font>

1003
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:58,029
conversations that Dale people were

1004
00:49:56,170 --> 00:50:00,549
helping each other like all this metro

1005
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:04,420
station is completely saturated don't go

1006
00:50:00,549 --> 00:50:08,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">there all these persons feeling unwell I</font>

1008
00:50:08,109 --> 00:50:15,598

1009
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:18,819
now supports pictures text links and

1010
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:20,440
these are the top<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the of the screen</font>

1011
00:50:18,819 --> 00:50:22,779
there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of the chat room and</font>

the link<font color="#CCCCCC"> that takes you to where the</font>

1015
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:30,720
conversations take place in the app is

1016
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:37,270
shareable everywhere on SMS<font color="#CCCCCC"> and inner</font>

1017
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:40,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">etc this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is vanilla Pope Francis came in</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">January and so we partner with a local</font>

1019
00:50:40,750 --> 00:50:44,860
news organization to lock on your news

1020
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:49,060
organizations<font color="#E5E5E5"> called</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rapier and GNA</font>

1021
00:50:44,860 --> 00:50:50,890
networks they did a new form of<font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

1022
00:50:49,060 --> 00:50:53,950
reporting for us which was kind of

1023
00:50:50,890 --> 00:50:58,859
up-to-the-minute news on what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1024
00:50:53,950 --> 00:51:01,540
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the ground some screenshots also</font>

1025
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:03,610
yeah so they were saying all the Pope

1026
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:05,860
has arrived on the Pope kiss the baby

1027
00:51:03,610 --> 00:51:08,350
all this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is great and so I was a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mix up</font>

1028
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:11,100
the journal is<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking the people</font>

1029
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:13,630
reacting and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course we know that this</font>

1030
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:16,870
online usage because the app also works

1031
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:19,780
online and so you create these fast chat

1032
00:51:16,870 --> 00:51:22,000
rooms around one topic we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this</font>

1033
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:25,120
online usage that was driven<font color="#E5E5E5"> by media</font>

1034
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,390
also triggered off the grid message of

1035
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:30,970
course<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can't see those msgs not</font>

1036
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:32,529
physically close to the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1037
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:38,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is what we could see from the</font>

1038
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:42,460
online users so if you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1039
00:51:38,650 --> 00:51:45,280
experiment with the app we've created a

1040
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:47,790
chat room for rights gone and so what

1041
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:50,920
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to do is just can't be out on</font>

1042
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:55,000
catch fire chat calm and then follow

1043
00:51:50,920 --> 00:51:56,350
this link from from their mobile just

1044
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:59,440
enter it in the browser of your mobile

1045
00:51:56,350 --> 00:52:02,140
and then you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to just join the</font>

1046
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:04,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">conversation that we're having about</font>

1047
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:05,650
rights gone and it's also a way in

1048
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:08,680
situations like this like a conference

1049
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:12,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">for people to stay in touch after after</font>

1050
00:52:08,680 --> 00:52:15,790
an event so it creates its own community

1051
00:52:12,570 --> 00:52:19,060
maybe we just go that is it yeah which

1052
00:52:15,790 --> 00:52:25,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one breaks we just leave that some</font>

1053
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:25,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">may be the slag with the child that's it</font>

1054
00:52:28,290 --> 00:52:35,680
so you're ready<font color="#E5E5E5"> now for questions any</font>

1055
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:43,510
question yes can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> come up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the mic</font>

1056
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:45,970
please hi I'm Angie from access so so

1057
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:48,700
because you know excess is focusing on

1058
00:52:45,970 --> 00:52:51,879
digital security a lot i guess like one

1059
00:52:48,700 --> 00:52:54,339
of my main concern for fire chat and

1060
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:57,340
also for all the other apps presented

1061
00:52:54,340 --> 00:53:01,330
today is like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security issue like</font>

1062
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:05,410
what what is the security level for

1063
00:53:01,330 --> 00:53:07,630
these kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of apps and how accessible</font>

1064
00:53:05,410 --> 00:53:10,118
for the security information for the

1065
00:53:07,630 --> 00:53:13,869
users and how easy for the user to

1066
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:17,470
understand and defend themselves to

1067
00:53:13,869 --> 00:53:21,730
avoid from the adversary attack<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1068
00:53:17,470 --> 00:53:25,000
from like stabs so like I this is my

1069
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:28,360
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks ok can we can we have</font>

1070
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:31,750
those questions answered very briefly so

1071
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:33,369
that could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> back with my read so</font>

1072
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:35,830
you're right it's a really good<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

1073
00:53:33,369 --> 00:53:37,930
so five counties are men pity too many

1074
00:53:35,830 --> 00:53:39,910
messaging application for now so

1075
00:53:37,930 --> 00:53:41,740
everybody can see all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> messages and</font>

1076
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:44,080
we've always been<font color="#CCCCCC"> very clear that there</font>

1077
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:48,399
was no privacy we encourage<font color="#CCCCCC"> people to</font>

1078
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:49,900
use pseudonyms they want so you know you

1079
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:51,880
should we always very clear that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1080
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:55,359
shouldn't type anything in<font color="#E5E5E5"> power that</font>

1081
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:56,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't want anybody else to see so</font>

1082
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:59,410
yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we also do is create</font>

1083
00:53:56,830 --> 00:54:01,109
verified accounts for trusted voices so

1084
00:53:59,410 --> 00:54:03,160
typically in a situation like a protest

1085
00:54:01,109 --> 00:54:05,890
you would have you would want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1086
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:07,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the journalist for example saying this</font>

1087
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:16,410
is my<font color="#E5E5E5"> voice I'm standing for what I'm</font>

1088
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:20,430
saying so yeah um yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> our CEO is from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1089
00:54:16,410 --> 00:54:23,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Silicon Valley with three corporate data</font>

1090
00:54:20,430 --> 00:54:27,190
company started<font color="#E5E5E5"> fences and exits before</font>

1091
00:54:23,650 --> 00:54:29,980
he moved here so and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I work with a an</font>

1092
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:32,320
NGO before and just with some of those

1093
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:35,320
backgrounds it's so difficult of course

1094
00:54:32,320 --> 00:54:38,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">so many communities but I I guess</font>

1095
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,130
personally<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough our organization</font>

1096
00:54:38,180 --> 00:54:45,350
everything is encrypted you know we try

1097
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:49,300
to make video<font color="#E5E5E5"> very clear in tests and</font>

1098
00:54:45,350 --> 00:54:52,700
policies and there are similarly like

1099
00:54:49,300 --> 00:54:55,880
you can't just log in<font color="#CCCCCC"> and send a million</font>

1100
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:58,609
messages you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know we can flag that</font>

1101
00:54:55,880 --> 00:55:00,440
instantly and block it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think that</font>

1102
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:02,300
is super critical for a lot of these

1103
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:04,300
tools if you don't have somebody coming

1104
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:07,970
from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of background who knows</font>

1105
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:10,100
the digital security measures then that

1106
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:13,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">need to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in place because this is</font>

1107
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:17,210
people's private data that there's

1108
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:20,630
something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so yeah about the bubbly</font>

1109
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:23,840
so we are basically registering the user

1110
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:27,950
based on the the local same which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1111
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:30,890
used in your mobile<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone so spamming is</font>

1112
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,899
no issue because we are sending the past

1113
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:35,750
keys to that particular number for a

1114
00:55:32,900 --> 00:55:37,910
verification number one that is only

1115
00:55:35,750 --> 00:55:40,430
possible if somebody's cloning the same

1116
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:42,020
but then it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is beyond</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our control then</font>

1117
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:45,410
it becomes the issue for the telecom

1118
00:55:42,020 --> 00:55:49,840
carriers that is fun number two about

1119
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">the content yes this becomes a real</font>

1120
00:55:49,840 --> 00:55:57,920
concern for many off for people so what

1121
00:55:54,290 --> 00:56:00,800
we do is we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing the moderation on</font>

1122
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:04,130
the content so we have some certain

1123
00:56:00,800 --> 00:56:09,320
tools that moderate the content and we

1124
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:11,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">tries any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> abusive or any language which</font>

1125
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:14,420
might hurt the community so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1126
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:16,279
trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do that but again there are</font>

1127
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:19,930
some challenges when it comes to the

1128
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:22,790
local land which is like perhaps

1129
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:24,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">Filipinos or Indonesian because our</font>

1130
00:56:22,790 --> 00:56:26,810
tools may support the English language

1131
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:29,450
very well very accurately but may not

1132
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:31,640
support that accurately 20 the local

1133
00:56:29,450 --> 00:56:34,730
language<font color="#CCCCCC"> then we have to depend on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1134
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:36,950
bandwagon<font color="#CCCCCC"> or operation so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

1135
00:56:34,730 --> 00:56:43,490
normally we do when it comes to the

1136
00:56:36,950 --> 00:56:45,830
security yeah yes hi thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for your</font>

1137
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:47,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">presentation I had a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> specific question</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">what research or feedback you've</font>

00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,470
generated from that volunteer network

1149
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,570
because it seems like one of the biggest

1150
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:20,419
outcomes potentially is like the

1151
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:22,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">community that's developed around this</font>

1152
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:25,130
work and the possibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for that</font>

1153
00:57:22,609 --> 00:57:27,560
community to continue doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> civic</font>

1154
00:57:25,130 --> 00:57:30,079
participation in other points of

1155
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:33,920
political engagement yeah actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

1156
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:37,760
the communities it's a a aggregate of

1157
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,770
all the volunteers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that generated also</font>

1158
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,470
by eight by partners so what we did is

1159
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:45,430
we have our Corps volunteers so that's

1160
00:57:42,470 --> 00:57:47,959
one that's the volunteers<font color="#CCCCCC"> Manning the</font>

1161
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:51,980
headquarters so that's around some 30 to

1162
00:57:47,960 --> 00:57:55,040
40 people so mostly students who is 16

1163
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:56,960
different languages and then our partner

1164
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">organization so those really are their</font>

1165
00:57:56,960 --> 00:58:03,380
whole appears so they just forecasted

1166
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:06,890
outnumbered and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> there so we use</font>

1167
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:10,400
these are number two to report<font color="#CCCCCC"> they'll</font>

1168
00:58:06,890 --> 00:58:12,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> insured like a thousand at least one</font>

1169
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:15,020
per pound so that's a thousand five

1170
00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:18,079
hundred volunteers coordinators that

1171
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:20,599
that's we are containing<font color="#E5E5E5"> but every</font>

1172
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,780
election is every three years in the

1173
00:58:20,599 --> 00:58:27,050
Philippines so they are done and we are

1174
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:31,300
again using the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same technology for the</font>

1175
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:34,190
automated elections so um we have been

1176
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:36,920
coordinating with them on updates and

1177
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:38,599
stuff but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third a thousand mostly</font>

1178
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:41,420
most of them<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> abolished by other</font>

1179
00:58:38,599 --> 00:58:44,599
organizations so what we have is around

1180
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:47,450
some 2,000<font color="#E5E5E5"> volunteer stuff is really our</font>

1181
00:58:44,599 --> 00:58:50,990
our own so we are continuously engaging

1182
00:58:47,450 --> 00:58:53,720
with them because yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> electronics is</font>

1183
00:58:50,990 --> 00:58:55,790
again coming and the same technology so

1184
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:59,598
we're hoping<font color="#CCCCCC"> that my 36th a little bit</font>

1185
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:03,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">easier thing to do because the same sets</font>

1186
00:58:59,599 --> 00:59:04,339
of tools and<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff so let's see I like</font>

1187
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,979
the art or something

1188
00:59:04,339 --> 00:59:09,349
we're partnering with compact<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer</font>

1189
00:59:06,979 --> 00:59:11,419
professional now it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the bullet theory</font>

1190
00:59:09,349 --> 00:59:13,880
such as for election day that they have

1191
00:59:11,420 --> 00:59:15,650
to also watch your vote and this is one

1192
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:18,229
<font color="#CCCCCC">way we will continually engagement after</font>

1193
00:59:15,650 --> 00:59:20,509
the election so that's another that's

1194
00:59:18,229 --> 00:59:27,439
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> come in so are the next</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> questions</font>

1200
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:42,799
in Jacob and Jacob and then expanded to

1201
00:59:41,059 --> 00:59:45,200
seven cities in<font color="#CCCCCC"> an insurer we build apps</font>

1202
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:48,200
on mobile phones that where citizens can

1203
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:50,718
report well when I would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask is</font>

1204
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:53,479
how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> engage the government in this</font>

1205
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:55,910
case probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> Conway on the end rooster</font>

1206
00:59:53,479 --> 00:59:58,368
generated from your project how are they

1207
00:59:55,910 --> 01:00:01,219
responding to them yeah so for about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 34</font>

1208
00:59:58,369 --> 01:00:03,799
th we are actually a member or we have

1209
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:08,150
this length automated election system

1210
01:00:03,799 --> 01:00:09,920
watch like 33 years before the elections

1211
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:12,440
so it's a collaboration between

1212
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:15,619
different IP groups computer

1213
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:18,289
professionals so different groups at

1214
01:00:15,619 --> 01:00:19,880
first what we did<font color="#CCCCCC"> is to educate the</font>

1215
01:00:18,289 --> 01:00:22,519
people and what as what are the dangers

1216
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,160
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage a sort of introductions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1217
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:27,799
then we created some materials or for

1218
01:00:25,160 --> 01:00:29,779
the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> group a Squatch</font>

1219
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:32,538
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> bolt report and cpu is a number</font>

1220
01:00:29,779 --> 01:00:37,339
we've been engaging the community even

1221
01:00:32,539 --> 01:00:41,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">before the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> aqua implementation um they I</font>

1222
01:00:37,339 --> 01:00:43,249
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the point that when you go to</font>

1223
01:00:41,329 --> 01:00:45,589
the communal coffees and then they see

1224
01:00:43,249 --> 01:00:48,649
that you are from a Squatch<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know the</font>

1225
01:00:45,589 --> 01:00:51,499
able to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> earth they already know you</font>

1226
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:53,359
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> these people are always saying the</font>

1227
01:00:51,499 --> 01:00:57,618
way the election will not do good stuff

1228
01:00:53,359 --> 01:01:00,859
I mean we have a third we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> extensive</font>

1229
01:00:57,619 --> 01:01:03,829
research we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have 30 water abilities we</font>

1230
01:01:00,859 --> 01:01:05,719
call it 30 vulnerabilities and 30 how to

1231
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:08,180
fix those vulnerabilities if you fix

1232
01:01:05,719 --> 01:01:09,950
those spirits and things then we can go

1233
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:13,460
on with our elections we represent

1234
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:15,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">elector for milliken search we have we</font>

1235
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:17,230
ever have one or two officials are

1236
01:01:15,460 --> 01:01:19,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">supporting us but then</font>

1237
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:22,210
and they just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do to go on</font>

1238
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:25,300
without automative directions so just

1239
01:01:22,210 --> 01:01:29,970
like how while the home Alec did not

1240
01:01:25,300 --> 01:01:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">heed our whatever we engagement we have</font>

1241
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:34,868
most of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the predictions that</font>

1242
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:38,560
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have before the election it happened</font>

1243
01:01:34,869 --> 01:01:41,320
so we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems on transmissions we</font>

1244
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:44,529
have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> on definitely have balance</font>

1245
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:46,660
that are larger than the feeder and then

1246
01:01:44,530 --> 01:01:50,790
the teacher have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> cut that pileup and</font>

1247
01:01:46,660 --> 01:01:54,250
then when when the whole ballot box we

1248
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:58,440
were in the machine is put put on top

1249
01:01:54,250 --> 01:02:01,240
some some teachers would have to like

1250
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,300
pound it with a ruler such that other

1251
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:06,339
ballot could get me so we have those

1252
01:02:04,300 --> 01:02:08,020
kind of problems that even before

1253
01:02:06,340 --> 01:02:10,810
Election Day even before the

1254
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:13,300
implementation our network<font color="#E5E5E5"> both report</font>

1255
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:14,920
and all other ID groups have been in the

1256
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">chimeric</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that these are the villagers</font>

1257
01:02:14,920 --> 01:02:19,750
we're doing it<font color="#E5E5E5"> for like a year because</font>

1258
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:22,180
they implemented it for less<font color="#CCCCCC"> than a year</font>

1259
01:02:19,750 --> 01:02:26,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's they say it's good is this way</font>

1260
01:02:22,180 --> 01:02:30,339
and then so without<font color="#CCCCCC"> it forcibly had</font>

1261
01:02:26,410 --> 01:02:34,720
that's what that's what happened so this

1262
01:02:30,340 --> 01:02:36,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for Lisa I think so how</font>

1263
01:02:34,720 --> 01:02:38,410
worried are you about novelty effects

1264
01:02:36,490 --> 01:02:40,089
for these interventions you said that

1265
01:02:38,410 --> 01:02:41,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">people were really excited because they</font>

1266
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:42,970
were using they were getting called for

1267
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,470
the first time by these robots the

1268
01:02:42,970 --> 01:02:50,770
fourth<font color="#CCCCCC"> time is significantly less</font>

1269
01:02:44,470 --> 01:02:55,689
exciting that seems like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a concern um so</font>

1270
01:02:50,770 --> 01:02:58,630
again I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we found</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that uh in a</font>

1271
01:02:55,690 --> 01:03:05,800
very interesting way for but so where

1272
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:08,050
are you from yes okay uh so we kind of

1273
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:09,480
have this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm also from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the US and I</font>

1274
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:11,770
don't know how many other countries

1275
01:03:09,480 --> 01:03:14,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">robocalls or auto calls are really a</font>

1276
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:17,800
negative connotation or really a thing

1277
01:03:14,010 --> 01:03:20,020
but I mean we sent these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people a lot I</font>

1278
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:23,740
mean you know there were 11 automated

1279
01:03:20,020 --> 01:03:25,780
calls and the response<font color="#E5E5E5"> rates increase</font>

1280
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:28,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a curiosity of the response rates</font>

1281
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:29,940
increased I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably also because</font>

1282
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:33,869
they

1283
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:35,369
I knew how to reply you know press the

1284
01:03:33,869 --> 01:03:36,480
key passes at that point they were very

1285
01:03:35,369 --> 01:03:40,560
familiar<font color="#CCCCCC"> with that they understood what</font>

1286
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:42,089
was going on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so honestly like I</font>

1287
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,740
think it depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the context that</font>

1288
01:03:42,089 --> 01:03:45,900
you're in and if you're sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> valuable</font>

1289
01:03:43,740 --> 01:03:48,299
content to those people so I think

1290
01:03:45,900 --> 01:03:51,210
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really the key for the NGO at</font>

1291
01:03:48,300 --> 01:03:54,510
that point so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course when</font>

1292
01:03:51,210 --> 01:03:58,470
you get a robocall usually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sam and</font>

1293
01:03:54,510 --> 01:04:01,250
if you are government or NGO or you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1294
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:03,779
even a business and you you know keep

1295
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:06,630
you basically have to subscribe people

1296
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:08,010
with engage spark you don't it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1297
01:04:06,630 --> 01:04:11,880
like there's a list of<font color="#CCCCCC"> numbers that you</font>

1298
01:04:08,010 --> 01:04:14,760
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> just send to so generally that's</font>

1299
01:04:11,880 --> 01:04:16,380
what you basically do is just you need

1300
01:04:14,760 --> 01:04:19,530
to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your content is out at</font>

1301
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:21,210
all but yeah we may send probably 30

1302
01:04:19,530 --> 01:04:23,579
calls and then response rates really

1303
01:04:21,210 --> 01:04:28,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">increased each time anyone one love a</font>

1304
01:04:23,579 --> 01:04:32,520
question over here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll go to you</font>

1305
01:04:28,069 --> 01:04:37,349
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 minutes for questions so that</font>

1306
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:39,660
some have as many as you can equate hi

1307
01:04:37,349 --> 01:04:41,609
I'm Liz I Rex international nonprofit

1308
01:04:39,660 --> 01:04:44,129
organization I was just wondering about

1309
01:04:41,609 --> 01:04:47,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">the localization of the apps in how many</font>

1310
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:49,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">languages</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are there by uncle thank you</font>

1311
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:52,319
so quickly for<font color="#E5E5E5"> engaged spark it's</font>

1312
01:04:49,790 --> 01:04:54,240
available<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 plus countries pretty</font>

1313
01:04:52,319 --> 01:04:57,810
much every country in the world and we

1314
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:00,720
do support Unicode I the app itself is

1315
01:04:57,810 --> 01:05:03,119
not work or startup so we were doing a

1316
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:05,490
lot of life live programs but eventually

1317
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:07,020
the app will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be in our goal is to have a</font>

1318
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:08,220
drink with<font color="#E5E5E5"> your savvy language but right</font>

1319
01:05:07,020 --> 01:05:12,329
now you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> send messages in any</font>

1320
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:14,430
language yes localization is very

1321
01:05:12,329 --> 01:05:16,680
important especially for this part of

1322
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:18,890
the world we're not all the people are

1323
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:22,919
English speaking people so for us

1324
01:05:18,890 --> 01:05:26,730
because our app is also supporting the

1325
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">ivy ah so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people can dial a particular</font>

1326
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:32,400
shortcode thankfully<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telcos have</font>

1327
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:34,710
given us a foreman<font color="#E5E5E5"> shortcode in the</font>

1328
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,660
respective countries for example in

1329
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:42,359
philippines we have asterisk<font color="#CCCCCC"> s2000 in</font>

1330
01:05:38,660 --> 01:05:43,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">indonesia we have 5 2000 so when the</font>

1331
01:05:42,359 --> 01:05:46,069
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1332
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:48,109
indonesia they call<font color="#CCCCCC"> 52 thousand so they</font>

1333
01:05:46,070 --> 01:05:51,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">get all the menu in their own language</font>

1334
01:05:48,109 --> 01:05:53,690
that is in faster<font color="#CCCCCC"> interracial</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if the</font>

1335
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:55,760
people who are in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bangladesh all who are</font>

1336
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:58,250
in India so when they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> calling they</font>

1337
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:01,040
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting entire information in their</font>

1338
01:05:58,250 --> 01:06:05,060
own language and moreover because it is

1339
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:08,240
based on voice so voice is certainly

1340
01:06:05,060 --> 01:06:11,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">their own language so that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1341
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:20,390
another beauty of the language priority

1342
01:06:11,030 --> 01:06:23,060
yes any question<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I'll two</font>

1343
01:06:20,390 --> 01:06:24,890
quick questions for Rick um you have all

1344
01:06:23,060 --> 01:06:29,000
these fallen future can clean out the

1345
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:33,020
rubbish<font color="#CCCCCC"> x coming in but how's the</font>

1346
01:06:29,000 --> 01:06:35,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">betting how do you bet the accuracy of</font>

1347
01:06:33,020 --> 01:06:38,869
the information coming in and m per

1348
01:06:35,780 --> 01:06:41,930
shift what's the lifetime in moderation

1349
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:44,750
because it could<font color="#E5E5E5"> be very easy for false</font>

1350
01:06:41,930 --> 01:06:48,680
alarm dis messages to to get out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1351
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:50,359
so what's the lifetime yeah so<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

1352
01:06:48,680 --> 01:06:51,890
bending of the reports actually it's a

1353
01:06:50,359 --> 01:06:54,259
simple because we are also concerned

1354
01:06:51,890 --> 01:06:56,328
that we're gonna be<font color="#CCCCCC"> taking away some</font>

1355
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:57,740
reports<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are actually for the</font>

1356
01:06:56,329 --> 01:07:00,140
volunteer it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but but</font>

1357
01:06:57,740 --> 01:07:02,240
it's already but just what we did is

1358
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:07,069
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple criteria if it's asking for</font>

1359
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:10,279
a load asking for who are you maybe des

1360
01:07:07,069 --> 01:07:17,560
close<font color="#E5E5E5"> those two main concerns and then</font>

1361
01:07:10,280 --> 01:07:21,500
some very obvious SMS thanks so we are

1362
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:25,730
now we are sure that most even if like

1363
01:07:21,500 --> 01:07:28,069
the messages cut out or some for some

1364
01:07:25,730 --> 01:07:29,780
reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not the whole message we</font>

1365
01:07:28,069 --> 01:07:32,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">have other volunteer stuff you just like</font>

1366
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:35,000
that that message<font color="#CCCCCC"> hit it hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1367
01:07:32,660 --> 01:07:36,920
some sense of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> although for the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> touch</font>

1368
01:07:35,000 --> 01:07:40,579
that bullet is that we have what we do

1369
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:42,710
is we actually call them back yeah so

1370
01:07:40,579 --> 01:07:45,050
yeah that's one if like somebody

1371
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:46,819
reported in cavite that some machine was

1372
01:07:45,050 --> 01:07:50,109
being taken out of the proceeds if they

1373
01:07:46,819 --> 01:07:52,819
got<font color="#E5E5E5"> that report we immediately calls the</font>

1374
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:56,990
trusted reporter but if it is having

1375
01:07:52,819 --> 01:08:05,930
from a random report we<font color="#E5E5E5"> normally do not</font>

1376
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:09,830
a cape<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the second part of the</font>

1377
01:08:05,930 --> 01:08:13,910
question Oh first like any mature<font color="#CCCCCC"> play</font>

1378
01:08:09,830 --> 01:08:15,950
from provider even be for every time for

1379
01:08:13,910 --> 01:08:19,460
the first time user registration we have

1380
01:08:15,950 --> 01:08:22,149
the privacy<font color="#E5E5E5"> policy to agree upon by the</font>

1381
01:08:19,460 --> 01:08:26,359
user before<font color="#CCCCCC"> entering into the platform</font>

1382
01:08:22,149 --> 01:08:29,689
number to be strongly believe that

1383
01:08:26,359 --> 01:08:34,240
instead of blocking educating is more

1384
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:37,910
important so be<font color="#E5E5E5"> timely educate our</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

1385
01:08:34,240 --> 01:08:39,889
subscribers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their native language by</font>

1386
01:08:37,910 --> 01:08:43,040
sending the text messages on their

1387
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:46,460
phones we try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate them that how</font>

1388
01:08:43,040 --> 01:08:48,560
to blog how to share with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the friends</font>

1389
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:53,390
what we speak how long to speak and so

1390
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:56,359
on number three like I said a<font color="#E5E5E5"> real also</font>

1391
01:08:53,390 --> 01:08:59,810
that we have the moderating tool but

1392
01:08:56,359 --> 01:09:03,680
they only control on<font color="#CCCCCC"> lita abusive or</font>

1393
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:07,040
offensive language or any<font color="#E5E5E5"> racial events</font>

1394
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:10,339
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on the text part we can</font>

1395
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:13,580
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> control over the voice certainly</font>

1396
01:09:10,339 --> 01:09:16,700
we need to do it manual moderation but

1397
01:09:13,580 --> 01:09:20,149
that is not on all the voice comments

1398
01:09:16,700 --> 01:09:24,200
all the voice blocks but that is done

1399
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:26,870
randomly so our moderators they do check

1400
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:29,450
and in case they find any such like

1401
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:32,689
which they<font color="#CCCCCC"> try to brought that so this</font>

1402
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:35,000
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm just going to share</font>

1403
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">a quick part 2 which is that I mean a</font>

1404
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:41,689
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> issues like verifying</font>

1405
01:09:37,330 --> 01:09:43,970
reporting and you know determining

1406
01:09:41,689 --> 01:09:45,919
whether something is offensive or not

1407
01:09:43,970 --> 01:09:47,960
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is stuff on the internet or on</font>

1408
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:50,660
these kind these kinds of platforms as

1409
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,040
well so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's probably those of</font>

1410
01:09:50,660 --> 01:09:55,010
you know there's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> other panels</font>

1411
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:57,290
later that are dealing<font color="#CCCCCC"> with those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things</font>

1412
01:09:55,010 --> 01:09:59,150
because that's something that we all do

1413
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:03,530
I so that's just something to take into

1414
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:05,780
consideration yeah 111 suppose that we

1415
01:10:03,530 --> 01:10:08,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">added is that while we capture all those</font>

1416
01:10:05,780 --> 01:10:09,719
what we think are relevant reports we

1417
01:10:08,060 --> 01:10:11,820
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> other partners like</font>

1418
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:14,120
one with contra daya and then another

1419
01:10:11,820 --> 01:10:17,670
group<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is monitoring the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> elections</font>

1420
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:20,040
through workers so what we did is we

1421
01:10:17,670 --> 01:10:21,930
make those reports available to them and

1422
01:10:20,040 --> 01:10:24,780
they'll they'll be the one to filter out

1423
01:10:21,930 --> 01:10:27,360
which reports is ready but for them so

1424
01:10:24,780 --> 01:10:29,460
in a way we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> capture all the</font>

1425
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:32,519
reports and then offer other networks

1426
01:10:29,460 --> 01:10:35,400
that would be reporting about engagement

1427
01:10:32,520 --> 01:10:38,010
of workers using on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> election day</font>

1428
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:40,860
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> up the platform so we have those</font>

1429
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:44,790
