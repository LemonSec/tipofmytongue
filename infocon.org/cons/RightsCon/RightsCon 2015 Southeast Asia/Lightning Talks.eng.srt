15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:01:06,240
brief alright so the first presentation

16

will be Molly swash no<font color="#CCCCCC"> xe8 each</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

17
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,030
presentation watching an answer and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:14,010
second all<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all for</font>

19
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:16,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">coming out to our lightning talk to the</font>

20
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:19,020
power of<font color="#E5E5E5"> seven my name is Molly schwartz</font>

21
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:21,000
i'm an associate called policy fellow at

22
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:22,830
the art institute<font color="#E5E5E5"> again a full rights on</font>

23
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,350
finland right now we're working on<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

24
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,100
project with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open knowledge finland</font>

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:30,720
chapter called my data so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm here</font>

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,979
because it's a relatively new concept we

27
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,600
just came out<font color="#E5E5E5"> the white paper and we're</font>

28
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:35,189
in development for the technical<font color="#E5E5E5"> side of</font>

29
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,658
things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm really looking for other</font>

30
00:01:35,189 --> 00:01:38,460
people who are working on similar work

31
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:47,000
you'd love to collaborate and we really

32
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:49,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">appreciate your feedback well um okay um</font>

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,720
so the project is called my data and

34
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:54,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's looking for a more human centric</font>

35
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:56,579
approach to how we organize our personal

36
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:58,560
data so as you all are well aware<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

37
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,719
<font color="#CCCCCC">now our</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> personal data online is</font>

38
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,909
scattered and collected and aggregated

39
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,219
by all sorts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different players by</font>

40
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,110
private companies by governments and

41
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:09,299
different sectors in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the health sector</font>

42
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,640
and transportation data by telecoms

43
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,200
there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of facts</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about you</font>

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,420
that are out there in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> State</font>

45
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">University eclectus metadata and as</font>

46
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,790
content and so the question is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

47
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,590
keep innovating and using the benefits

48
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,840
of having these big data aggregations

49
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,190
and keep moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> forward or the open data</font>

50
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,980
program said the government's running

51
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,480
but also how do people take back more

52
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,369
control or what's happening with their

53
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,410
data and actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the benefits of</font>

54
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:36,630
some of these innovations themselves and

55
00:02:34,410 --> 00:02:38,760
I would say right now we've almost feel

56
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:41,280
like Hercules trying to play the Hydra

57
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of going after one head and</font>

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,540
moving<font color="#CCCCCC"> up the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next to make you deal with</font>

59
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,250
how digital intermediaries handle your

60
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,929
data or you deal with you know maybe

61
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:50,519
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> Guillen next thing something or you</font>

62
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:53,310
do is a specific sector but we're

63
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:56,040
actually looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> a new framework that</font>

64
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:57,810
comes up with an actionable legal and

65
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,109
technical framework that kind of

66
00:02:57,810 --> 00:03:03,239
restructures eloping so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the</font>

67
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,070
principles<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my data the first thing as</font>

68
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned is other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human centric so</font>

69
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:08,670
the idea is that you have the right to

70
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:10,350
your data so everything that's being

71
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:12,000
collected you actually have the

72
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,910
possibility through a suite of 80 is

73
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,209
that ideally<font color="#CCCCCC"> will kind of exists on your</font>

74
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:20,010
personal<font color="#E5E5E5"> dashboard to recall that data</font>

75
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:22,290
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and download use it for your own</font>

76
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,540
purposes you're in<font color="#CCCCCC"> control so we're</font>

77
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,940
clear accessible useful terms of service

78
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:28,410
you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually which portions of your</font>

79
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:30,660
personal data you're handing over to

80
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:32,190
different bodies and you can control

81
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:34,769
what you're sharing and you're sharing

82
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:36,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">it with and of course</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> respects</font>

83
00:03:34,769 --> 00:03:39,510
rights to privacy we're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

84
00:03:36,989 --> 00:03:41,430
usability of data so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example right</font>

85
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:43,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">now you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do have legal rights to</font>

86
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">your personal data you can contact your</font>

87
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:48,420
mobile provider and you can ask<font color="#CCCCCC"> for all</font>

88
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,630
the data they've collected on you you'll

89
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:54,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably get it in a like sheet in about</font>

90
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:55,859
100 sheets of printed out paper that's

91
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:58,350
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> usable especially if you want</font>

92
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:00,540
to do new things with it so have them in

93
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:03,630
open formats using api's and using

94
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,510
interoperable standards and also looking

95
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,620
at a more open business environment

96
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:13,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving individuals consumers more choice</font>

97
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:15,630
over how they giving them data

98
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,399
portability so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is that you can</font>

99
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">download your data if you want it if</font>

100
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,209
you're using one thing we want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do so</font>

101
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,400
different

102
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:24,770
service can<font color="#CCCCCC"> cheap all the data that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

103
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:29,810
big has on you<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight then use it for you</font>

104
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:32,870
service so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> our little graphic</font>

105
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:34,639
kind of an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of how you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are at a</font>

106
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:37,520
center of<font color="#CCCCCC"> your personal Dean universe</font>

107
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:39,380
and then you can choose to mash of

108
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,049
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> data sets as they come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

109
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,460
through interoperable aight guys and

110
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:45,740
hopefully this will spur animations that

111
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,270
people actually create new applications

112
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:52,220
and services that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can reapply your</font>

113
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:54,080
personal advantage and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

114
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:56,120
really crucial component of indiscretion

115
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,310
when you're looking at this idea of your

116
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,919
identity online and who has control over

117
00:04:58,310 --> 00:05:03,229
it is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their own</font>

118
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:05,539
rich profiles data instead of companies

119
00:05:03,229 --> 00:05:07,460
or other organizations conducting

120
00:05:05,539 --> 00:05:09,080
implicit profiling and collecting

121
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:11,448
different paths type and then building

122
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,280
out your profile from there you're

123
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:15,080
actually filling out your own profile so

124
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,570
you're saying these are my preferences

125
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:19,400
and it is who<font color="#CCCCCC"> I am and used two types of</font>

126
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:21,229
services that i would like targeted at

127
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,060
me and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i actually think that provides a</font>

128
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,490
word which data set it lets people feel

129
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:27,560
were like they're in control over what's

130
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:33,050
going on as I mentioned data portability

131
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:35,539
is an important<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and so this these</font>

132
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:37,039
aren't just kinda sky dreams there's a

133
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:38,599
little white paper written on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

134
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,219
I'd like Charman my last slide and you

135
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:42,289
can find<font color="#E5E5E5"> it i tweeted it out this</font>

136
00:05:40,219 --> 00:05:44,840
powerpoint presentation it's in finished

137
00:05:42,289 --> 00:05:46,310
but we're translating it um so a lot of

138
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:48,830
the interrupt post standards were

139
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,630
looking at already<font color="#CCCCCC"> exists and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for people</font>

140
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,370
who are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> nervous about privacy</font>

141
00:05:50,630 --> 00:05:54,740
rights<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see data aggregation as a</font>

142
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:58,430
problem no matter what so even if you

143
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:00,440
put the individual as their correlation

144
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:02,150
point in the control point is<font color="#E5E5E5"> so this is</font>

145
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,750
problematic because of aggregating

146
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,729
everything there are already examples<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

147
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:10,009
systems that are interoperable but

148
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:12,080
they're not centralized for example when

149
00:06:10,009 --> 00:06:13,849
you use like a bank card it's an

150
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,409
interoperable system you can use a very

151
00:06:13,849 --> 00:06:17,210
carnet any machine that it will<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font>

152
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:19,699
right but that<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't mean that it's</font>

153
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,190
centralized so these<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some of the</font>

154

160
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:49,270
idea that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> activate your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

161
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,340
then one it will come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you in addition</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">to using and how you want people compute</font>

163
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,419
saying can we buy your data from you or

164
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,430
be of a studying medical study we want

165
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:59,830
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> your data can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you give it to us</font>

166
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:01,780
is the idea that people will argue you

167
00:06:59,830 --> 00:07:03,159
for your data and you will link the

168
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:11,349
decision about whether you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> share</font>

169
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:14,320
and what you want to share yes how do

170
00:07:11,350 --> 00:07:17,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">you make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that if your Savior fades</font>

171
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:22,060
or data that the kind of decisions that

172
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:24,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">people make are actually are actually</font>

173
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">sane decisions in terms of sharing that</font>

174
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,469
data as we know that you only very few

175
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:32,650
information for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on</font>

176
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:35,650
anonymized data set right<font color="#CCCCCC"> so the</font>

177
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:38,560
question of anonymity well one thing

178
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:39,880
that we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very concerned</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about their</font>

179
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,470
weakness really problematic and how

180
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:42,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">things work now is that oftentimes</font>

181
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:45,010
you're not notified if there's any

182
00:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,080
changes in terms of service or different

183
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,940
companies are selling data sets to each

184
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:51,870
other so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of this is that the</font>

185
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:55,810
whole thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is much more transparent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

186
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:57,910
feel like anonymity is less<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a problem</font>

187
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:00,820
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're choosing which data</font>

188
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:06,970
points people are accessing certain to

189
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:09,760
voluntarily well my question is more<font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

190
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:11,919
people important enough to know that if

191
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,229
they wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> give their postal code and</font>

192
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,919
their age that they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually telling</font>

193
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:20,760
who they are I don't know if they're

194
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,490
from enough that I guess they should be

195
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:26,530
so how do you take for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

196
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:31,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that this is actually a solution</font>

197
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:34,120
that is providing a system whereby

198
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,598
people can be anonymous that's that's

199
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:36,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">not the purpose</font>

200
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,950
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that an invidious possible but</font>

201
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:45,390
that's not the idea that all this data

202
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,040
is already out there and being collected

203
00:08:45,390 --> 00:09:17,310
so people should at least be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

204
00:08:47,040 --> 00:09:39,930
benefit from it thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay that is</font>

and i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> emphasize in the opposite</font>

that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is at this point still just an</font>

00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:43,970
idea in formation we have a website but

228
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:47,030
right now we have there's some pretty

229
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:49,130
much a placeholder the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> loader for</font>

230
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:50,800
future work and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to present</font>

231
00:10:49,130 --> 00:10:54,080
this idea to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your feedback</font>

232
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:56,420
when we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> concept and in</font>

233
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,070
particular to hear your ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what</font>

234
00:10:56,420 --> 00:11:00,800
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could do with this space and that</font>

235
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:02,900
would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> useful to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you so the humor in</font>

236
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:05,120
technology consortium I really are one

237
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,220
of a set of discussions that we have

238
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:09,650
about how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> could usefully partner up</font>

239
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:11,750
to support<font color="#CCCCCC"> advocacy at the intersection</font>

240
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:12,530
of Technology human rights and when we

241
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,420
realize is the part of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

242
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:16,850
conversations is that we were each

243
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:19,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">coming into the partnership with unique</font>

resources both Jay and I are in academic

246
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:27,200
scientists I work with human rights

00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:30,190
lawyers and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Human Rights scholars and</font>

00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,750
Enrique is located in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that advocacy and</font>

249
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:34,910
activist community and so we thought

250
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:36,530
that one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things we might do is</font>

251
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:39,760
think about building<font color="#CCCCCC"> bridges between</font>

252
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:43,280
each of those communities as a way of

253
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:46,189
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of activating and connecting the</font>

254
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,829
scientists and lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the scholars</font>

255
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:53,020
and academic institutions with the

256
00:11:48,830 --> 00:11:53,020
advocacy and activist communities
