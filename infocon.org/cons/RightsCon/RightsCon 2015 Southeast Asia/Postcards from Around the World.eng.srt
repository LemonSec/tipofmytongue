24
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,939
just start off by doing is doing a quick

25
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,319
like literally<font color="#CCCCCC"> just my name is and my</font>

26
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:07,599
country so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you get a sense of the</font>

27
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:09,458
geographical spread and you also get a

28
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,500
sense of like the names of the people

29
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,780
and their identities and maybe even if

30
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:18,459
you want to speaking on that in your

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,920

about our problems and there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">them as we've talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> throughout</font>

35
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:30,760
the day the<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus of this session</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

36
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,909
actually trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to frame it in terms of</font>

37
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:37,269
solutions in terms of what's working for

38
00:03:33,909 --> 00:03:41,918
many of us many of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

39
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:43,959
gathered here actually it can be a<font color="#E5E5E5"> day</font>

40
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">to day</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> struggle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and it can all and you</font>

41
00:03:43,959 --> 00:03:47,709
can feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like we're losing we're</font>

42
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:50,409
constantly losing the battle and we're

43
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:55,840
trying everything sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> radicals</font>

44
00:03:50,409 --> 00:03:58,060
sometimes conservatives sometimes policy

45
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,090
papers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to marches on the streets or</font>

46
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:02,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">online activism you name it whole range</font>

47
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:05,590
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> activities in order to</font>

48
00:04:02,829 --> 00:04:09,280
ensure the defense of the protection of

49
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:11,620
digital rights but what we're trying to

50
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,799
do is look at what's working and I think

51
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:16,659
often people here who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are often isolated</font>

52
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,250
in their own space not necessarily

53
00:04:16,659 --> 00:04:20,199
isolated but focused on their own space

54
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:21,579
it's also an opportunity I would love<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

55
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:24,039
have this almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a private round</font>

56
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:26,949
table as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well so that you guys can share</font>

57
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:28,930
and we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start off I mean</font>

58
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,760
after<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just do a quick hello we're</font>

60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:38,650

65
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,680
many many years related to that

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:52,000

96
00:06:15,159 --> 00:06:23,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">court right so this is about the better</font>

97
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:25,120
shield back in 2012 now set the

98
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:26,860
provisions of the IT Act of such that

99
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:30,490
you could get<font color="#CCCCCC"> arrested for three years</font>

100
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:33,310
if you send a message online would be

101
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:36,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">annoying or inconvenient when you like</font>

102
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:37,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">it the provision used so this was filed</font>

103
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:40,300
in 2012 and then there's another thing

104
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
that we had five<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two</font>

105
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">intermediately liability online so what</font>

106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,409
back then it provided for was that an

107
00:06:45,699 --> 00:06:49,960
intermediary would be mandated to take

108
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:53,110
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clinton on deceiving a complaint</font>

109
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:56,080
from any tire with a party Louise life

110
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:58,990
so we were walking with mouth shut calm

111
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,039
which is an intermediary linger it's so

112
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,260
it's a biggie website

113
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:04,420
and so we challenged the intermediary

114
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:06,310
liability rules and<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like he died</font>

115
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,860
like in our bag the Supreme Court<font color="#E5E5E5"> has</font>

116
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:10,180
declared both those provisions

117
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,640
unconstitutional and to be like down

118
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:14,680
completely so that's that great moon

119
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:18,130
coming from the end yuddam of expression

120
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:21,000
on that I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> underscore we're</font>

121
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:22,900
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a billion people in India</font>

122
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,490
subject to I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet</font>

123
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:26,500
population is a couple hundred million

124
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:29,560
talking talking about basically

125
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:33,280
offensive language could be taken down

126
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:36,100
and and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Endocyte offense if you be a</font>

127
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:38,169
few expressing offensive language online

128
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,790
then you can be prosecuted and there are

129
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:41,590
a number of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people currently detained as</font>

130
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:43,660
a result of that and then also the

131
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:45,909
intermediary liability issue here which

132
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:47,710
is a when is the platform responsible

133
00:07:45,910 --> 00:07:49,540
for the content both<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those provisions</font>

134
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:51,159
being knocked down is incredibly

135
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,620
significant for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundreds of millions</font>

136
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:55,630
of internet users<font color="#CCCCCC"> India and it's the</font>

137
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:59,160
interesting use of the court right we

138
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:01,540
haven't some of us we haven't actually

139
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:03,130
initiated actions but they haven't

140
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:05,470
necessarily gone to the Supreme Court

141
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:07,690
yeah and it can be<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> long and</font>

00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:12,910
involved process and as anyone else here

00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:15,070
using the courts and center so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we when</font>

00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:22,870
what we did was start by<font color="#E5E5E5"> writing a</font>

147
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:24,880
freedom of motion you know request to

148
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,410
government to basically say because the

149
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:28,030
government wasn't acknowledging that

150
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:30,070
they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing this it was an</font>

151
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:31,599
investigative report and they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

152
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:34,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to accept that they were</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it</font>

153
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,550
and so we sent that and our case was

154
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:39,010
struck out of the court because the

155
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:42,189
George used this phrase<font color="#CCCCCC"> useless word I</font>

156
00:08:39,010 --> 00:08:44,470
we're busy bodies and we had no you no

157
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,990
right to ask questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> but went back to</font>

158
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:49,600
court and i think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the success from</font>

159
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:52,060
the story is number one the<font color="#CCCCCC"> george was</font>

160
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">petitioned so this was a George would</font>

161
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,579
clearly was against<font color="#CCCCCC"> general expression</font>

162
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,439
and was leaning towards Security and

163
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:03,070
government and he was partitioned and

164
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,500
good thing is that the cases that is it

165
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,570
was involved after that had a more

166
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,340
neutral position because was very

167
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:11,680
careful because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we did cancel get that</font>

168
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,960
and the second thing is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

169
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:15,699
we're spinning so we we had

170
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,710
about two years when we were told to

171
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:19,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">wait and like I said it's a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

172
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:23,110
long process so now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> back in court</font>

173
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:25,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and if you sean has not been made in</font>

174
00:09:23,110 --> 00:09:28,090
fact we don't think it is wrong with me

175
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:30,310
very soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we're you know we have</font>

176
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">elections there 11 and so after that</font>

177
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:34,390
maybe would get it getting cold but what

178
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,729
it has done is it's put us in a new

179
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:38,710
position<font color="#E5E5E5"> that instead of asking the</font>

180
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:40,240
question or saying don't do this don't

181
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:42,880
do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we don't like this all the time</font>

182
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,010
we can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> be proactive and the</font>

183
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,380
side one wants to do so yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

184
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:49,990
want mass surveillance but what exactly

185
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:52,000
do we want and that led<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the work that</font>

186
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,490
we're doing now on the digital rights

187
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,530
and freedom feel for Nigeria so what

188
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:58,180
we've done as an organization is to work

189
00:09:56,530 --> 00:10:00,220
with other organizations and say hey

190
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,839
well we don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> this we don't want</font>

191
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:04,720
that but what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we want so what we want</font>

192
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,980
i will put together in a field<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

193
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:08,350
the deal the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> draft of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> deal was</font>

194
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,820
ready to go and what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> now is</font>

195
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,490
because waiting for the election so

196
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:14,980
whoever wins to go into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the National</font>

197
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Assembly will approach them and we're</font>

198
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,400
basically same to them guess what you

199
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:20,530
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to do any work we've done all</font>

200
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:22,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">the artwork we've written the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> view just</font>

201
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:24,010
take the credit right you know you're

202
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">the legislature who sponsored the</font>

203
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,360
digital rights and freedom feel foreign

204
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,860
land here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's very</font>

205
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:32,110
interested because we have people who

206
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:33,340
have said<font color="#E5E5E5"> our sponsor the deal but</font>

207
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:35,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're very careful because they have</font>

208
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:36,610
when they going to win I'm on every

209
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:39,310
level or not but if you have a few

210
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:41,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">people who might or might not win so if</font>

211
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:43,209
they win then we already have people who

212
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:47,880
already you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know so forget yet of</font>

213
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:47,880
positive rights and so because you know

214
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:53,890
you

215
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:11,869
they're everything very<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's great where</font>

216
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:15,169
you have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> song like that but it can be</font>

217
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:17,389
frustrating when you're told you is him

218
00:11:15,169 --> 00:11:19,459
party and you're told your kiss is going

219
00:11:17,389 --> 00:11:22,389
to happen in two years exactly one we

220
00:11:19,459 --> 00:11:22,388
have a chance to live

221
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:28,459
to a duel once it's already been asked

222
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,380
and today we too cute et cetera

223
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:32,689
or do we also have the opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

224
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:34,730
create the bill and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm really</font>

225
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:39,529
excited to hear that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's this like</font>

226
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:41,930
proactive step civil society not only

227
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:45,980
like lobbying legislative but actually

228
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:49,209
watching model legislation which is a

229
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:51,260
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> great thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in the US</font>

230
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:54,709
where we've been doing quite a lot of

231
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:57,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">the work as access we've also been in</font>

232
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:59,329
the development of these new cyber bills

233
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:00,349
information for us and trying to work

234
00:11:59,329 --> 00:12:01,969
within a committee and in the

235
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,399
legislative process to ensure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

236
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:09,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lords of the past create an environment</font>

237
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:14,420
in which you guys did you want to jump

238
00:12:09,769 --> 00:12:17,329
in on any other as you mentioned about

239
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:20,479
drafting our data related to cyber

240
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:31,479
constant government<font color="#E5E5E5"> has been working on</font>

241
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:31,480
us a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Bakr and let play ah the thick ah</font>

242
00:12:38,019 --> 00:12:45,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh it was like really driven and civil</font>

243
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:47,149
society<font color="#CCCCCC"> authorized they cooperated with</font>

244
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:50,350
international organizations like article

245
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:50,350
19 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philippines and ash</font>

246
00:12:52,740 --> 00:13:00,220
so they considered the recommendation

247
00:12:55,959 --> 00:13:02,439
and the drop because<font color="#E5E5E5"> society had</font>

248
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,209
concerns and the woman wants<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to work</font>

249
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,190
on its own right now the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

250
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:07,388
<font color="#E5E5E5">it was very it was a big successful</font>

251
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:11,199
thing that we work<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the</font>

252
00:13:07,389 --> 00:13:13,500
international oops like article 19 arm

253
00:13:11,199 --> 00:13:16,449
they did our capacity building and

254
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:19,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">analyze the law under the national under</font>

255
00:13:16,449 --> 00:13:23,170
the international standards but right

256
00:13:19,329 --> 00:13:26,339
now the thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um after a huge</font>

257
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,689
terrorist attack in Peshawar on a spool

258
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:32,290
government came up with the National

259
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:34,240
Action Plan of terrorism and they said

260
00:13:32,290 --> 00:13:36,880
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to consult any</font>

261
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:39,160
civil society for now the most

262
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,490
concerning thing for them is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> combat</font>

263
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:44,680
terrorism so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very you know and</font>

264
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:47,680
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's around the globe the trend</font>

265
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,930
to look into the laws dropped in the

266
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:53,199
laws under the international action

267
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:54,790
policies of terrorism so that that's the

268
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,160
challenge but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are solutions as</font>

269
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:58,209
well that we are working on it so it's

270
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:02,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting that we've talked about</font>

271
00:13:58,209 --> 00:14:03,430
judges a few time see as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

272
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,109
think what we're seeing is that the

273
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,899
judiciary actually don't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

274
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:11,019
the internet works fortunate to hear

275
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,670
that the Supreme Court really in India

276
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:15,399
don't have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of understanding</font>

277
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:16,660
certainly of the impact of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what these</font>

278
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:18,779
provisions mean in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital</font>

279
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:21,399
environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and in the offline world um</font>

280
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:23,439
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to add here that that's a</font>

281
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:26,019
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good precedent that that has been</font>

282
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,579
set by young Supreme Court for four

283
00:14:26,019 --> 00:14:30,579
neighboring countries like Pakistan

284
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:34,239
which actually copy pasted the entire IT

285
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:36,399
Act for our<font color="#CCCCCC"> cybercrime legislation and</font>

286
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,839
we really had a hard time to resist that

287
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:40,110
legislation so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a very</font>

288
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:43,300
good president said father yeah and

289
00:14:40,110 --> 00:14:45,880
actually a<font color="#CCCCCC"> rip well about what works in</font>

290
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:47,349
terms of civil society action because do

291

certain regions have great it in patent

293
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,500
act they set the standard for the region

294
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:57,490
and we've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the European context</font>

295
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:59,500
that you know the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection</font>

296
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:01,899
without a retention standards have been

297
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:04,000
copy and pasted throughout Africa for

298
00:15:01,899 --> 00:15:06,220

299
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,720

judicial education really important

304
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:26,740
process that we can undergo because

305
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:28,930
understanding to interpret legislation

306
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,880
depends on the prosecution and the

307
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,760
defense is to what's before them often

308
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,140
these judges are old and they need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

these people these young revolutionary

434
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,530
movements and then he laughed it off and

435
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,450
the whole room was laughing for a few

436
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:25,940
minutes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then you know a few months</font>

437
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">later it was those youth who supposedly</font>

438
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:29,360
brought down the regime not that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

439
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,219
has happened but that's what the

440
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:34,310
intention was<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think it was an</font>

441
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:37,730
indication of how the regime did not see

442
00:23:34,310 --> 00:23:39,800
them this internet as part of the of its

443
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:41,900
open policies open economic policies for

444
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,940
the international community to come to

445
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,710
and exploit<font color="#E5E5E5"> Egypt part of it was to</font>

446
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:50,390
build<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet infrastructure and they</font>

447
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:51,740
didn't see that the threat in giving a

448
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:53,930
voice to the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be able to</font>

449
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate that way that's not to say</font>

450
00:23:53,930 --> 00:23:57,020
that the social media<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what made</font>

451
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,459
revolution in Egypt

452
00:23:57,020 --> 00:24:00,530
Arab Spring like a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

453
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:02,150
saying that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

454
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:04,250
tool that they weren't<font color="#CCCCCC"> very aware of and</font>

455
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:07,250
then with time they start realizing that

456
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:08,750
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> very powerful and they started</font>

457
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:10,760
actually using it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because the</font>

458
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,740
counter-revolution across the Arab world

459
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,320
but particularly in Egypt is so

460
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:17,870
organized they know how to make use of

461
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:20,360
this technology to so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> to serve</font>

462
00:24:17,870 --> 00:24:22,399
their interests so even though it's us

463
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,990
young revolutionaries on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

464
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:26,120
they're the ones who are organized to

465
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:27,770
have proper pages who are communicating

466
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,209
we have proper surveillance I don't know

467
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,040
what they're doing and the coordinate

468
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:32,480
what's going on offline with online we

469
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">can talk all you want online and talk</font>

470
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:36,590
about how much we hate the system and an

471
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,700
insult the the leader and feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

472
00:24:36,590 --> 00:24:39,649
rebellious and stuff but we're not

473
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:42,830
getting much done without organization

474
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:45,350
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think right now that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't have</font>

475
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,580
this censorship on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet but we</font>

476
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:49,010
do have massive surveillance and

477
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:52,340
actually the Egyptian authorities had

478
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:56,090
put up to public a request for proposals

479
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:57,820
for IT companies around the world to

480
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:59,929
come and offer mass surveillance

481
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:02,960
solutions and that they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

482
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:03,620
choose the<font color="#CCCCCC"> best one out there and then</font>

483
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,030
we didn't hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> about what happened</font>

484
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:06,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">afterwards I mean they were just so</font>

485
00:25:05,030 --> 00:25:08,540
public about their<font color="#CCCCCC"> rfp and then they</font>

486
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:10,459
<font color="#CCCCCC">just went</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to this and no one heard again</font>

487
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:13,280
and and<font color="#CCCCCC"> while obviously</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> being monitored</font>

488
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:16,940
and and so obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> the situation now</font>

489
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:18,620
is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> slick is horrible because the</font>

490
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:20,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">counter-revolution is back all of our</font>

491
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:24,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">friends and and colleagues are in prison</font>

492
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,010
we have a military<font color="#E5E5E5"> dictator who was kind</font>

493
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,630
of the prodigy of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Guevara in power and</font>

494
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,700
we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem that the entire Arab</font>

495
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:34,760
world is facing is that either go<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

496
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,880
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> military and the brutal the brutal</font>

497
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:39,860
force or go with radical Islamists who

498
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,390
are just<font color="#E5E5E5"> as opportunists and are just</font>

499
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:42,740
aiming to be exactly like the military

500
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,050
in the brutal force and the

501
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:46,940
revolutionary movements are so weak and

502
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:49,790
non-existent that were actually left in

503
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:51,140
this binary system and we can't get out

504
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:56,090
of it so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> where we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are right now</font>

505
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:57,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay awesome that's really positive so</font>

506
00:25:56,090 --> 00:25:59,300
let's turn<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the audience we've</font>

507
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:00,949
obviously got a whole range of panelists

508
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:05,120
to get through I mean I want to talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

509
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:07,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Iran obviously when we talk about</font>

510
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:10,550
dictatorships and regimes and the

511
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,880
digital response and Hawaii as well from

512
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:17,720
the

513
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:19,970
who's experiencing who's<font color="#CCCCCC"> aaron</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> singh n</font>

514
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:21,020
any real<font color="#E5E5E5"> time let's see if there's any</font>

515
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:30,170
questions or any comments from the

516
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:32,150
audience just I have just one small

517
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:34,300
comment<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add with the regards to the</font>

518
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:38,840
judiciary and Egypt and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

519
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:40,490
education i'm sure will agree that it's

520
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">just not possible to educate the judges</font>

521
00:26:40,490 --> 00:26:47,390
because they are em you know elitist and

522
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:49,790
they do not accept<font color="#CCCCCC"> any anyone telling</font>

523
00:26:47,390 --> 00:26:51,860
them anything indeed so basically if you

524
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:54,139
want to teach a judge about the internet

525
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:56,479
and what it really does just going to be

526
00:26:54,140 --> 00:27:02,300
thrown out so that possibility isn't

527
00:26:56,480 --> 00:27:08,260
there i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pelican expect at</font>

528
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:11,030
this point um in the panel yeah yeah

529
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:13,760
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> i want to when I relate to think</font>

530
00:27:11,030 --> 00:27:16,760
about the how<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes to the car to</font>

531
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,650
educate judges so we've seen that into

532
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:21,260
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well but we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking like a more</font>

533
00:27:18,650 --> 00:27:23,780
broader approach and we say okay maybe

534
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,390
we're not going to give classes 12 12

535
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:28,580
judges but why not talking to young

536
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:31,340
lawyers while not talking to law

537
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:33,649
students to<font color="#CCCCCC"> jump professionals so we've</font>

538
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">been starting this this work it's really</font>

539
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:40,100
really as a small work join a class

540
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,260
after class introducing issues like

541
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:45,139
human rights the internet their ethics

542
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:49,220
and technology what lawyers or engineers

543
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:51,890
and we hope this will create like a

544
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:54,050
chain effect so in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future in 500</font>

545
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:55,610
years people in on Boone important

546
00:27:54,050 --> 00:27:57,860
positions we<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen civilized with</font>

547
00:27:55,610 --> 00:28:00,320
issues of the worker yeah so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea</font>

548
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:03,949
about investing in the future like how

549
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,899
do we prepare<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the future leaders</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

550
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,880
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we become future leaders and get in</font>

551
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,960
power influence future leaders and I

552
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,480
think we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this is this</font>

553
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,090
conference as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well as like many startups</font>

554
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:16,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">were here talking to the big companies</font>

555
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:17,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">the yahoos and Google's and trying to</font>

556
00:28:16,370 --> 00:28:20,000
get a sense of like when they create

557
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:23,000
their terms of service make it writes

558
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:24,530
respecting now when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> thousand</font>

559
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:26,060
users as opposed to when you have

560
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:28,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">10 million users because it's far more</font>

561
00:28:26,060 --> 00:28:30,830
difficult when you you know when you

562
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:33,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">have that kind of scale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and scope let's</font>

move to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Allie let's hear about the</font>

microphone from either side let's hear

565
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">about some of the challenges and some of</font>

566
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:41,750
the solutions in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the context of working</font>

567
00:28:39,980 --> 00:28:43,970
really with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in the context of</font>

568
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:47,570
the regime and as a diaspora as well

569
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:49,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">well I want to highlight that how do you</font>

570
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:52,639
know that Iranian Iran is on the Western

571
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,830
sanction and one other thing that work

together to explain to them that some of

577
00:29:02,870 --> 00:29:06,530
these sanctions didn't make sense some

578
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,389
of these services actually we're

579
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:12,560
limiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom special access</font>

580
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:15,070
information online so I small structures

581
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:18,770
that have we had last year last library

582
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,780
US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> came with exemptions for</font>

583
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:24,280
some of the sanctum and the other words

584
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:27,260
and governments in EU and Canada follow

585
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:31,420
fortunately he said they were exempted

586
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:34,790
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Sanctus and many companies reduce</font>

587
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:36,770
or stop over complying with these taxes

588
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,139
and many services are available to

589
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">Iranian Internet users like anywhere</font>

590
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:44,740
anyone else many of those sentences

591
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:47,360
simple things that we take for granted

592
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:49,220
so that's one positive development

593
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:52,310
another one which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> again in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> spirit</font>

positive people yeah so it's really

610
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:37,250
interesting here because what we've

611
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,100
gotta like digital activists who outside

612
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:40,470
of Iran

613
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,080
who are working together with activists

614
00:30:40,470 --> 00:30:45,030
inside of Iran I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to influence</font>

615
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:47,730
the tech sector with tech sector

616
00:30:45,030 --> 00:30:49,830
basically working within the<font color="#CCCCCC"> condition</font>

617
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">said to them by the US government these</font>

618
00:30:49,830 --> 00:30:54,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">US sanctions that were past that were</font>

619
00:30:51,809 --> 00:30:55,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">just so incredibly like negatively</font>

620
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,809
impacting the people they were trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

621
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:59,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">help as a result of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ali and a number of</font>

622
00:30:57,809 --> 00:31:02,309
other groups the US government<font color="#CCCCCC"> changed</font>

623
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:04,320
its policy enable personal communication

624
00:31:02,309 --> 00:31:07,110
services not to be caught up by the

625
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:08,370
sanction regime and then work very

626
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:11,100
closely with the tech companies like

627
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:13,830
Microsoft Google Twitter and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Yahoo say</font>

628
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:16,199
it's changed now you can now unlock your

629
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:17,520
services in Iran which means the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

630
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,309
on the streets of Iran are now using

631
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:22,350
Twitter Yahoo I mean using<font color="#CCCCCC"> sir</font>

632
00:31:20,309 --> 00:31:24,480
convention tools as well but using yahoo

633
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:27,809
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter etc ways that they weren't</font>

634
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:29,220
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do so so it's a victory</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean</font>

635
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,340
it actually is a victory and I think

636
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:33,690
we've seen some real movement and some

637
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:37,918
sense and certainly some appreciation

638
00:31:33,690 --> 00:31:41,669
from people within Iran um but a very

639
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:43,559
very very very long way to go I tell us

640
00:31:41,669 --> 00:31:46,400
about Vietnam and and what's working

641
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,379
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what's not well unfortunately</font>

642
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:53,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">Vietnam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is nowhere near India Pakistan</font>

643
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:57,750
or even Egypt or Tunisia we are very

644
00:31:53,270 --> 00:32:00,960
pre-revolution we only started having

645
00:31:57,750 --> 00:32:04,559
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephen society working together</font>

646
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,679
for years ago in 2011 and that was

647
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:12,149
thanks<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the rise of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's</font>

648
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:16,049
first and then income was getting bad in

649
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:18,929
Vietnam and therefore thanks to the rise

650
00:32:16,049 --> 00:32:22,470
of social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sifu society started</font>

651
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:26,429
developing Vietnamese do at an early

652
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:29,039
stage however there are a<font color="#CCCCCC"> few things</font>

653
00:32:26,429 --> 00:32:33,450
that I've been working or continued to

654
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,408
work I could just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say one simple thing</font>

655
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:40,380
that five years ago you<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't have</font>

656
00:32:36,409 --> 00:32:42,210
right now more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 activists from</font>

657
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:44,669
Vietnam sitting in this room being able

658
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:47,190
to leave it now whereas right now you do

659
00:32:44,669 --> 00:32:51,960
have more<font color="#E5E5E5"> than 10 activists from Vietnam</font>

660
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:54,540
coming over here and that was thanks to

661
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,300
not only the rise of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet so</font>

662
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:59,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">people know more about their rights and</font>

663
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:02,399
therefore they have left less fear but

664
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:05,820
also it connects people social media

665
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:09,540
connects<font color="#E5E5E5"> people so now there's a</font>

666
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:13,470
situation<font color="#E5E5E5"> where in Vietnam most of our</font>

667
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:17,370
activities are<font color="#E5E5E5"> done online whether it is</font>

668
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:20,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">from political prisoner family making a</font>

669
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:24,090
visit and then posting the the visit and

670
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:26,430
the harassment that they they meet right

671
00:33:24,090 --> 00:33:31,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">online and then so everyone then can</font>

672
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:34,320
follow in terms of figure for example

673
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:38,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now Vietnam</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> has about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 90 million</font>

674
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,220
people but we've got 30 million<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet</font>

675
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:43,050
users and out of those 30 million

676
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:46,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet users we have about 20 million</font>

677
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:50,120
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> using facebook so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

678
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:57,149
becomes a very effective tool for

679
00:33:50,120 --> 00:34:00,120
activists to not only post their

680
00:33:57,150 --> 00:34:02,760
thoughts but also where they rally for a

681
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:04,110
common cause of course the count the

682
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:06,030
government tries to control and

683
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:08,069
surveillance and persecute people for

684
00:34:06,030 --> 00:34:10,889
that but it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> continue to rise it</font>

685
00:34:08,070 --> 00:34:13,200
rises<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to a point where now even the</font>

686
00:34:10,889 --> 00:34:15,870
government has to use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook so for</font>

687
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:18,629
example the minister of health now has a

688
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:22,350
paste facebook page and and thanks to

689
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:24,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> therefore unlike in China where</font>

690
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:27,389
they can effectively closed down

691
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:30,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook and use an alternative where</font>

692
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:33,060
they can control the content in Vietnam

693
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:36,900
they can't if it rises over that tipping

694
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,090
point so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that is a great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

695
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:42,320
that is working<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now and because of</font>

696
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the online</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activities that are so</font>

697
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:50,460
vigorous and so I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> so active it</font>

698
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:52,860
feels<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> activities so the</font>

699
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:56,040
online activities supports the offline

700
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:58,980
activities for example two days ago

701
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:04,020
hanoi city decided that they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

702
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:05,830
cut down<font color="#E5E5E5"> 6700 trees in hanoi well people</font>

703
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:08,440
went on social media

704
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,350
facebook said not that's wrong and guess

705
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,660
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> within like two days 500 people</font>

706
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:16,810
went down<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the street first time ever</font>

707
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:19,509
for a course like that have<font color="#E5E5E5"> people go</font>

708
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:22,750
down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the street to protest unheard of in</font>

709
00:35:19,510 --> 00:35:26,200
Vietnam but guess<font color="#E5E5E5"> what be there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

710
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:29,230
Communist Party chief of Hanoi had to

711
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:32,230
stop that policy after like two thousand

712
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:34,480
trees being cut so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is all online</font>

713
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:37,120
activities that forces the government to

714
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:39,490
listen but thats moves out to the

715
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:41,560
offline activities so those things are

716
00:35:39,490 --> 00:35:43,390
working and it also working because then

717
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:45,820
people get to know more we have 4

718
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:47,680
million overseas with amazed who then

719
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:49,960
can help connect with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Vietnamese</font>

720
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:51,970
from inside the country and bring them

721
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:53,800
out here for training and for other

722
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:56,049
activities for advocacy purposes

723
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:58,720
possible Ally let's hear affecting you

724
00:35:56,050 --> 00:36:01,390
about I mean we saw obama and rouhani

725
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,680
like tweeting at each other and like how

726
00:36:01,390 --> 00:36:08,049
important is the digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> space for</font>

727
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,580
offline social change begin Iran is it

728
00:36:08,050 --> 00:36:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually is there a connection there</font>

729
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:17,620
online<font color="#E5E5E5"> so like online action like these</font>

730
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,900
kind of examples of why talks about

731
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,940
where you've got you know people were

732
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:23,350
activating online they can stop those

733
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:26,410
trees from being chopped down in the

734
00:36:23,350 --> 00:36:29,350
middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of I don't I think the best</font>

735
00:36:26,410 --> 00:36:31,350
example is probably 2009 contested

736
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:34,240
election that the Iranians used like

737
00:36:31,350 --> 00:36:38,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">Vietnamese and like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Egyptian</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> certain</font>

738
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:40,600
they use social media to mobilize and to

739
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:45,490
organize them<font color="#CCCCCC"> Falls and spilled over</font>

740
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:47,650
from online we do this week<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I can</font>

741
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:50,470
the offline space we can vary<font color="#CCCCCC"> buying it</font>

742
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:54,070
and also the online space the our

743
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:58,020
targets were also smart in way of using

744
00:36:54,070 --> 00:37:02,530
that space to identify people so I think

745
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:06,940
it had a pampering<font color="#E5E5E5"> tech and speed slow</font>

746
00:37:02,530 --> 00:37:09,400
down on everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

747
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,350
positive or negative but I I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just want</font>

748
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:14,620
to highlight that although all these

749
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:17,200
platforms are officially sensitive on

750
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook through many people use it and</font>

751
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,930
also Iranian officials are on

752
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:24,520
platform for example Iran's mr. find

753
00:37:22,930 --> 00:37:27,879
their peers has a verified Twitter

754
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,550
account so that's another double

755
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:32,860
standard that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> political elite keep</font>

756
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:34,540
themselves access to this platform to

757
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:37,720
reach out but they don't let the

758
00:37:34,540 --> 00:37:41,590
ordinary Iranians I back and had a

759
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:44,620
Iranians respond to that inconsistency

760
00:37:41,590 --> 00:37:48,010
from one of the better word many people

761
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:49,509
are online but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to pay</font>

762
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:52,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">attention if they want to come online</font>

763
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:54,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">they have uses accommodation to the ends</font>

764
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,910
are very popular so they have to pay for

765
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:59,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">that so I mean yes from outside we see</font>

766
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:01,930
the ones who come online but I'm use

767
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:04,450
Twitter and Facebook but probably a lot

768
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:08,589
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people cannot afford to pay for a VPN</font>

769
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:10,240
on a monthly basis to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> access to a</font>

770
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:12,430
lot of that work that you do is actually

771
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:14,080
connected to this it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> like how do</font>

772
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:19,950
people get online and how do they get

773
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:19,950
online safely tell us about that yeah so

774
00:38:20,130 --> 00:38:25,960
thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> being patient as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

775
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,310
yeah so I just just a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

776
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:29,980
background about something that happened

777
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:32,200
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> India recently uh in December last</font>

778
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:35,380
year of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ministry of communications</font>

779
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:37,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I to you in India phosphor about</font>

780
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:39,370
attitude a secret order to every single

781
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:42,970
internet service licensing in the

782
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:45,279
country and ask them to block 31<font color="#E5E5E5"> URLs</font>

783
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:50,140
and some of them were popular websites

784
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:57,220
such as github com vimeo com the emotion

785
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:59,859
faced him um and this was issued after<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

786
00:38:57,220 --> 00:39:03,100
police complaint that said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

787
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:08,730
platforms were working you to incite

788
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:12,880
terrorism in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the country um talk about</font>

789
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:14,080
yeah so if there's a lot of campaigning

790
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,000
going on climate change legislation

791
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:19,180
today we are all really celebrated

792
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,100
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the 66 especially the</font>

793
00:39:19,180 --> 00:39:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">patient et cetera</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Indian idea I'd being</font>

794
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:24,549
struck down by the supreme court I can

795
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:27,569
do a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit of background about what</font>

796
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an active seventh minute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but um</font>

797
00:39:27,570 --> 00:39:32,170
I think what's important is that there

798
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,070
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> really very little transparency in</font>

799
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:36,670
terms of how

800
00:39:33,070 --> 00:39:38,620
how come you<font color="#E5E5E5"> typically implemented or</font>

801
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:42,010
conducted and something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did</font>

802
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">after the block in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> December is a did a</font>

803
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,330
lot of technical analysis in India<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

804
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:49,240
publish a lot of these sensitive reports

805
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:50,529
it is kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> and because there is no</font>

806
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:52,359
transcript it's important that

807
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:56,020
technologists can get<font color="#E5E5E5"> involved and fine</font>

808
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:59,710
look at how different title it does to

809
00:39:56,020 --> 00:40:01,750
think if one helps us create well create

810
00:39:59,710 --> 00:40:03,820
more data sets about what is being

811
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:06,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">censored how is being censored what kind</font>

812
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:08,280
of inconsistencies<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist across is peace</font>

813
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:11,710
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country when there is no</font>

814
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">standardized way for comment or the</font>

815
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:20,050
judiciary to ask for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a takedown or or</font>

816
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:21,190
specify order the censorship so it's

817
00:40:20,050 --> 00:40:24,930
important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and collect this data</font>

818
00:40:21,190 --> 00:40:27,160
were also as to developers it helps us

819
00:40:24,930 --> 00:40:29,589
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell convention tools better</font>

820
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,120
actually understand what time the petals

00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:33,370
in touch it gives be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

822
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,049
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually get around it um there</font>

823
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:38,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">are some amazing tools which basically</font>

824
00:40:35,050 --> 00:40:40,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">build it you bypass pretty much any sort</font>

827
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:51,250
probably a tour and it's a and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found</font>

838
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:25,960
that is here but essentially it's a

839
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,660
circumvention and anonymity tool that

840
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:30,760
enables you to browse the internet and

841
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,890
to communicate online without being

<font color="#E5E5E5">try to recommend those tools especially</font>

852
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:17,500

855
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:31,870
awareness about all those yes these are

856
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:33,040

case and see whether we can take some

859
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:46,180
lessons from it yes so yeah today's<font color="#E5E5E5"> lamb</font>

860
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:48,370
our judgment<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's making</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us really happy</font>

861
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:50,500
because some one of the sections of the

862
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:54,190
IT Act that was shut down is a version

863

<font color="#CCCCCC">called 66a in the face of it this that's</font>

864
00:42:54,190 --> 00:43:00,340

984
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:06,270
mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a couple of points</font>

985
00:49:04,559 --> 00:49:08,730
that have been raised there that are

986
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:10,200
worth highlighting and one is I just

987
00:49:08,730 --> 00:49:13,410
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay tribute to the point that</font>

988
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:15,480
you made about a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work was done to</font>

989
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:18,029
try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> influence the US government with</font>

990
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:20,130
its sanctions on Iran the general

991
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,829
license was issued and then the Iranian

992
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:25,589
community helped to influence the US

993
00:49:22,829 --> 00:49:27,780
policy with respect to Sudan and the

994
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:30,058
Sudan community was successful and

995
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:32,160
helped to lobby the US government on

996
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:34,500
Cuba and I think that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of inter</font>

997
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:37,319
group solidarity can be a really

998
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:41,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">effective tool if you want to jump in on</font>

any<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that also with respect to the</font>

one person and it was Nicole Wong who is

1009
00:50:07,589 --> 00:50:11,819
actually i think the other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't know</font>

1010
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,859
she works in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> White House issues the</font>

1012
00:50:13,859 --> 00:50:18,720
wrote back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me and I was like oh</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1013
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:20,430
god i just got an email from google<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1014
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,828
now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think we see this is every day</font>

1015
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:24,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">like we have like their departments</font>

1016
00:50:22,829 --> 00:50:26,609
within these tech companies that are now

1017
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:28,140
understand the<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights implications</font>

1018
00:50:26,609 --> 00:50:29,970
of their platforms

1019
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:32,520
that is a relatively new thing and it's

1020
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:34,290
a great thing so again I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

1021
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:35,340
progress it is a long way to go as I

1022
00:50:34,290 --> 00:50:38,610
mentioned there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are many tech companies</font>

1023
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:40,770
who are not here but now we are<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing</font>

1024
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:43,310
progress within the tech companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1025
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:45,720
they respond to us when we have concerns

1026
00:50:43,310 --> 00:50:47,279
we've seen their over compliance on<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1027
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:49,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">sanctions for instance but they also</font>

1028
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:51,030
here to discuss<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us and hear what</font>

1029
00:50:49,890 --> 00:50:53,160
are the issues that people are facing

1030
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:54,750
for example real name policy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1031
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:56,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook is an issue that's still very</font>

1032
00:50:54,750 --> 00:51:02,390
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> light will be discussed</font>

1033
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:08,460
continuously this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conference on it stops</font>

1034
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:11,759
yeah well the preferred solution I think

1035
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:15,150
as I said before we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> your I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> raised</font>

1036
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:22,280
the people or NIST about physical and

1037
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:25,410
risk physical and moral<font color="#E5E5E5"> risks related to</font>

1038
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:32,360
privacy security because there is a

1039
00:51:25,410 --> 00:51:37,080
relation between those two points and

1040
00:51:32,360 --> 00:51:40,380
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have two actors like internet</font>

1041
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:44,390
users and government for the government

1042
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:50,640
but the government we should I think

1043
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:57,180
push and make pressure for example by

1044
00:51:50,640 --> 00:52:03,049
making online pressure or<font color="#CCCCCC"> our try into</font>

1045
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:07,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">who critical part c litigate some</font>

1046
00:52:03,050 --> 00:52:10,380
Tunisian parliament members to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

1047
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:15,540
digital human rights defenders so they

1048
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:21,810
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us to write new digital rights</font>

1049
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:27,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">laws and at the same time need to work</font>

1050
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:34,350
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet users by letting them know</font>

1051
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:36,840
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> their digital rights which they</font>

1052
00:52:34,350 --> 00:52:41,930
wished which<font color="#CCCCCC"> digital rights they have</font>

1053
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:47,710
and they should head for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example can</font>

1054
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:47,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">mansion natural tea and open Internet</font>

1055
00:52:47,829 --> 00:53:00,010
also I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> should let people know how</font>

1056
00:52:54,890 --> 00:53:05,930
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use their devices with pure way and</font>

1057
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:09,400
how can how they can be anonymous and

1058
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:13,819
the internet and unclip their

1059
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:18,800
communication because here there is like

1060
00:53:13,819 --> 00:53:21,619
a mass of internet surveillance and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

1061
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,790
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter that thanks very much I</font>

1062
00:53:21,619 --> 00:53:24,410
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick up on the issue of</font>

1063
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:27,109
terrorism because it's being<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned</font>

1064
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:29,480
four or five times they got well how

1065
00:53:27,109 --> 00:53:31,700
what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the solution to this problem I</font>

1066
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:35,809
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're seeing it everywhere how do</font>

1067
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:38,058
<font color="#E5E5E5">we actually work towards the respect for</font>

1068
00:53:35,809 --> 00:53:41,380
freedom<font color="#E5E5E5"> of expression privacy and</font>

00:53:38,059 --> 00:53:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Association online in the context of</font>

1070
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:45,349
counterterrorism which is being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1071
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,900
governments across the world and

1072
00:53:45,349 --> 00:53:49,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">particularly in your country I don't</font>

1073
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,280
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i don't i don't see anything</font>

1074
00:53:49,609 --> 00:53:55,730
you should do it right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now because in</font>

1075
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:58,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">Pakistan this narrative around national</font>

1076
00:53:55,730 --> 00:53:59,480
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and terrorism and I can see in</font>

1077
00:53:58,010 --> 00:54:03,140
other countries as well it's actually

1078
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:06,619
increasing and I would like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1079
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:09,200
about the role of companies when these

1080
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:11,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments send them a takedown</font>

1081
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,290
requests and asking for users data they

1082
00:54:11,960 --> 00:54:18,440
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> cite national security and</font>

1083
00:54:15,290 --> 00:54:20,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">entire anti-terrorism policies and these</font>

1084
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,510
companies most of the companies comply

1085
00:54:20,420 --> 00:54:25,940
to them but I think the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> solution i</font>

1086
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:28,069
see is to interact more with these

1087
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:30,380
companies and I think these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1088
00:54:28,069 --> 00:54:32,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">rights phone and the other conferences</font>

1089
00:54:30,380 --> 00:54:34,040
these are the spaces where digital

1090
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,290
rights<font color="#E5E5E5"> activists and organizations</font>

1091
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:37,460
working on internet freedom I mean they

1092
00:54:36,290 --> 00:54:40,609
can interact with them and tell them

1093
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:43,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">that what actually they mean by ramilo</font>

1094
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:46,250
and national security<font color="#CCCCCC"> and terrorism and</font>

1095
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:48,230
most of the time they say that it's a

1096
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:50,569
blasphemous content and in Pakistan we

1097
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:53,210
have seen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook lot of pages</font>

1098
00:54:50,569 --> 00:54:56,200
were removed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the company because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1099
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:58,990
was the political content and by the

1100
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">activist</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and descendants so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1101
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important to interact with these</font>

1102
00:55:00,820 --> 00:55:04,990
companies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Union</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know their</font>

1103
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:07,210
policy teams that what actually

1104
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:10,000
government mean when they cite these

1105
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:12,220
laws are up but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a growing and</font>

1106
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,250
increasing narrative which is like we

1107
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:17,200
feel really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to tell them yeah I</font>

1108
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to add add to that in Egypt in</font>

1109
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:22,480
the 90s the word terrorism was very

1110
00:55:20,260 --> 00:55:23,920
widespread was used by the media lot and

1111
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,410
obviously back in the 90s you still

1112
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:29,710
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have internet and regular</font>

1113
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:31,420
landline TV which everyone got had the

1114
00:55:29,710 --> 00:55:34,210
same rhetoric and it was very controlled

1115
00:55:31,420 --> 00:55:35,740
very centralized now after the

1116
00:55:34,210 --> 00:55:37,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">Revolution</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> after the Muslim Brotherhood</font>

1117
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:40,810
were ousted by military coup and they're

1118
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:42,490
all thrown<font color="#CCCCCC"> in prison this terminology is</font>

1119
00:55:40,810 --> 00:55:44,650
back again and a lot of Egyptians are

1120
00:55:42,490 --> 00:55:47,109
sucking it up and it's true however i

1121
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:49,599
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we with the authorities will never</font>

1122
00:55:47,109 --> 00:55:51,009
serve us we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> never get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the point</font>

1123
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:53,859
where they're going to do<font color="#CCCCCC"> us a favor</font>

1124
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,390
there if you want our rights we're going

1125
00:55:53,859 --> 00:55:58,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">to be doing pressuring them and they're</font>

1126
00:55:55,390 --> 00:56:00,640
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be doing it it's despite the</font>

1127
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:02,380
fact that they don't want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it now I</font>

1128
00:56:00,640 --> 00:56:06,040
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> the best way to get rid of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1129
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:07,839
obviously is to to empty this word of

1130
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:09,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">meeting so that it no longer has any</font>

1131
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:11,259
meaning for the people so when they say

1132
00:56:09,460 --> 00:56:12,310
terrorism<font color="#E5E5E5"> is like all else it's</font>

1133
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:15,099
it's what they're saying all the time

1134
00:56:12,310 --> 00:56:16,660
does it mean anything so in that sense

1135
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:18,190
while we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're</font>

1136
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">trying to reach out to the people and to</font>

1137
00:56:18,190 --> 00:56:23,200
say hey<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have the military who is</font>

1138
00:56:21,339 --> 00:56:24,970
throwing<font color="#CCCCCC"> up on Prison is cracking down</font>

1139
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:26,828
there raising prices they're controlling

1140
00:56:24,970 --> 00:56:28,540
the economy in the ministries we have no

1141
00:56:26,829 --> 00:56:30,670
freedom whatsoever and then you have the

1142
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:32,259
Islamists or just like them just like

1143
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:33,760
beards right and those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the two</font>

1144
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:35,650
groups they have available how about

1145
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,680
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm talking about minimum wage</font>

1146
00:56:35,650 --> 00:56:41,230
about progressive taxation on the rich

1147

1153
00:56:50,589 --> 00:56:53,560
controlled by a small group of

1154
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,730
businessmen we can't get access to the

1155
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:56,980

00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:01,420
controlled by millionaires who are

1159
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:03,760
siding with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the military for obvious</font>

1160
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:06,460
reasons however<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I hate the sound</font>

like<font color="#CCCCCC"> orientalist but the social media is</font>

1162
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:11,660
a platform like Facebook at least the

1163
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,850
is a platform that we can use we have 25

1164

elections purely by Facebook campaigns

1170
00:57:25,850 --> 00:57:31,400

00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,700
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook's a private company which</font>

1244
01:00:06,200 --> 01:00:11,000
that yes there's terrorism there's poker

1245
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:13,310
online or not so let's let's do the

1246
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:16,190
things one to do so we've got a chance

1247
01:00:13,310 --> 01:00:19,580
the good thing is we knew they were

1248
01:00:16,190 --> 01:00:21,350
coming and so we measure when the room

1249
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:23,509
when the composition was happening and

1250
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,520
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time where the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> National Assembly</font>

1251
01:00:23,510 --> 01:00:28,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">and the conversation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> went towards</font>

1252
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,400
terrorism we also talked about rights

1253
01:00:28,220 --> 01:00:32,870
and one thing I was up for was that when

1254
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:35,240
the conversation was<font color="#E5E5E5"> always about</font>

1255
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:38,180
terrorism they thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> asked government</font>

1256
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:40,069
people who would always be there when

1257
01:00:38,180 --> 01:00:42,290
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> point it out to them that if you</font>

1258
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:44,540
start mass surveillance today when

1259
01:00:42,290 --> 01:00:46,759
you're no<font color="#CCCCCC"> longer the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> president or when</font>

1260
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:48,770
you're no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> a politician you will</font>

1261
01:00:46,760 --> 01:00:50,450
be a subject of surveillance you should

1262
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:53,000
see the<font color="#E5E5E5"> reaction on their faces because</font>

1263
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:54,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">they literally go like wow this is that</font>

1264
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:56,600
going to happen and that has been a been

1265
01:00:54,770 --> 01:00:59,630
a bit of cool enough in the conversation

1266
01:00:56,600 --> 01:01:02,930
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> 44 countries in transition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1267
01:00:59,630 --> 01:01:04,970
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the time not to allow anyone to</font>

1268
01:01:02,930 --> 01:01:06,620
blackmail you Lucien<font color="#CCCCCC"> elite because the</font>

1269
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:08,330
thing was always that when you had any

1270
01:01:06,620 --> 01:01:11,120
conversation people ask me questions

1271
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:13,130
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a lot of terrorists and and</font>

1272
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:14,720
the I think it's important to push back

1273
01:01:13,130 --> 01:01:16,970
and say this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation about</font>

1274
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,640
me supporting terrorists but it's about

1275
01:01:16,970 --> 01:01:21,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a two-way conversation yes there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1276
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">security you know question and this is</font>

1277
01:01:21,710 --> 01:01:25,130
good conversation but at the same time

1278
01:01:23,270 --> 01:01:28,730
there is the fact that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1279
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:30,590
constitutional right to my privacy so

1280
01:01:28,730 --> 01:01:31,930
we've we've got a chance to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1281
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:34,640
kind of conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font>

1282
01:01:31,930 --> 01:01:36,330
unfortunately it's it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> to Ted not watch</font>

1283
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:37,650
government so we

1284
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:40,259
we had the original<font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting recently</font>

1285
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:41,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">where someone from the government ghana</font>

1286
01:01:40,260 --> 01:01:43,860
you know by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way which is seen as</font>

1287
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,810
more open than many other governments in

1288
01:01:43,860 --> 01:01:48,840
the region actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1289
01:01:45,810 --> 01:01:51,990
security and said if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have nothing to</font>

1290
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:54,150
be afraid of why are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> so worried</font>

1291
01:01:51,990 --> 01:01:56,089
about you limited freedom my response

1292
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:59,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">was very simple if there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no agenda</font>

1293
01:01:56,090 --> 01:02:01,860
then why<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so concerned if I would</font>

1294
01:01:59,370 --> 01:02:04,230
openly protect the kind of things I<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

1295
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the name of security and as also i</font>

1296
01:02:04,230 --> 01:02:07,650
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's some countries like</font>

1297
01:02:05,790 --> 01:02:10,320
nigeria others that have the chance of

1298
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:12,090
having this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation right now but</font>

1299
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,910
reality is the conversation<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

1300
01:02:12,090 --> 01:02:17,280
security and rights and freedom is not

1301
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:19,170
balanced in fact what we need to do is

1302
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:21,720
to have a lot more<font color="#E5E5E5"> conversation around</font>

1303
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:24,000
rights and freedoms to<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have</font>

1304
01:02:21,720 --> 01:02:25,770
anything close to balance in this little

1305
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,850
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of sweet conversation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean i</font>

1306
01:02:25,770 --> 01:02:28,050
mentioned this before in the

1307
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:30,450
government's meeting that happened

1308
01:02:28,050 --> 01:02:32,400
earlier today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that in many</font>

1309
01:02:30,450 --> 01:02:34,770
governments that decisions are still

1310
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:37,020
being made like we think about I mean

1311
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:39,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">some governments its it is kind of</font>

1312
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:41,940
monolithic perhaps in Vietnam and<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

1313
01:02:39,570 --> 01:02:44,520
but they still like progressives they're

1314
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:46,200
still moderates even in actually in Iran

1315
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,520
and Vietnam so decisions are being made

1316
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,009
and then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are also distinctions</font>

1317
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:51,930
between like agencies as well so

1318
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:54,330
sometimes we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been in meetings where</font>

1319
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:55,740
we sit with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who is</font>

1320
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,049
responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for human rights and the</font>

1321
01:02:55,740 --> 01:03:00,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">person who is responsible for cyber and</font>

1322
01:02:58,050 --> 01:03:02,280
those two people often have never met

1323
01:03:00,060 --> 01:03:04,470
each other that's often the person who's

1324
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:06,870
the cyber guy who's like and is

1325
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:08,759
generally a man who's like got all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1326
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:11,970
arguments and got all the statistics and

1327
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:13,560
is able to like basically obliterate the

1328
01:03:11,970 --> 01:03:15,600
human rights person or the human<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights</font>

1329
01:03:13,560 --> 01:03:18,299
advocate often it's a debate within

1330
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:20,279
government as to get getting before<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

1331
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:21,960
get to that policy I really take your

1332
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:23,820
point about transitional<font color="#CCCCCC"> States or</font>

1333
01:03:21,960 --> 01:03:26,430
transition like we are at a moment of

1334
01:03:23,820 --> 01:03:28,440
transition there are norms that are

1335
01:03:26,430 --> 01:03:30,899
being<font color="#CCCCCC"> built right now in all of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our</font>

1336
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:32,790
countries even in Australia where I'm

1337
01:03:30,900 --> 01:03:34,320
from we're seeing government the

1338
01:03:32,790 --> 01:03:39,990
government making decisions on data

1339
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:41,190
retention absolutely like crazy and it's

1340
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,040
all again in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the name of national</font>

1341
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,410
security and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the protection of borders</font>

1342
01:03:44,040 --> 01:03:50,190
etc but those decisions are<font color="#E5E5E5"> being made</font>

1343
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:53,160
right now and I am then I'm really

1344
01:03:50,190 --> 01:03:55,350
glad to hear<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because I</font>

1345
01:03:53,160 --> 01:03:57,629
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what with what we need is</font>

1346
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:02,700
good argument like we actually need

1347
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:05,130
really smart good incisive argument face

1348
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:06,870
that's cuts upset on data as well like

1349
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:10,020
we need data we need information which

1350
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:11,370
actually identifies what is taking place

1351
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:12,960
in the t2 environment what sort of

1352
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:14,850
censorship there is and then to be able

1353
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:18,120
to provide<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as part of our arguments</font>

1354
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:20,160
so that we can tip the balance so let's

1355
01:04:18,120 --> 01:04:23,850
move to a beer because your balance is

1356
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">the balances undecided in Tunisia as</font>

1357
01:04:23,850 --> 01:04:27,360
well you mentioned<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have and I</font>

1358
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:28,920
think this<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation is somewhat</font>

1359
01:04:27,360 --> 01:04:30,990
turning to terrorism but I'm I'm pleased

1360
01:04:28,920 --> 01:04:33,270
that it is because I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that we do</font>

1361
01:04:30,990 --> 01:04:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> like the defining feature I</font>

1362
01:04:33,270 --> 01:04:36,750
think when<font color="#E5E5E5"> we looked at what happened</font>

1363
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:39,120
after Charlie Hebdo you know one hand

1364
01:04:36,750 --> 01:04:40,680
you had all of this the heads of state

1365
01:04:39,120 --> 01:04:42,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">walking down the street arm in arm</font>

1366
01:04:40,680 --> 01:04:43,770
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> freedom of expression and</font>

1367
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:46,230
at the same time they're instant

1368
01:04:43,770 --> 01:04:48,870
shooting counterterrorism laws through

1369
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:51,030
the parliaments so like how do we get to

1370
01:04:48,870 --> 01:04:53,700
this point where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we tip on the side of</font>

1371
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:56,190
rights as a place on the side of terror

1372
01:04:53,700 --> 01:05:01,890
of counterterrorism any perspective in

1373
01:04:56,190 --> 01:05:06,120
this final round yeah i think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1374
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:11,339
government always use terrorism excuse

1375
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:17,089
our argument for survive<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1376
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:22,500
then we need a institution<font color="#CCCCCC"> like control</font>

1377
01:05:17,090 --> 01:05:31,350
every life surveillance the government

1378
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:34,800
are are like try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make for our target</font>

1379
01:05:31,350 --> 01:05:40,560
like we need some control someone

1380
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:44,930
control those surveillances because if

1381
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:51,740
we stay here just<font color="#E5E5E5"> listening about</font>

1382
01:05:44,930 --> 01:05:56,450
surveillance without doing anything like

1383
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:59,220
the things are going to be like the far

1384
01:05:56,450 --> 01:06:01,049
you know and<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to pick up on that i</font>

1385
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:03,598
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this idea banger which you</font>

1386
01:06:01,050 --> 01:06:05,220
mentioned before about

1387
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,779
infrastructure basically<font color="#CCCCCC"> all you're</font>

1388
01:06:05,220 --> 01:06:09,269
saying is we're creating a surveillance

1389
01:06:06,779 --> 01:06:10,680
infrastructure it can be<font color="#E5E5E5"> used against</font>

1390
01:06:09,269 --> 01:06:12,209
you once this surveillance

1391
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,669
infrastructure is in place whether it be

1392
01:06:12,210 --> 01:06:17,609
legally or technically we're in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> place</font>

1393
01:06:14,670 --> 01:06:23,729
where it's extremely<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard to roll with</font>

1394
01:06:17,609 --> 01:06:27,930
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need like legal tix our noise</font>

1395
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:33,229
about those actions that the government

1396
01:06:27,930 --> 01:06:39,779
are making we need laws to protect the

1397
01:06:33,229 --> 01:06:43,649
internet users activist so so we can the

1398
01:06:39,779 --> 01:06:52,589
pants it's a government try to like Jade

1399
01:06:43,650 --> 01:07:01,559
someone so we need like focusing a lot

1400
01:06:52,589 --> 01:07:04,739
of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> things and and trying to build</font>

1401
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:06,089
strategies like you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finish up on</font>

1402
01:07:04,739 --> 01:07:08,549
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things that have worked for</font>

1403
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:11,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">you and in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terrorism context or</font>

1404
01:07:08,549 --> 01:07:13,288
otherwise right i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that vietnamese</font>

1405
01:07:11,400 --> 01:07:14,609
still at an early stage and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we now</font>

1406
01:07:13,289 --> 01:07:17,569
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't need to talk about</font>

1407
01:07:14,609 --> 01:07:20,940
terrorism before it can silence dissent

1408
01:07:17,569 --> 01:07:22,558
if you are found guilty of conducting

1409
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:24,269
propaganda against the state and you

1410
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,630
thrown in jail so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need</font>

1411
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:30,058
terrorism per se however despite<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the</font>

1412
01:07:27,630 --> 01:07:32,579
difficulties<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think that there are</font>

1413
01:07:30,059 --> 01:07:34,469
still enormous opportunities because of

1414
01:07:32,579 --> 01:07:37,499
the rise of the Internet the rise of

1415
01:07:34,469 --> 01:07:40,619
social<font color="#E5E5E5"> media and especially also because</font>

1416
01:07:37,499 --> 01:07:45,538
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact that never have been amazed</font>

1417

and not just online but also<font color="#E5E5E5"> offline I</font>

1423
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:02,999
dollars a return ticket now will cost

1428
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:16,500
facebook but it's blue sky viber

1429
01:08:13,410 --> 01:08:17,040
whatsapp you name it it's much easier

1430
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:19,260
for

1431
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:21,960
people to connect not just with each

1432
01:08:19,260 --> 01:08:23,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">other but also between countries for</font>

1433
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:27,630
example Vietnam because<font color="#CCCCCC"> its joint the AC</font>

1434
01:08:23,850 --> 01:08:31,040
on now Vietnamese can travel within AZN

1435
01:08:27,630 --> 01:08:34,410
without needing a visa so that is an

1436
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:36,930
enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity for Vietnamese and</font>

1437
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:39,990
other nationalities to get together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1438
01:08:36,930 --> 01:08:42,660
and overcome all the problems that they

1439
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:46,979
face with the government so yes it's

1440
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:54,318
difficult but there's also some really

1441

great life at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tunnel nice</font>

1442
01:08:54,319 --> 01:09:01,080
hi yes whatever we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do have some</font>

1443
01:08:58,890 --> 01:09:04,350
really broad anti-terrorism laws but

1444
01:09:01,080 --> 01:09:06,029
usually what is being used in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1445
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:08,700
introduce surveillance or in order to

1446
01:09:06,029 --> 01:09:11,009
reduce in order to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> us look some</font>

1447
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:15,269
digital rights is the argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1448
01:09:11,010 --> 01:09:17,460
security as a general so I we always

their best techniques and if you know or

01:10:57,060 --> 01:11:04,460
if you are involved in q2 or good data

1489
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:10,830
that would help us to mitigate or to

<font color="#CCCCCC">work get deployed epi and then all right</font>
