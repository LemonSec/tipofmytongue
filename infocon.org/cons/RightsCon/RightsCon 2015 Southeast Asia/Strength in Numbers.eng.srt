00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:02,130
in 2013 we have a landmark event where

37

the lawmaker transmog as the hong kong

38
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:06,449
government to release the number for

and also<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had come providers and</font>

44
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:21,880
then the Hong Kong government is quite

45
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:26,609
cooperative if it is that I'd help but

46
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,859
in the PDF format and this is the

so its ability to<font color="#E5E5E5"> color for the normal</font>

for the online users ordinary citizens

00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:41,079
to interpret the data that so what to

51
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:44,950
one of our objectives is to interpret

52
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:50,020
analyze and try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out the missing</font>

53
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:53,380
data then we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a worry in over a</font>

54
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:56,170
lacquer important event last year I

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:59,370
believe many of you a notice which which

56
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:02,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the Occupy central movement and and</font>

57
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:06,780
then the during the movement which

58
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:09,250
lasted around three<font color="#E5E5E5"> months a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of fun</font>

59
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,140
there were a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of four speculations</font>

60
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,230
over whether the Hong Kong government is

61
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:19,269
a monitoring so the ruling the activists

62
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:22,600
the for Team Aqua sea for democracy

63
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:25,270
leaders and the one way to<font color="#CCCCCC"> examine it is</font>

64
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:30,780
to issued how the Hong Kong government

65
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:33,790
access accesses the user data online so

66
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:35,440
following Jesus speculations the public

67
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:37,630
is very curious know<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the</font>

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,280
government is the more notorious and the

00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:42,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">white bottom of the lists can be</font>

70
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:46,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">justified and who can the user comes on</font>

71
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:50,950
to protect<font color="#CCCCCC"> their privacy then I'd like</font>

72
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:52,989
to introduce a<font color="#CCCCCC"> wiring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> transparency</font>

73
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:55,480
reporting I believe many of you are

74
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:59,110
experts here so i<font color="#E5E5E5"> will just mention this</font>

75
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,780
very very quickly first to respect

76
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:05,950
internet users<font color="#CCCCCC"> directional such as how</font>

77

the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> is accessing my own and</font>

78
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,769
I've have such as my IP address email

79
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:14,050
email and the phone locks and it is also

80
00:04:11,770 --> 00:04:16,299
good<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the comments and the companies</font>

81
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:19,209
to build a calm ability and finally it

82
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:21,130
is for a best practice followed by the

83
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:24,220
well-known<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet companies like</font>

these funny two companies have engaged

handily rely on that that have released

a better government on other hand we

98
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:06,289
also use the Hong Kong's Freedom of

is no law this is a call soon it's not a

104
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:23,030
legally binding so the comments

very clearly this is the in those three

years<font color="#CCCCCC"> total commitment to user data</font>

113
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:52,780
wonder like what a law a law enforcement

00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:55,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">agencies many such requests so we also</font>

this is the content removal<font color="#CCCCCC"> request such</font>

as to remove the web<font color="#CCCCCC"> pages are happy</font>

118
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:07,849
requests are divided by different

119
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:10,310
government departments as you can see

120
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:15,740
clearly the biggest number for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the card</font>

121
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:18,710
was issued<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the police and the reasons</font>

122
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:21,080
for the user data requests the pump the

123
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:25,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">biggest</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> reason is crime prevention and</font>

124
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,969
detection but to the as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will mention I</font>

125
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:32,960
as I will mention later because there is

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:35,660
no law in Hong Kong<font color="#E5E5E5"> to regulate the law</font>

127
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,390
enforcement agencies request so we have

128
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:40,680
no way to justify whether it<font color="#CCCCCC"> gives a</font>

129
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,659
nice to incorporate and pop up

130
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,300
a person 80 for the law enforcement

131
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:47,910
agencies to request<font color="#E5E5E5"> such that data and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is the removal crest and the</font>

134
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:57,240
building up of house is for the reason

135
00:06:54,930 --> 00:07:00,330
is to compact<font color="#CCCCCC"> a copyright input</font>

136
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:04,650
infringement again the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

137
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:10,190
because knoll also know very seldom the

138
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:13,169
government can justify the the reasons

139
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so this is what these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> members did</font>

140
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:17,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">not tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us apparently the conventional</font>

141
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,300
is on the data but according<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our</font>

142
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,799
analysis is not the case<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as I</font>

143
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:25,169
mentioned no laws or regulations

144
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,720
governing the law enforcement agencies

145
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:31,349
that have or content removal<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

146
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:34,470
and then there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no independent</font>

147

00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:13,469
better government agencies for instance

159
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:17,009
our legislature has been made several

160
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:19,139
requests according to and so how many of

161
00:08:17,009 --> 00:08:22,460
the government requests were actually

162
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:27,090
fired and cod orders which is a very

163
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:29,190
important way to examine the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,689
how many hope for the police department

181
00:09:19,389 --> 00:09:28,180
the other analysis is regarding this one

00:09:25,149 --> 00:09:30,250
as you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly say the plate the</font>

using the tip dance to crack down on the

00:09:57,009 --> 00:10:04,389

194
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,399
review of the camp of the company's

196
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">because when we talk about transparency</font>

197
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:12,100
reporting there were two sides one is

198
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:14,769
the government you can stand<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the</font>

199
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:18,009
other side is one of the companies will

200
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:20,319
identify<font color="#E5E5E5"> the users privacy whether the</font>

203
00:10:22,899 --> 00:10:29,410
meet this graph and so the companies who

204
00:10:27,189 --> 00:10:31,779
do business in Hong Kong how many

205
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:33,519
requests they may be received from the

206

Hong Kong hollow enforcement agencies

207
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:38,829
how many accounts how many user accounts

208
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:41,410
were affected by the government requests

209
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:43,239
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the number of requests aware</font>

210
00:10:41,410 --> 00:10:44,889
that these<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies produced some data</font>

so we cannot help back to wonder how can

you just trust these companies in

transparency reporting at Google in 2010

349
00:18:34,890 --> 00:18:38,580
I was in response basically to two

350
00:18:37,350 --> 00:18:41,129
trends that were happening at the same

351
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,770
time one we were getting more requests

352
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:46,500
for user data that we were before so a

353
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:48,629
definite uptick in both user data and in

354
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:51,030
demands by governments to remove content

355
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,350
and there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> just more interest from</font>

356
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:54,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">the public</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about what was actually</font>

357
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:57,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">happening and how things and how both we</font>

358
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:58,440
were handling these and the number of

359
00:18:57,270 --> 00:19:01,320
requests that were coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> from their</font>

360
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,520
respective governments at the time made

361
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:04,500
a decision that let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make it</font>

362
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,510
public because we<font color="#E5E5E5"> realized that we did</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">not have very much leverage in terms of</font>

00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:10,530
pushing back in certain circumstances

365
00:19:08,270 --> 00:19:13,280
because the public<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wasn't aware</font>

366
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,960
exactly of what the processes look like

367
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,520
the scale of the requests and for what

368
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:19,980
reasons governments for making both of

369
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:23,160
these types of requests so we publish a

370
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,049
report of publicly available site it's

371

it just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple of categories we broke</font>

out requests for user data and request

for to remove content and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we broken up</font>

376

by countries so people could see

377
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:44,928
specifically which governments were

378
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,690
requesting more and over time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as we</font>

released data every six months since and

00:19:48,690 --> 00:19:52,890
the each time we try<font color="#CCCCCC"> and have some</font>

381
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:55,830
sort of innovation in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the report itself</font>

to give people<font color="#E5E5E5"> more information so we</font>

started off<font color="#CCCCCC"> with just two numbers we</font>

moved to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> legal process so whether it</font>

385
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:06,540
was a subpoena or a court order we moved

386
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:10,320
to even more granular details in the

387
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:12,540
countries there was a there was some big

388
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:14,960
gaps in the data frankly especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

now that yes the transparency report is

comprehensive in terms of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> requests</font>

401

well<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually the Vodafone transparency</font>

408
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,260
report was really revolutionary other

409
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,909
companies have done some really great

410
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:01,710
stuff and innovated that we're now

411
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,080
chasing trying to provide that<font color="#E5E5E5"> level of</font>

access Vodafone they publish their

transparency report that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> release we</font>

417
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:18,379
were very specific in how we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about</font>

outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US the goal here is that is</font>

420
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:26,879
to increase user trust from a business

421
00:21:24,210 --> 00:21:29,070
perspective the more users can see this

422
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,570
information presumably the more trust

423
00:21:29,070 --> 00:21:32,280
they'll have in our services that they

424
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:36,360
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is handling their data</font>

425
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:38,070
on that side and you know honestly<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

426
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:39,870
next step I think companies have really

427
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:42,480
pushed the boundaries of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in many</font>

many regards and have been leading with

support of<font color="#E5E5E5"> civil society of course but</font>

430
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:48,270
ultimately we want governments to be

431
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:49,950
doing this reporting themselves it's a

432
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:51,480
much more<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideal situation you can look</font>

the things citizens would have a much

463
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,510
the government to do that and this is

464
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:05,909
not even legally panting so it's quite

465
00:23:03,510 --> 00:23:08,669
difficult for<font color="#E5E5E5"> them the citizens in Hong</font>

466
00:23:05,909 --> 00:23:10,799
Kong viewer request the government to

467
00:23:08,669 --> 00:23:13,230
you to surrender their information and

468
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:15,510
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually do we try to make a lot of</font>

00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:18,240
excuses to you know to stop us from

obtaining the data from the garba may as

471
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:25,770
well and apart from that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I actually in</font>

don't even<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the privacy statement is</font>

475
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:35,908
quite surprising when we try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look for</font>

their privacy statement or terms of

how what kind of information they they

they would give to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government and</font>

482
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:52,678
even more surprisingly is that and they

00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,350
request quite a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

490
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:11,490
because of the marketing purposes but at

491
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,049
the same time when they and the

492
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,000
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to that man requesting</font>

493

that the users information we wonder

00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:16,760
what kind of information that they are

495
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:18,950
given

496
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:20,450
never done and then they usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

497
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:21,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">will you ask them Oh what kind of</font>

information<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are giving to the</font>

499
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,010
government and then they said are they

500
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:26,570
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't tell us because they are</font>

501
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,010
afraid that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government will come to</font>

502
00:24:26,570 --> 00:24:29,480
them and saying that they're they're

503
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,280
perfectly the cause of publishers

504
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,230
justice because they're usually they

505
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:34,970
govern authority would we say that i'll

506
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:37,010
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it because of detection</font>

507
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:39,470
of crime and they couldn't protect you

508
00:24:37,010 --> 00:24:42,470
know disclose information and his stage

509
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:44,450
and apart from that is Jennifer Jennifer

510
00:24:42,470 --> 00:24:46,490
I said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and some of the police would</font>

511
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:48,020
just give a call to their companies and

512
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:50,030
then they try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to you know fish for the</font>

513
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,220
information without you two following

514
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:55,160
the proper procedure as well it's

515
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:57,440
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> quite common and because the</font>

516
00:24:55,160 --> 00:25:00,410
police<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that Oh since you're</font>

517
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:02,870
only surrendering<font color="#CCCCCC"> voluntarily then is</font>

518
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,390
you know they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> already obtained your</font>

519
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:07,370
content by conduct and so it's quite

520
00:25:05,390 --> 00:25:08,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">outrageous actually because the</font>

521
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:11,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">government the government or the police</font>

522
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:13,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">should follow the procedure or at least</font>

523
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:18,290
you have iphone for work or subpoena to

524
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:22,760
you or the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and I mean in</font>

525
00:25:18,290 --> 00:25:24,800
Hong Kong a psycho quite a lot of

526
00:25:22,760 --> 00:25:26,690
companies say they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not they are not</font>

527
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,190
like Google or the Yahoo like big

528
00:25:26,690 --> 00:25:30,470
companies they always have a legal team

529
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:31,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">to support them well</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these isp they</font>

530
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:33,890
don't have the legal team<font color="#CCCCCC"> to support</font>

531
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,100
them that's why whenever they come to

532
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:38,720
you the government they try my leg of em

533
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,879
try to repress the information they were

534
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,550
just you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I always just give it to</font>

535
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:46,390
you to say save<font color="#E5E5E5"> time and save money and</font>

536
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:48,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the pub one of the</font>

00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:50,780
problems or difficulties that<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're</font>

538
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:53,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">small components that made that may face</font>

539
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:56,480
and another problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the netizens is</font>

540
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,640
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> do order general public people</font>

541
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,650
don't know what these are transparency

542
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,780
before can benefit them and they don't

543
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:04,640
know why the<font color="#CCCCCC"> company is trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

544
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:07,370
decent and how could they you say that

545
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,050
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm saying that I probably</font>

546
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,090
the next step would be the public

547
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:13,490
education that to the general public how

548
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:15,530
we can utilize this and transverse a

549
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,030
report or<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give the government some</font>

550
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:19,090
pressure that they shouldn't require

551
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:23,000
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the information so randomly</font>

552
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:27,320
thank you great thank you well I think

553
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,900
we've oh yeah I'm applause I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we've</font>

554
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,689
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotten some great</font>

555
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:34,390
some great<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas out there you know</font>

556
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,920
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> have raised the reporting by</font>

557
00:26:34,390 --> 00:26:38,410
governments and their reporting by

558
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:41,710
companies and how those might strengthen

559
00:26:38,410 --> 00:26:44,790
each other we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen the links between</font>

560
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:49,140
civil society and academia and

561
00:26:44,790 --> 00:26:51,790
government reporting and I think we've

562
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,580
seen that there is some problems around

563
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,790
business models and data protection

564
00:26:54,580 --> 00:27:00,460
standards in terms of the corporate

565
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:04,450
collection of data and government access

566
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,360
to that data if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get a show of</font>

567
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:09,700
hands from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> audience just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> idea how</font>

through some of these NGO reports great

575
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:43,980
well we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a few questions we wanted</font>

they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be use to produce more</font>

00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:57,729
government transparency so first I wanna

581
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:23,080
do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put it out to you d have any</font>

582
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:25,300
questions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> response to the you're</font>

583
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:33,730
saying if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government is making a</font>

584
00:28:25,300 --> 00:28:35,050
request of Google how do they so I'm

585
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:36,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure companies are different on how to</font>

586
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:39,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">handle these types of requests we have a</font>

587
00:28:36,910 --> 00:28:41,560
web form it's available so we the

588
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:42,040
requests and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then ePrint we the request</font>

589
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,929
could come

590
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,000
many forms some of them mail them they

591
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,440
may come to a local office ultimately

592
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,450
they get funneled to a central team

593
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:51,610
based in California who has the legal

594
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:53,560
expertise who is separate from the

595
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:54,820
political pressures that are individual

596
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:57,399
team to make based in different places

597
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,669
and they can specifically assess those

598
00:28:57,400 --> 00:29:02,560
types of those requests for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most</font>

599
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,690
part content of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual content</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

600
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:07,060
communications that needs to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> through</font>

601
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:07,990
a mutual legal assistance process that

602
00:29:07,060 --> 00:29:10,929
goes through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the United States</font>

603
00:29:07,990 --> 00:29:13,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">government so it's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit slightly</font>

604
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:15,670
slightly different but yeah again the

605
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:17,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">requesting come in by a male we try and</font>

606
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:20,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">point people towards the web form that's</font>

607
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:51,640
the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to do it but they all get</font>

608
00:29:20,650 --> 00:29:57,030
sent to California but can want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> die</font>

609
00:29:51,640 --> 00:30:02,490
let and in commerce room or sis TV and

610
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:08,470
but there are issues there issues of the

611
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:16,720
privacy like sexual private merciless a

612
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:20,500
chiral movie is the is this close is not

613
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:31,510
disclosed to the public sorry I must not

614
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> English sir yeah anyone I know really</font>

615
00:30:31,510 --> 00:30:37,660
so Google started to try to transparency

616
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:41,560
boy many companies<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments following</font>

617
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:42,980
and what extent<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it is that repeats</font>

618
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,740
have standardization

619
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:49,010
the server core team is that a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

620
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,440
at least resolving 14 months and are

621
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:53,140
there any n % a way to have similar

622
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,299
protocols so that you can actually

623
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:58,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice to each other I'm okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

624
00:30:56,299 --> 00:31:01,400
extent to<font color="#E5E5E5"> which has given a problem so</font>

625
00:30:58,220 --> 00:31:02,840
I'd love to get new and thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

626
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:06,799
memorable I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think this year all</font>

627
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:08,418
involved I'll kick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it off and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

628
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:11,210
others can answer so I've definitely

629
00:31:08,419 --> 00:31:12,679
heard that<font color="#E5E5E5"> concern many times from civil</font>

630
00:31:11,210 --> 00:31:14,390
society groups others who want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

631
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:17,419
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make meaningful comparisons of</font>

632
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:19,280
what what this data looks like and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

633
00:31:17,419 --> 00:31:21,020
mean frankly to as far as I know there

634
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:22,610
hasn't been a ton of collaboration

635
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:25,100
between companies and a lot of this

636
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,750
stuff they're probably could be a lot

637
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">more to make things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit more</font>

638
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:31,220
standardized our approach is to be

639
00:31:29,059 --> 00:31:34,490
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be as clear as possible in</font>

640
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:36,020
terms<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the definitions of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the data</font>

641
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:38,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we're using we're talking about</font>

642
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,700
users / accounts we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> define that</font>

643
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:42,350
so people<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the other issue is</font>

644
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:45,320
frankly is that our services are all

645
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:46,939
super<font color="#E5E5E5"> different so what Google does is</font>

646
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,220
very different than service that

647
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:51,080
Facebook provides or even comparisons

648
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:53,270
between Google and Yahoo we operate very

649
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:54,620
differently so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it something</font>

650
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:56,960
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> just download one spreadsheet</font>

651
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:00,559
have meaningful data to comparatives is

652
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,880
really tough the area where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you can make</font>

653
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">it a lot more standardizes with</font>

654
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,179
governments they can tell you

655
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:08,120
specifically how many requests they're

656
00:32:05,179 --> 00:32:09,890
making to ICT companies what type of

657
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:11,989
data they're demanding whether it's

658
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,610
personal communication content or those

659
00:32:11,990 --> 00:32:15,290
types of things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there is the</font>

660
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:23,330
opportunity for more standardization<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

661
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:24,980
a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> this yeah I actually thinking</font>

662
00:32:23,330 --> 00:32:28,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the transfers repost should break</font>

663
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:30,710
down into<font color="#E5E5E5"> different authorities from the</font>

664
00:32:28,370 --> 00:32:32,899
government because that when<font color="#CCCCCC"> y you can</font>

665
00:32:30,710 --> 00:32:34,580
see from the Treasury transfer to report

666
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:36,470
that if it's from college probably it

667
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">will be criminal but it is from the</font>

668
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,890
custom<font color="#CCCCCC"> then hopefully</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will be copyright</font>

669
00:32:38,059 --> 00:32:43,450
infringement<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean at least a normal</font>

670
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:46,850
situation and then it is from there some

671
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:48,260
like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> stock market authority then it</font>

672
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,540
would be something about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the commercial</font>

673
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:52,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">prime and at least we from a reader</font>

674
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,590
point of view then I can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> out what</font>

675
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:56,860
what kind of information that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font>

676
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,199
their<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies surrendering</font>

677
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,780
and then what which are cut down our

678
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:10,929
bodies they are trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

679
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:12,820
requesting the information inside yeah

680
00:33:10,929 --> 00:33:14,710
you know I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> a stabilization and</font>

681
00:33:12,820 --> 00:33:17,080
looking for a common baseline is

682
00:33:14,710 --> 00:33:20,080
something back to<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is certainly in</font>

683
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:21,820
favor of I'm not sure whether that can

684
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,600
happen across different countries since

685
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:27,820
legal regimes vary so much and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

686
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,500
we're working with partners to try and

687
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:31,780
understand how that can happen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

688
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:34,120
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think as the numbers dude</font>

689
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:36,490
get simply a baseline at had one company

690
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:41,830
and they will get more valuable over

691
00:33:36,490 --> 00:34:18,639
time to show trends and different

692
00:33:41,830 --> 00:34:19,989
political change<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah and so I just</font>

693
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,330
introduced to what do you think that

694
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:32,500
yoga pants<font color="#E5E5E5"> would provide such</font>

695
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:34,299
information right so yeah the questions

696
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:36,668
about whether governments can be trusted

697
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:39,100
to report accurate data and I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

698
00:34:36,668 --> 00:34:41,259
add there is a divide sometimes

699
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:45,790
especially the<font color="#E5E5E5"> u.s. between the national</font>

700
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:49,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">security requests or even takedowns and</font>

701
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:51,820
I face and requests on from traditional

702
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:58,060
law enforcement or crime fighting or

703
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:59,830
copyright enforcement authorities I I

704
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:02,730
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say that I can trust my</font>

705
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:04,869
government because it's not the

706
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:07,300
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are united through a</font>

707
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:09,550
democracy in Hong Kong but I had a same

708
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:11,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> where I I mean when where</font>

709
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:15,400
look at the legal framework in Hong Kong

710
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:18,129
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we don't have a information log</font>

711
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:19,720
or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the open data act like other</font>

712
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:21,730
countries in Southeast Asia and the

713
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,980
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we only have to</font>

714
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,410
cooperate it's so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there is</font>

715
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:30,760
absolutely there some dead there's links

716
00:35:26,410 --> 00:35:33,730
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a you know a low oil and x2000</font>

717
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:35,680
is kind of government behavior so that

718
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:38,290
we can tell that the government is

719
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:40,779
correct in providing the data so i would

720
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:49,060
say the in<font color="#E5E5E5"> hong kong nowadays only a co</font>

721
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:51,100
op SEC is not enough great so definitely

722
00:35:49,060 --> 00:35:54,700
some skepticism but some some hope to

723
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:56,860
for a legislative<font color="#CCCCCC"> mate you know since</font>

724
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,169
especially is about<font color="#CCCCCC"> government we'd love</font>

725
00:35:56,860 --> 00:36:10,090
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get any government representatives in</font>

726
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:13,660
the room mr. mark<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we just yes</font>

727
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:17,500
I'm Charlton mark I'm legislature in

728

Hong Kong and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I certainly don't</font>

729
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:23,740
represent a cup of mint actually I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

730
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:25,330
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> opposition but but I of course I</font>

731
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,879
have actually happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be the person</font>

732
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:29,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Hong Kong who actually requested the</font>

733
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:31,630
government to give these numbers

734
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:33,880
starting three years ago and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the</font>

735
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">last three years they've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been giving us</font>

736
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,160
some numbers that Craig doesn't seem to

737
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:40,450
trust very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't actually I</font>

738
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't think the number is the big issue</font>

739
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:45,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">because whether or not the numbers are</font>

740
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:47,410
real first of all it does give us a

741
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,440
little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a trend you know</font>

742
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,480
year-on-year you know whether the<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font>

743
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:55,330
of access or the number of removal

744
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:57,100
request has been increasing or

745
00:36:55,330 --> 00:37:01,870
decreasing of course is being increasing

746
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:04,569
and but i think is more important that

747
00:37:01,870 --> 00:37:07,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">we try as much as we can to hold the</font>

748
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:11,590
government responsible by having either

749
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:14,799
civil society or your legislators your

750
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:17,080
your congressmen and so on to try to ask

751
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,390
those questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> from your government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

752
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:21,279
try to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that those answers because</font>

753
00:37:19,390 --> 00:37:23,060
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> strange that you know we've been</font>

754
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:25,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell the company</font>

755
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:27,620
to be transparent whereas our government

756
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:30,259
actually I start very<font color="#E5E5E5"> transparent of</font>

757
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:32,330
course<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a little bit to my surprise</font>

758
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:34,010
that you know three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago two and a</font>

759
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:35,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">half years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago when i passed the</font>

760
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:38,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">government in hong kong to provide us</font>

761
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:40,460
information actually did provide it as

762
00:37:38,450 --> 00:37:42,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us with you know at least</font>

763
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">numbers but of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course they didn't tell</font>

764
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:47,150
us the details of those cases which is

765
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:48,950
the real problem which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what create</font>

766
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:50,990
mentioned you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i wouldn't go into</font>

767
00:37:48,950 --> 00:37:53,000
the details but they asked a<font color="#E5E5E5"> number of</font>

768
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:54,950
these cases that we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

769
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more details on and the government</font>

770
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:59,540
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long long time just wouldn't give</font>

771
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,220
us any any any any answer so what's

772
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:04,100
what's in a number they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> give us the</font>

773
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,620
number of fine but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i totally agree</font>

774
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">with correct that we need a law that</font>

775
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,259
would enforce government's who are

776
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,400
archived and then to release those

777
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:16,880
government related data and information

778
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:20,300
to us but but finally yeah I do really

779
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,070
agreed I really think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font>

780
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,960
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> still hold governments</font>

781
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:25,880
responsible is in the same ways that

782
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,620
probably in other sessions today and

783
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:29,960
tomorrow we<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be talking about</font>

784
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:32,180
holding two companies responsible as

785
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:34,480
well and then once you know it was

786
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:36,560
complete give us certain data about

787
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:39,140
governments in a wide wooden government

788
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,620
give us those data as well in one last

789
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:44,180
point actually in Hong Kong<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the group</font>

790
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,319
to a little bit of credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

791
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:50,390
government they actually give us

792
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:54,680
detailed of details of these numbers by

793
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:57,319
department so so i would say while i

794
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:59,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't quite believe the numbers of some</font>

795
00:38:57,320 --> 00:39:02,240
of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> department's like police or and</font>

796
00:38:59,810 --> 00:39:04,250
so on but there are you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know you could</font>

797
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,009
actually find other trends in other

798
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:10,220
departments that you never would think

799
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:13,580
of as you know ask a phone or your ISPs

800
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:15,319
to remove or a content and so on and

801
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:17,690
then they turned out to be the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that</font>

802
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:20,480
they are actually quite quite frequently

803
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:22,280
remove asking I speeds to remove content

804
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,770
so those kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information I think out</font>

805
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:26,750
useful too I mean but<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> course you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

806
00:39:24,770 --> 00:39:29,570
Jennifer can tell you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all the</font>

807
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:32,330
difficulties of you know how we can we

808
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:34,400
you know researchers like that like them

809
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:35,460
in Hong Kong you have been trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

810
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,190
further detail

811
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:41,760
deeper<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the numbers and and then</font>

812
00:39:38,190 --> 00:39:46,290
we'll be getting into a stone wall yes

813
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:49,560
all i can say thank you well picking up

814
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:53,700
on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point of how we can put</font>

815
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,620
governments under the pressure to

816
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:58,799
release more data and more useful and

817
00:39:55,620 --> 00:40:00,500
meaningful data and qualitative data<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

818
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:03,690
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have one asked you on</font>

819
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:07,440
since there was a public outcry in Korea

820
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:08,910
there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of demand from users to</font>

821
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,420
understand how the government was

822
00:40:08,910 --> 00:40:15,960
accessing their data and companies very

823
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:19,890
much came out in favor of greater

824
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:22,080
transparency but also greater ability to

825
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:25,830
push back against those government

826
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:27,270
requests<font color="#E5E5E5"> how have you as a civil society</font>

827
00:40:25,830 --> 00:40:29,100
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could have my research have you</font>

828
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:31,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">worked with the companies have you</font>

829
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:37,140
developed any sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of common strategy to</font>

830
00:40:31,940 --> 00:40:40,970
to increase from Maine transparency I've

831
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:47,850
never worked with the taxi<font color="#CCCCCC"> company and</font>

832
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:51,180
just we are our<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose is that involve</font>

833
00:40:47,850 --> 00:41:01,380
the government censorship and

834
00:40:51,180 --> 00:41:05,730
surveillance appropriate so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think how</font>

835
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:10,410
we can make the government transparent

836
00:41:05,730 --> 00:41:12,930
and I think it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> legislation that can</font>

837
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:17,870
make government discloses that's data

838
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:22,140
although cases fees will ever relatively

839
00:41:17,870 --> 00:41:25,259
cooperated to we live video with me and

840
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,440
data regarding surveillance it would not

841
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:31,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">be easy to receive because it's a</font>

842
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,920
community related to the crime

843
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:37,590
investigation so it seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hard</font>

844
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:41,300
that leading<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government's voluntary</font>

845
00:41:37,590 --> 00:41:44,400
disclosing I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to lead</font>

846
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:46,200
legislation or lawsuit or cooperating

847
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,970
with Member of Parliament who can

848
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,040
pressure the government in the

849
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:57,049
parliamentary

850
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:59,960
spection it's is the drug thing any

851
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:02,750
other ideas on how civil society and

852
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:07,780
made appropriations and academics can

853
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,780
work together to increase transparency

854
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:16,910
that's a really good idea so you cut

855
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:21,169
you've got questions that we need to

856
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:23,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">constantly at least partially one with</font>

857
00:42:21,170 --> 00:42:25,490
really good ways to actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> for civil</font>

society only<font color="#CCCCCC"> what you need to us</font>

859
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:31,520
actually get it through there and peace

860
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:33,230
to a state parliament where usually they

861
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:35,420
come and test it out here at least

862
00:42:33,230 --> 00:42:37,550
develop other<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news so I think one</font>

863
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:40,460
way to work here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what do we need</font>

864
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:42,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">to not and then once that's because they</font>

00:42:51,730 --> 00:42:57,109
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one place to start is the</font>

869
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:59,569
areas where the requests are most

870
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,710
centralized so for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example at national</font>

871
00:42:59,569 --> 00:43:04,220
security letters in the united states

872
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:05,540
are pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much run by the FBI and when</font>

873
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,299
you can make it you can identify

874
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:11,450
specific agencies or others<font color="#CCCCCC"> who are who</font>

875
00:43:08,299 --> 00:43:13,460
are making requests that is a great

876
00:43:11,450 --> 00:43:15,200
interest to the public you can start in

877
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:17,390
those specific areas that make it easier

878
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:19,220
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> we want to find out every single you</font>

879
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:21,200
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what all the police across a large</font>

880
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:23,029
country are asking that's an incredible

881
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:25,040
lip it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot so I think</font>

882
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:27,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">the more specific we can get identify</font>

883
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,839
what is in the public interest its most

884
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,419
helpful and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then if we can make our</font>

885
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,308
first asked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to a specific government</font>

886
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:35,839
agency where its most centralized where

887
00:43:34,309 --> 00:43:37,640
those requests come from I think that's

888
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:40,250
kind of where we get our first wins on

889
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:41,808
this and then is the public recognizes

890
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,380
the value of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that type of transparency</font>

891
00:43:41,809 --> 00:43:46,880
it's easier to<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask for some of those</font>

892
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:48,500
transparency requests where it's there's

893
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,790
much more government bureaucracy it

894
00:43:48,500 --> 00:43:52,160
needs to get together to actually make

895
00:43:49,790 --> 00:43:54,500
that happen right so don't see

896
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,680
government says one monolithic ordinance

897
00:43:54,500 --> 00:44:03,950
entity but rather a number of different

898
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:06,640
departments of different levels so yet

899
00:44:03,950 --> 00:44:10,839
another question for Jennifer as<font color="#E5E5E5"> one a</font>

900
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:14,720
what reforms uce that would increase

901
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:17,630
public trust and perhaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> a oversight of</font>

902
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:19,220
the government surveillance but all sort

903
00:44:17,630 --> 00:44:21,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of just the data that's being released</font>

904
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:24,470
is there anything in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

905
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:26,900
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> help you to trust that data you</font>

906
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:28,910
pointed out a few different<font color="#E5E5E5"> gaps and and</font>

907
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:33,530
what's being released but is there any

908
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:35,270
particular data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would help well I</font>

909
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:39,170
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the line of them are</font>

910
00:44:35,270 --> 00:44:42,020
problems I just pointed out is the lack

911
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:44,450
of four independent oversight because

912
00:44:42,020 --> 00:44:47,780
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> police the law enforcement agency</font>

913
00:44:44,450 --> 00:44:51,410
the four I think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the part in the</font>

914
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:54,319
past four years they never give us an

915
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:57,740
exact number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how many requests were</font>

916
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:01,520
done and the court orders so we have no

917
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:03,049
way to know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of mechanisms are</font>

918
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">examining of</font>

919
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:07,310
you telling them the government's

920
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:09,319
request so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it would be really</font>

921
00:45:07,310 --> 00:45:12,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">great if the government can disclose</font>

922
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:18,800
commonly how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> award under</font>

923
00:45:12,440 --> 00:45:23,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">call orders also another thing is as</font>

924
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:26,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">quake just mentioned this transparency</font>

925
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:30,260
report is a relatively new<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Hong Kong</font>

926
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:34,190
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ordinary internet and users</font>

927
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:36,890
so if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> alumina users can realize how</font>

928
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,810
important it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have the right to</font>

929
00:45:36,890 --> 00:45:41,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what what is happening to their</font>

930
00:45:38,810 --> 00:45:45,470
online that huh then they will my thing

931
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:47,540
might be can start like pressuring the

932
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:52,450
government pressure<font color="#CCCCCC"> India yes service</font>

933
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:55,520
providers so it is transparency<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

934
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:57,350
great um you know later has been you

935
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,950
know you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that google began</font>

936
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:05,000
reporting this data in part to enhance

937
00:46:00,950 --> 00:46:06,799
that the trust of users in<font color="#E5E5E5"> your ability</font>

938
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:10,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep their private information safe</font>

939
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:14,210
and to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protect</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it so do you have any</font>

940
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:17,240
metrics to to to understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> how that</font>

941
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:19,310
goal<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been achieved and in your mind</font>

942
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:23,180
you know what types of feedback you get

943
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:24,470
and has it been successful today yeah

944
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:26,270
it's tough to measure i mean the the

945
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:27,620
fact that the requests the number of

946
00:46:26,270 --> 00:46:29,300
requests has gone up so dramatically

947
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:31,040
that's you know we were thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

948
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:32,810
maybe at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of us were thinking</font>

949
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,310
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we showed this stuff and maybe</font>

950
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:35,840
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> will be discouraged from</font>

951
00:46:34,310 --> 00:46:38,570
submitting as the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Northwest that's</font>

952
00:46:35,840 --> 00:46:40,460
turned out to be very false you know I

953
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:42,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">think one good case study is there was a</font>

954
00:46:40,460 --> 00:46:44,840
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we were working with who</font>

955
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:47,630
saw our data and insisted that it was

956
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,130
incorrect I was like it was a minister

957
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:50,720
level official is that it's through me

958
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:52,310
that all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these requests come that's not</font>

959
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,379
happened you know we have not<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

960
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,600
making this request and unbeknownst to

961
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:58,190
him there was a different agency that

962
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:01,790
was making requests of companies for

963
00:46:58,190 --> 00:47:04,310
user data that he didn't know about so

964
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:06,110
it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific instance where the</font>

965
00:47:04,310 --> 00:47:07,490
company transparency reports are helping

966
00:47:06,110 --> 00:47:09,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">governments keep their own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> houses in</font>

967
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:10,790
order because there are less<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

968
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:12,980
happened that they didn't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

969
00:47:10,790 --> 00:47:14,660
about so I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only imagine what would</font>

970
00:47:12,980 --> 00:47:15,260
happen if they actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> started getting</font>

971
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:16,549
together

972
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:19,040
actually having conversations about

973
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:20,810
these types of requests in<font color="#E5E5E5"> their their</font>

974
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:22,430
procedures<font color="#CCCCCC"> petunia I think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

975
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:24,680
most stark example of a specific win

976
00:47:22,430 --> 00:47:28,910
that we've gotten in terms of government

977
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:31,850
processor on transparency and you know

978
00:47:28,910 --> 00:47:34,549
what kind of a feedback would users like

979
00:47:31,850 --> 00:47:36,740
to give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how a couple of reports</font>

980
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:40,820
been useful to you in your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own advocacy</font>

981
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:43,520
and how could companies or<font color="#E5E5E5"> governments I</font>

982
00:47:40,820 --> 00:47:45,620
guess make them more useful I think

983
00:47:43,520 --> 00:48:39,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the key here is to make them</font>

984
00:47:45,620 --> 00:48:41,810
effective now I'm just really i will

985
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:44,810
hopefully we get a critical mass of

986
00:48:41,810 --> 00:48:48,320
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> sent complex released a</font>

987
00:48:44,810 --> 00:48:50,049
transparent sphere and what<font color="#CCCCCC"> ben said it</font>

988
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:52,760
helped the government check their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font>

989
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,040
departments maybe if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a critical</font>

990
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:56,960
mass of transparency reports we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have</font>

991
00:48:55,040 --> 00:49:02,080
these people check each other like there

992
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:05,600
could be a centralized<font color="#CCCCCC"> check some</font>

993
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:08,090
website make sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay right um the</font>

994
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:11,690
reports coming from this country are

995
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:14,660
distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to these companies and East</font>

996
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:16,520
operate reports both of the records

997
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:18,890
records from that<font color="#CCCCCC"> country they should</font>

998
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,990
equal to each other so we<font color="#CCCCCC"> can get</font>

999
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:22,990
critical mass of companies and

1000
00:49:25,270 --> 00:49:30,200
great so a system of checks and balances

1001
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:33,470
you know it reminds me<font color="#E5E5E5"> the extractive</font>

1002
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:35,120
sector as a transparency index of works

1003
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,600
very much<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that way it's called</font>

1004
00:49:35,120 --> 00:49:40,910
publish what you pay it's about

1005
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:42,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">governments reporting all the payments</font>

1006
00:49:40,910 --> 00:49:44,149
they receive from companies and

1007
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:46,669
companies reporting all the payments

1008
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:50,060
that they make to governments and an

1009
00:49:46,670 --> 00:49:56,690
ideal world does with matchup any

1010
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:58,460
response to<font color="#E5E5E5"> occur I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's very</font>

1011
00:49:56,690 --> 00:50:01,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting when we took our Portuguese</font>

1012
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:02,840
very easy to think I that notice just

1013

how they process your data and that's

1036
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:10,850

something similar for international

that how we used to defeat to try

so small and medium-sized enterprises

1070
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:33,210
about you know companies have different

different as much differently<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's</font>

going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

1074
00:53:45,810 --> 00:53:56,170
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder if like so governments</font>

1075
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:59,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">usually ask for these requests to</font>

1076
00:53:56,170 --> 00:54:03,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">corporate what is there a follow along</font>

1077
00:53:59,770 --> 00:54:06,250
like what is the result<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:09,190
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what is this we want to</font>

1079
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">know are we actually catching criminals</font>

1080
00:54:09,190 --> 00:54:18,280
or we actually preventing certain a

<font color="#E5E5E5">package as a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> result of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> information I</font>

1082
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:25,270
diliberto all these requests with their

1083
00:54:21,930 --> 00:54:28,359
proper procedure and I think it should

1084
00:54:25,270 --> 00:54:33,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">be part of the procedure that after</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

1085
00:54:28,359 --> 00:54:36,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">is cooked privacy is so there is also a</font>

1086
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:39,220
reporting that is connected to that

1087
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:40,720
regulation so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a measure and wee</font>

1088
00:54:39,220 --> 00:54:42,790
bit late because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we don't know who</font>

1089
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,828
picked all we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that weighs these</font>

1090
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:47,770
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests for me but we don't know</font>

1091
00:54:44,829 --> 00:54:51,430
like how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> criminals we caught or not</font>

1092
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">me crimes result possibly like maybe 200</font>

1093
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:58,690
million requested couples manic or maybe

1094
00:54:55,180 --> 00:55:02,049
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> get 15 requests and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> o'clock 50</font>

1095
00:54:58,690 --> 00:55:06,480
sexual predators<font color="#E5E5E5"> so he was your third so</font>

1096
00:55:02,050 --> 00:55:06,480
like I'm thinking how do we measure

1097
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:15,399
raises a lot of questions yet does

1098
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,560
anyone want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to respond immediately this</font>

1099
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:18,940
is basically so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can imagine law</font>

1100
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:22,930
enforcement would be just kind of

1101
00:55:18,940 --> 00:55:24,520
bristling at that idea the idea of

1102
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:26,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">having to be accountable</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the type of</font>

1103
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,550
information because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> would then if</font>

1104
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:28,900
they could need it later or they<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1105
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:30,910
it could help it later there's some sort

1106
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:33,819
of turned from them asking for that I'm

1107
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:35,290
sure but that's that's kind of a creepy

1108
00:55:33,819 --> 00:55:36,609
idea but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the u.s.</font>

1109
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:37,779
specifically there are two great

1110
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,970
examples of this that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are coming out</font>

1111
00:55:37,780 --> 00:55:41,980
right now one is with the Foreign

1112
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:44,049
Intelligence Surveillance Act we have

1113
00:55:41,980 --> 00:55:45,609
some members in the intelligence

1114
00:55:44,050 --> 00:55:47,680
community saying this information is

1115
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:50,380
essential you have members of Congress

1116
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:51,970
who are saying there's no credible cases

1117
00:55:50,380 --> 00:55:53,319
where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can demonstrate that those</font>

1118
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:55,450
types of demands are those orders

1119
00:55:53,319 --> 00:55:56,619
actually influence investigations I

1120
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:58,140
think those types of questions are

1121
00:55:56,619 --> 00:55:59,579
exactly the right ones

1122
00:55:58,140 --> 00:56:02,730
next area where this is going to be very

1123
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:04,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">prevalent soon is encryption and the</font>

1124
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:07,109
ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which companies encrypt their</font>

1125
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:08,630
data whether or not that encryption is

1126
00:56:07,109 --> 00:56:11,700
inhibiting law enforcement

1127
00:56:08,630 --> 00:56:15,089
investigations and I think having a very

1128
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:16,799
tangible<font color="#CCCCCC"> number space but also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1129
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:18,150
narrative based approaches to win it is

1130
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:19,529
helpful and it's not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help</font>

1131
00:56:18,150 --> 00:56:37,829
inform<font color="#E5E5E5"> us as to how we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should address</font>

1132
00:56:19,529 --> 00:56:39,990
those challenges and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google is reporting</font>

1133
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:42,510
a little bit about encryption of your

1134
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:45,509
networks and a transparency report and

1135
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:48,390
do plan to do more of that I think right

1136
00:56:45,510 --> 00:56:50,519
now it mainly refers to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two one product</font>

1137
00:56:48,390 --> 00:56:54,029
yeah well we do to say for email and

1138
00:56:50,519 --> 00:56:55,769
that yeah yeah essentially figuring out

1139
00:56:54,029 --> 00:56:57,359
how much of<font color="#E5E5E5"> our outgoing email our</font>

1140
00:56:55,769 --> 00:56:58,828
outgoing encrypted email and is being

1141
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,170
received by on the other side by

1142
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:04,079
encrypted encryption the way because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1143
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:05,279
goes both ways switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ben is this is in</font>

1144
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,950
the past for just highlighting that

1145
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:09,359
discrepancy can encourage other

1146
00:57:06,950 --> 00:57:12,000
providers of that type of service to

1147
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:13,348
pump up their standards as well such as

1148
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:16,230
one way but I mean yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we're always</font>

1149
00:57:13,349 --> 00:57:19,109
open for new ideas of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to improve</font>

1150
00:57:16,230 --> 00:57:23,700
the transparency reporter yeah new

1151
00:57:19,109 --> 00:57:25,380
information there any other companies in

1152
00:57:23,700 --> 00:57:46,730
the room want to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about their</font>

1153
00:57:25,380 --> 00:57:49,559

1154
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:53,750
special say their safety on things that

1155
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">go into investigation</font>

1156
00:58:31,430 --> 00:58:45,980
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> released</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> giving up mountains of</font>

1157
00:58:38,630 --> 00:58:49,109
evidence where a number of cases

1158
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:51,260
perseverance SP done and then the

1159
00:58:49,109 --> 00:58:57,529
percentage of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the pieces that absolutely</font>

1160
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:57,530
arrest for that is

1161
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:06,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">I also like to talk about the air with</font>

1162
00:59:04,270 --> 00:59:09,040
the power<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different authorities under</font>

1163
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,569
the law as well because at least in

1164
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:12,190
aankhon situations that are different

1165
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:15,190
authorities they have different power

1166
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:17,290
when they where they can go to request

1167
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:19,570
an information from the company so so

1168
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:21,580
basically for example like the police

1169
00:59:19,570 --> 00:59:22,890
they have you get a warrant but at the

1170
00:59:21,580 --> 00:59:25,600
same time<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the Privacy Commissioner</font>

1171
00:59:22,890 --> 00:59:27,810
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> can go</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the company and make a</font>

1172
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:30,130
wreath repress and then the date the

1173
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:32,470
reasons that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> dare during the detection</font>

1174
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:36,220
of law but what is the national crime

1175
00:59:32,470 --> 00:59:38,709
but do<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a specific offense in</font>

1176
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:40,540
mind does it<font color="#CCCCCC"> require that they have to</font>

1177
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:42,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">have this specific organism it doesn't</font>

1178
00:59:40,540 --> 00:59:44,440
really say so so whenever they come to

1179
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:46,000
you when when whenever they<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to the</font>

1180
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,800
company did<font color="#CCCCCC"> you send our way through the</font>

1181
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:50,020
detection of crime that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very</font>

1182
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:52,840
general term but I'm all about it the

1183
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:55,360
police power under there under the law

1184
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:58,450
it because they have to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a problem</font>

1185
00:59:55,360 --> 01:00:00,820
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have a specific events so I in</font>

1186
00:59:58,450 --> 01:00:02,410
different situation when they come when

1187
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:04,240
their government authorities come into

1188
01:00:02,410 --> 01:00:07,029
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> company public they're only doing it</font>

1189
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:09,459
inquiries of of the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1190
01:00:07,030 --> 01:00:12,010
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're detection of crime or</font>

1191
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:13,510
whether they<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have a specific or fancy</font>

1192
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:16,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">deadline</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that may be different night</font>

1193
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">over of a request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so maybe it would be</font>

1194
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:21,940
good that we in their transparency with

1195
01:00:19,210 --> 01:00:23,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">but that we can show that as well yes so</font>

1196
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:25,390
companies have often use your

1197
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:28,450
transparency reports to say that they

1198
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:31,299
will only respond to requests that are

1199
01:00:28,450 --> 01:00:35,589
given to them for a proper legal reason

1200
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:38,500
for proper legal process written etc so

1201
01:00:35,590 --> 01:00:43,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I can be a good way to to force more</font>

1202
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:43,260
accountability as well as transparency

1203
01:01:09,940 --> 01:01:16,490
this is actually an obstacle we have in

1204
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,590
Hong Kong actually we reason we are

1205
01:01:16,490 --> 01:01:22,479
conducting a what happens to your dad

1206
01:01:18,590 --> 01:01:26,540
have a survey and according<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a few our</font>

1207
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:30,880
forums we've been talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to they do not</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> first one to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eat the crab</font>

1209
01:01:31,060 --> 01:01:35,690
strengthen numbers is the name of the

1210
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:38,570
panel yeah and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that might be the</font>

1211
01:01:35,690 --> 01:01:41,690
case not every company can take the set

1212
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:44,359
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tote and be the first but</font>

1213
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:47,390
there has been some change in Korea

1214
01:01:44,359 --> 01:01:49,848
recently<font color="#CCCCCC"> cacao the biggest messaging app</font>

1215
01:01:47,390 --> 01:01:51,740
in the country released a great

1216
01:01:49,849 --> 01:01:55,670
transparency report it has awesome

1217
01:01:51,740 --> 01:02:03,560
visuals and really promote everyone to

1218
01:01:55,670 --> 01:02:06,700
take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that especially his dairy</font>

1219
01:02:03,560 --> 01:02:10,160
and he was giving more knowledge on how

1220
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:12,200
requests harmonized with physical

1221
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:16,129
searches like basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can go</font>

1222
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:19,098
fishing with requests on the internet so

1223
01:02:16,130 --> 01:02:21,080
as anybody know in terms of it relates

1224
01:02:19,099 --> 01:02:22,880
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> what kind of request even say you're</font>

1225
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:26,119
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to search your house you have to</font>

1226

have a warrant which<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> judicial</font>

1227
01:02:26,119 --> 01:02:31,220
oversight so it's digital lost our

1228
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:33,140
concern online is there anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wear a</font>

1229
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,819
gloss that look how to harmonize this

1230
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:39,730
event there's some sort of holy sites

1231
01:02:34,820 --> 01:02:39,730
and that leaders can be fishing Charles

1232
01:02:40,320 --> 01:02:43,830
a very great comment about this

1233
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:46,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">questionnaire actually also a previous</font>

1234
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:49,529
question I think because we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been</font>

1235
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:52,280
talking also about surveillance in my

1236
01:02:49,530 --> 01:02:55,470
observation about the Moors in Hong Kong

1237
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:57,720
actually physical searches or even

1238
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:59,730
surveillance in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the older sense of the</font>

1239
01:02:57,720 --> 01:03:02,609
words you know you know having a

1240
01:02:59,730 --> 01:03:05,520
binocular across the street and trying

1241
01:03:02,610 --> 01:03:08,310
to to watch over somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> while tapping</font>

1242
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:11,700
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the telephone and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so on those kind of</font>

1243
01:03:08,310 --> 01:03:14,370
things are very strictly regulated we

1244
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:17,220
have an ordinance in Hong Kong that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1245
01:03:14,370 --> 01:03:20,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">almost</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> old for interception of</font>

1246
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:24,209
communications and surveillance

1247
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:26,700
ordinance that an independent judge has

1248
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:29,250
a commission that the police and other

1249
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:30,779
law enforcement agency they are doing

1250
01:03:29,250 --> 01:03:33,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the solo things they have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to file</font>

1251
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:34,980
reports they have to apply and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font>

1252
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">subsequently they have to file report</font>

1253
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:40,470
every<font color="#CCCCCC"> year the Commissioner that the</font>

1254
01:03:37,050 --> 01:03:43,440
judge would issue a report stating the

1255
01:03:40,470 --> 01:03:46,919
violation cases and so on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> suggest</font>

1256
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:49,470
areas of improvement and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

1257
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:52,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">the traditional surveillance now comes</font>

1258
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:55,620
to the internet when we ask the

1259
01:03:52,740 --> 01:03:57,060
Commissioner last year what about things

1260
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:58,620
that have been happening on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1261
01:03:57,060 --> 01:04:00,509
are they is considered to be

1262
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:04,440
surveillance basically his answer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us</font>

1263
01:04:00,510 --> 01:04:06,510
is I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know and in the meantime we</font>

1264
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:08,160
see the<font color="#CCCCCC"> police and other people and</font>

1265
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:10,010
other law enforcement agencies being

1266
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:13,319
very liberal in trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

1267
01:04:10,010 --> 01:04:16,680
information from service providers we

1268
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:18,840
call them<font color="#E5E5E5"> requests for data you could</font>

1269
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:21,120
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> them surveillance as well we call</font>

1270
01:04:18,840 --> 01:04:23,610
them deletion request you could call

1271
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">them surveillance as well so that is the</font>

1272
01:04:23,610 --> 01:04:29,700
problem now the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> also is that</font>

1273
01:04:26,220 --> 01:04:31,709
when we come to establishing laws to try

1274
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,450
to regulate these kind of activities my

1275
01:04:31,710 --> 01:04:35,970
worry is that the global trend right now

1276
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:38,549
is setting up cyber security laws that

1277
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:40,410
are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to enforce give police even</font>

1278
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:42,540
more power rather than the other way

1279
01:04:40,410 --> 01:04:44,580
around and that is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> double-edged</font>

1280
01:04:42,540 --> 01:04:45,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">sword that we face you know we keep on</font>

1281
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,520
telling the government we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> received</font>

1282
01:04:45,990 --> 01:04:50,100
ease problems we think you should review

1283
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:52,069
the law but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> know in the back of our</font>

1284
01:04:50,100 --> 01:04:53,868
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> that necessarily risk</font>

1285
01:04:52,069 --> 01:04:55,819
taking when we tell the government to

1286
01:04:53,869 --> 01:04:57,829
reveal the laws because they might<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

1287
01:04:55,819 --> 01:04:59,839
the other way so that that is

1288
01:04:57,829 --> 01:05:01,849
unfortunately seems like with the global

1289
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:04,910
you no worries about all<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exciting</font>

1290
01:05:01,849 --> 01:05:06,890
terrorism and other load by you know

1291
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:09,469
please can easily show us crime figures

1292
01:05:06,890 --> 01:05:11,049
that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know oh the crimes brought on</font>

1293
01:05:09,469 --> 01:05:14,390
the Internet's been growing you know

1294
01:05:11,049 --> 01:05:15,529
fifty eighty percent a year of course

1295
01:05:14,390 --> 01:05:17,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know they don't do it on the</font>

1296
01:05:15,529 --> 01:05:19,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">telephone anymore so but but then again</font>

1297
01:05:17,630 --> 01:05:22,999
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it's easy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for them to use these</font>

1298
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:25,459
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of worries and public worries and</font>

1299
01:05:22,999 --> 01:05:27,348
so on to try to you know enforce even

1300
01:05:25,459 --> 01:05:30,019
stricter if they have a cybersecurity

1301
01:05:27,349 --> 01:05:32,269
know that that's the dilemma that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I face</font>

1302
01:05:30,019 --> 01:05:33,890
all the time you know do I<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell the</font>

1303
01:05:32,269 --> 01:05:36,140
government to do a review because I know

1304
01:05:33,890 --> 01:05:38,989
once they do it it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> come</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out even</font>

1305
01:05:36,140 --> 01:05:40,879
worse than right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now where it is just a</font>

1306
01:05:38,989 --> 01:05:43,339
bit of uncertainty and we try to

1307
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,989
navigate<font color="#E5E5E5"> around Berlin certainty but</font>

1308
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:46,910
once it's very certain it might be even

1309
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:50,949
worse I don't know so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font>

1310
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:50,949
I don't know I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the answer</font>

1311
01:05:51,249 --> 01:05:56,769
just a couple more questions here yeah

1312
01:05:53,719 --> 01:05:56,769
in the setting up

1313
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:11,920
so

1314
01:07:31,650 --> 01:07:36,360
so in terms of the trends of what the

1315
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:39,330
Iranian government is doing I don't have

1316
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:41,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the insights or the specifics about what</font>

1317
01:07:39,330 --> 01:07:43,740
what they're doing I know there's a lot

1318
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">of experts here focused on Iran and that</font>

1319
01:07:43,740 --> 01:08:04,500
type of technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure if it</font>

1320
01:07:45,330 --> 01:08:05,730
could help<font color="#E5E5E5"> out yeah this is so in terms</font>

1321
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:07,740
of specifics like that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just don't have</font>

1322
01:08:05,730 --> 01:08:09,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the details on the specifics of what the</font>

01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:14,940
questions about the sanctions that's

1326
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,149
again that it's not really my core area

1327
01:08:14,940 --> 01:08:20,100
of expertise but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are I work with</font>

1328
01:08:18,149 --> 01:08:21,450
many folks in the DC office and in

1329
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:24,060
California we're focused on<font color="#E5E5E5"> those issues</font>

1330
01:08:21,450 --> 01:08:29,910
and happy to get some satisfactory

1331
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:31,110
answers after this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks yeah I think</font>

1332
01:08:29,910 --> 01:08:33,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are great questions</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1333
01:08:31,109 --> 01:08:36,899
companies deciding to enter<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark gates</font>

1334
01:08:33,420 --> 01:08:38,670
and perhaps factoring in how transparent

1335
01:08:36,899 --> 01:08:41,670
they'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be that what happens</font>

1336
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:44,399
in those markets will thankful survey I

1337
01:08:41,670 --> 01:08:45,870
think we've just running out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of time and</font>

1338
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:49,830
I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to give our panelists one</font>

1339
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:52,890
last chance<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perhaps produce some</font>

1340
01:08:49,830 --> 01:08:58,470
outcomes or yeah requests from the

1341
01:08:52,890 --> 01:09:01,020
audience Thanks okay I think I got um

1342
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:04,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">also way to fit X from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the audience</font>

1343
01:09:01,020 --> 01:09:07,020
especially when some mentioned that so

1344
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:09,450
we can not only we need to such for

1345
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:12,110
pinging from the numbers the numbers

1346
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:16,109
<font color="#CCCCCC">cannot have us all and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> some audience</font>

1347
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:20,639
gave us a very good suggestions will so

1348
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:22,859
I request the promotions or for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the</font>

1349
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:27,290
cases<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the third law enforcement</font>

1350
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:30,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">law enforcement agencies can actually</font>

1351
01:09:27,290 --> 01:09:33,720
like a crack some cases because of the

1352
01:09:30,569 --> 01:09:36,740
dinadhi requested I think these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

1353
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:36,740
great advice

1354
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:49,318
you just like to tell how many companies

1355
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:52,710
can import the transparency report there

1356
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:55,739
is a limitation forcing them to perform

1357
01:09:52,710 --> 01:09:58,469
their social responsibility I think or

1358
01:09:55,739 --> 01:10:01,799
so that is a good way to but comparing

1359
01:09:58,469 --> 01:10:03,860
its<font color="#E5E5E5"> company them they move by benefit so</font>

1360
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:07,800
so we make them able to feel the

1361
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:09,929
consumers criticism for that<font color="#E5E5E5"> before that</font>

1362
01:10:07,800 --> 01:10:13,280
and we have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make the public</font>

1363
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:17,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested in the transparency of</font>

1364
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:21,330
company first for that we disclose not

1365
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:24,960
only number but also cases it's

1366
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:27,239
effective way that finding and inform

1367
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:30,260
the cases which revealing the series in

1368
01:10:27,239 --> 01:10:35,639
yourself as if surveillance or

1369
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:38,340
censorship in appropriate sensor when it

1370
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:41,310
comes to the individual problem which

1371
01:10:38,340 --> 01:10:44,850
probably can feel I might be<font color="#E5E5E5"> that target</font>

1372
01:10:41,310 --> 01:10:47,670
out in appropriate surveillance it can

1373
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:50,460
attract public attention easily i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1374
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:53,880
in korea after revealing the messenger

1375
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:56,460
service cases i mentioned before that

1376
01:10:53,880 --> 01:11:00,510
there were many people who work to

1377
01:10:56,460 --> 01:11:03,930
overseas message the Taliban which is

1378
01:11:00,510 --> 01:11:09,290
known<font color="#CCCCCC"> as that doesn't save conversation</font>

1379
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:13,560
on their server is this move like this

1380
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:17,040
can companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can brought companies</font>

1381
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:22,290
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> transpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> reporting practice I think</font>

1382
01:11:17,040 --> 01:11:24,000
thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> thanks I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the big</font>

1383
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:26,969
takeaway which I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciated was</font>

1384
01:11:24,000 --> 01:11:28,410
the but the fact the narrative is so

1385
01:11:26,969 --> 01:11:30,570
much more helpful than just the raw

1386
01:11:28,410 --> 01:11:33,389
numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> often times I think we just</font>

1387
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:35,309
released our legal process section on

1388
01:11:33,390 --> 01:11:36,810
transparency report that's when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

1389
01:11:35,310 --> 01:11:38,390
were like I get it now I feel more

1390
01:11:36,810 --> 01:11:41,489
comfortable<font color="#E5E5E5"> with how this process works</font>

1391
01:11:38,390 --> 01:11:42,840
I think us developing that section and

1392
01:11:41,489 --> 01:11:44,759
for other companies I'm sure we'll be

1393
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:46,530
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same should be head of our</font>

1394
01:11:44,760 --> 01:11:50,580
next focus<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is just breaking out</font>

1395
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:52,320
numbers even more I thing apart from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1396
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:54,600
agenda<font color="#E5E5E5"> public I we also have people more</font>

1397
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:56,489
among the companies as well and telling

1398
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:58,590
them that actually if they revisa

1399
01:11:56,489 --> 01:12:00,209
transparency report and they will

1400
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:02,730
attract more user that they can trust

1401
01:12:00,210 --> 01:12:04,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">them I only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in that way they can earn</font>

1402
01:12:02,730 --> 01:12:06,299
more money and there would be days or

1403
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:08,969
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive did you know we keep it</font>

1404
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:11,010
transfers<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's good</font>

1405
01:12:08,969 --> 01:12:12,560
yeah just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> follow-up I love to see</font>

1406
01:12:11,010 --> 01:12:16,610
companies make the business case for

1407
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:19,980
transparency to show the other investors

1408
01:12:16,610 --> 01:12:22,500
shareholders and their peers just how

1409
01:12:19,980 --> 01:12:25,709
important it is to release this data and

1410
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:27,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">this narrative so one last plug I like</font>

1411
01:12:25,710 --> 01:12:30,120
to say I'm access is transparency

1412
01:12:27,330 --> 01:12:32,510
reporting index<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been just newly</font>

1413
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:35,849
revamped with the help of on cheek and

1414
01:12:32,510 --> 01:12:39,949
we'll put<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> flyers out with some of</font>

1415
01:12:35,850 --> 01:12:39,949
the data so if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can all thank the</font>
