exactly how many negotiations are

have a little own section where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were</font>

discussion they might swing by and

471
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:47,810
listen to our discussions but we were

472
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:49,640
definitely at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not my point of</font>

00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:58,149
really wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that's what</font>

along with the asian carriers coalition

sure of course the telcos so a whole

507
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:32,460
bunch of meaning that companies like see

508
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:34,350
Microsoft HP now Simon heavily banded

together with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the telcos including AT&T</font>

510
00:22:34,350 --> 00:22:42,300
VT orange and we can memorize it and

511
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:45,000
came together to write a paper<font color="#E5E5E5"> on cloudy</font>

512
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:47,580
and of those we focused on the fact that

513
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:51,300
a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these regulations should come</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">up right now were preventing business</font>

515
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:55,200
from happening we're preventing

embassies meeting<font color="#CCCCCC"> small and medium</font>

518
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:01,170
enterprises meaning global global

519
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,139
companies it prevented from actually

520
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:06,570
moving into this global trade flows

521
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:08,370
because it went quite sure if they were

522
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:10,350
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be on the wrong side of the law</font>

523
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:12,659
so we decided that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

524
00:23:10,350 --> 00:23:14,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">right write this paper and tell and</font>

525
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:16,470
lobbying the government government

policymakers<font color="#CCCCCC"> e-government</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look you've</font>

527
00:23:16,470 --> 00:23:21,690
got all these very good legislation or

528
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,700
not is this all very strong very good

529
00:23:21,690 --> 00:23:25,860
for consumers however it's sort of

530
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:30,930
killing the businesses your local

531
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:33,209
businesses call because in order<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it</font>

532
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:35,490
happened you need to meet is well

533
00:23:33,210 --> 00:23:38,100
established for cross-pollinated

534
00:23:35,490 --> 00:23:40,350
transfers so we wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> this how we took</font>

535
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,209
it on the way nice the<font color="#E5E5E5"> roadshow around</font>

536
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:43,290
the region to tell them tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

537
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:46,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">government's head and they were</font>

538
00:23:43,290 --> 00:23:50,070
unappreciative of it and obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

539
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:52,800
asked could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you show us a copy of</font>

540
00:23:50,070 --> 00:23:54,300
as well<font color="#E5E5E5"> but of course region haven't you</font>

541
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,250
got there because obviously those

542
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,870
discussions of secret<font color="#CCCCCC"> however they said</font>

543
00:23:56,250 --> 00:24:00,000
didn't say that they would take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

544
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:04,590
consideration and I knew this as the

545
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,440
rhythms of what what goes on in the

546
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:09,840
trade negotiation or point anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in my</font>

547
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:12,510
policy situation where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

548
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,639
to do your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own a bit to contribute to e</font>

549
00:24:12,510 --> 00:24:16,230
to the discussion that's going on and

550
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:17,730
then perhaps it's because I'm

551
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:20,550
Singaporean so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite understand</font>

552
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:25,110
this idea of democracy if you already

553
00:24:20,550 --> 00:24:27,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">vote for people but they I think that</font>

554
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:29,580
this is really the role that<font color="#CCCCCC"> trained it</font>

555
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:33,230
because tricking sociation against it

556
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:35,429
acca that's what we do and be the

557
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:38,130
coroner into that is a lot of the

558
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:39,750
government's working on on seeing what

559
00:24:38,130 --> 00:24:42,900
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> say about empowering</font>

560
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:45,420
the local communities so we said well we

561
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:49,440
think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number 1 pages for the power</font>

741
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,000
so it's really complicated to engage is

00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,030
the US which has very clear until<font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

only that is be made in order to stop

758

copyright infringement but it will

759
00:32:44,390 --> 00:32:47,000
actually a really chilling effect on

people putting them under surveillance

761
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:52,130
because it requires I speak money toward

just so it really very form of

and by company and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> do not matter</font>

actually undermine all the trade agenda

surveillance through the trade because

806
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:38,330
we've seen the impact of surveillance if

807
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:39,830
I didn't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fundamental right three</font>

former surveillance needs to be

debate thank you<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty much is still</font>

813
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:56,680
and I realized<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I neglected to</font>

814
00:34:55,330 --> 00:34:58,930
introduce myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the beginning said</font>

00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:00,330
oh man my name is Jeremy Martin I work

<font color="#CCCCCC">for the electronic frontier foundation</font>

trade agreement and their impact to the

00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:13,600
digital wives so even<font color="#E5E5E5"> moderator I have a</font>

820
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:14,859
privilege of asking the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first question I</font>

821
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:18,160
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's not going to clean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

822
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:21,280
privilege so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to drink this to</font>

823
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:24,299
man and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> about where you draw the</font>

824
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,730
line between legitimate data protection

825
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:31,630
regulations and what you may see as

826
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:36,490
illegitimate infringement on pre-trail

827
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:38,950
so I saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the example grabs of local</font>

828
00:35:36,490 --> 00:35:41,799
hosting members so if there is a country

829
00:35:38,950 --> 00:35:43,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has work that requires certain</font>

830
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,450
types of personal data to be stored

831
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:49,300
within the country on servers that host

832
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:50,680
to do the argument<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that that there</font>

833
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:54,640
may be necessary to protect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

834
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,520
from interception perhaps under foreign

835
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,620
governments by foreign governments or

836
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:03,100
even by other corporations on overseas

837
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:06,370
networks so is that necessarily an

838
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:09,120
illegitimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> main is this song is there</font>

839
00:36:06,370 --> 00:36:12,549
no basis for that or there's nothing

840
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:14,380
absolutely I think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is up for</font>

841
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:15,700
debate where that line is drawn is

842
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:17,380
Africa me and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that's where</font>

843
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,569
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think governments and civil society</font>

844
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:22,570
and corporations need to work together

to<font color="#CCCCCC"> might not wear that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> zone is now I</font>

them to be making trade agreements

851

around technology that often stretches

00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:44,319
the capacity of government officials

853
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:46,870
just a shade too far you're asking

we held a discussion with the industry

can help advise matters that have to do

883
00:37:55,239 --> 00:37:59,109
with technology or have at least a

884
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:00,759
technical partner that they can think

885
00:37:59,109 --> 00:38:02,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">and a trust a technical partner that's a</font>

886
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,999
neutral party that can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> that advise on</font>

887
00:38:02,469 --> 00:38:05,739
these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to answer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your question</font>

888
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:07,269
directly where you going to draw the

889
00:38:05,739 --> 00:38:09,400
line<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that governments themselves</font>

890
00:38:07,269 --> 00:38:12,399
need to decide<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're in trouble and it</font>

891
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,249
is their<font color="#E5E5E5"> job to do so that's that's the</font>

892
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,819
members<font color="#E5E5E5"> of government to actually burn</font>

893
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:22,538
so how do they can I think that goes

894
00:38:18,819 --> 00:38:23,769
into a wide myriad of both different

895
00:38:22,539 --> 00:38:27,009
types of governance structure is

896
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:29,229
Singapore for these different ways we

897
00:38:27,009 --> 00:38:30,489
did that discussion needs to start I

898
00:38:29,229 --> 00:38:33,788
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the government needs to find</font>

899
00:38:30,489 --> 00:38:35,469
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> way to bridge that technical knowledge</font>

900
00:38:33,789 --> 00:38:36,880
gap before they can actually really

901
00:38:35,469 --> 00:38:39,400
answer their questions so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

902
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:41,289
where the line should be drawn it should

903
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,049
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> drawn it should be drawn with</font>

904
00:38:41,289 --> 00:38:47,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">consultation where it will ultimately</font>

905
00:38:44,049 --> 00:38:49,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">guy is a matter of debate for each</font>

906
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:55,390
different country to start the

907
00:38:49,569 --> 00:39:01,029
discussion and<font color="#CCCCCC"> justification</font>

908
00:38:55,390 --> 00:39:03,549
well events like<font color="#CCCCCC"> me actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> gets</font>

909
00:39:01,029 --> 00:39:06,490
something and she's a key in a lot of

910
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:09,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">hearing agreements that rare beings that</font>

911
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:10,660
are being discussed at the moment and I

912
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,578
think there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a difference to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> made</font>

913
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:14,828
me change first at a localization which

914
00:39:12,579 --> 00:39:17,200
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the type of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> force a television</font>

919
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:28,869
the localization requirement for data

920
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,899
protection purposes which included only

921
00:39:28,869 --> 00:39:34,630
a limited version of data that needs to

922
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:39,490
be stored in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a partnership or high data</font>

923
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:42,220
protection standards that means that we

924
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:45,430
raised to be for some time are you

925
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:49,019
located in a specific area but is that

00:39:45,430 --> 00:39:52,450

00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,859
need to be you and then we are agreement

<font color="#CCCCCC">that I can be transferred so yes that is</font>

935
00:40:10,089 --> 00:40:18,160
preferably sorting arrow to ensure my

936
00:40:13,529 --> 00:40:19,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">connection that I think expose up just</font>

937
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:21,490
for style organization which require

938
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:23,799
everything is to say everything wrong

939
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:26,740
place yeah but that's exactly that's

940
00:40:23,799 --> 00:40:29,160
exactly the point because<font color="#CCCCCC"> how you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

941
00:40:26,740 --> 00:40:31,808
at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language that is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out of</font>

942
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:33,848
places like Vietnam this is like

943
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:36,220
Indonesia if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking at the</font>

944
00:40:33,849 --> 00:40:39,759
vegetation is coming up they are so vain

945
00:40:36,220 --> 00:40:43,509
it is it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the language of Vietnam is</font>

946
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:46,029
all public services should have<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

947
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:49,000
because static are leaders in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> story</font>

948
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:51,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">with in Vietnam you should not and it's</font>

949
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,049
that broad and I look at the language I

950
00:40:51,369 --> 00:40:54,450
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really think that this person who</font>

951
00:40:53,049 --> 00:40:56,490
produce section

952
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:58,319
and this is a move some of the

953
00:40:56,490 --> 00:41:00,569
legislation from India which came out

954
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:03,390
about a year<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year and a half to three</font>

955
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:05,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">years ago in India when they the</font>

residency with his discussion around the

residence he came so they're coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

958
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:12,450
in Southeast Asia the legislation

Indian here just talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> people say</font>

963
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:24,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so when the female gets wrong</font>

964
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:26,790
number packets it's going to open data

965
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:29,640
and cast<font color="#CCCCCC"> him in it so instead of writing</font>

966
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:32,279
the writing is that that our meeting is

967
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,410
I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that government is because</font>

968
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,869
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what they're doing so I mean</font>

969
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:38,759
they need people like you and hopefully

970
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:41,910
people my baby see if you go<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically</font>

971
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,609
go in and you know help them figure out

972
00:41:41,910 --> 00:41:46,649
exactly how<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so when the acca</font>

973
00:41:44,609 --> 00:41:48,390
what we're working on right now we just

974
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:50,010
launched a about two weeks ago we're

975
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:53,190
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the project call it data</font>

976
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:56,040
classification project it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a way in</font>

977
00:41:53,190 --> 00:41:59,310
which<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can classify sudden activity is</font>

978
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,980
so that they can move over board is

979
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:04,650
easily so we've got we've seen some of

980
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,410
that type of classification to be

981
00:42:04,650 --> 00:42:09,510
happening<font color="#E5E5E5"> financial data is classified a</font>

982
00:42:07,410 --> 00:42:12,328
national native<font color="#E5E5E5"> national secrecy</font>

983
00:42:09,510 --> 00:42:14,760
obviously classified we've got credit

984
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:16,980
ratings for example a great example of

985
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,440
how classified can move within very

986
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:21,150
strict parameters of secrecy and

987
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:22,770
encryption how to move it over<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

988
00:42:21,150 --> 00:42:24,390
polar coordinate or so we're working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

989
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:27,390
the other classification exercise where

990
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,339
we can say mean this is one way to go hi

991
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:30,750
government's community and we'd like to

992
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:36,060
consider and we were<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to be</font>

993
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:37,829
helpful partners that discussion so I'm

994
00:42:36,060 --> 00:42:39,509
going attention to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pennell that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started</font>

995
00:42:37,829 --> 00:42:42,000
to the floor I mean just one moment but

996
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,010
I'm also going to give I jezik one bite

997
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:47,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the cherry six other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comments to have</font>

998
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:51,150
spoken again so do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

999
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,790
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> any legitimate role for Internet</font>

1001
00:42:53,790 --> 00:43:00,720
agreements for our trade agreements the

1002
00:42:56,069 --> 00:43:04,560
wrong people course like i<font color="#CCCCCC"> said i'm not</font>

1003
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">an expert in the field but working or so</font>

1004
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:10,269
many<font color="#E5E5E5"> years on the looking at bay</font>

1005
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:14,019
mins as you said it has more from a

1006
00:43:10,269 --> 00:43:18,308
simple new<font color="#CCCCCC"> acquaintances tool to</font>

1007
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:22,180
regulate addiction to a more all

1008
00:43:18,309 --> 00:43:24,220
powerful instrument already and there

1009
00:43:22,180 --> 00:43:28,118
are discussions over here spot to

1010
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:31,538
include labor standards environmental

1011
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:35,470
standards and I think in this case I

1012
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:40,150
agree<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the path discussion there are</font>

1013
00:43:35,470 --> 00:43:42,848
certain technical expertise that are

1014
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:47,170
really far<font color="#CCCCCC"> behind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> capacity of our</font>

1015
00:43:42,849 --> 00:43:49,210
competency negotiators but in response

1016
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">to that earlier question I think we have</font>

1017
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:55,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">to look at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> whole way by which trade</font>

1018
00:43:52,390 --> 00:44:01,420
negotiations are preceded really in

1019
00:43:55,809 --> 00:44:03,160
again almost total secrecy and lack<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1020
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:05,470
public participation so we have to

1021
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:08,828
address those concerns whether you're

1022
00:44:05,470 --> 00:44:10,450
discussing issues with pertaining to

1023
00:44:08,829 --> 00:44:13,240
fish at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> for example or word</font>

1024
00:44:10,450 --> 00:44:16,149
whether you're discussing digital

1025
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:18,788

1026

address those fundamental points

1027
00:44:18,789 --> 00:44:24,069
fundamental weaknesses in the way they

including those who have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

1032
00:44:32,470 --> 00:44:41,200

1033
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:45,670
think because it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually it's a new</font>

00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,700

website some of the documents are

1369

1452
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:26,730

1454
01:04:26,730 --> 01:04:30,360
something which i think is helping to

push that discussion help me to<font color="#E5E5E5"> push it</font>

1458
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:40,830
a moment we could actually hold an

entire which are just on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to</font>

1462
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:51,270
transparency we do have to wait long is

1463
01:04:48,600 --> 01:04:53,730
actually at the national level so each

1464
01:04:51,270 --> 01:04:55,320
government has a certain amount of

1465
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:57,210
communication that it does and it

1466
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,920
consults with celebratory instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> calls</font>

1467
01:04:57,210 --> 01:05:01,350
so a lot of the controversy about

1468
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:05,100
business interests having unfair access

1469
01:05:01,350 --> 01:05:08,009
to the text because<font color="#E5E5E5"> US government has a</font>

1470
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:09,509
set of committees where industry

01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:11,340

privileged access to the text in those

1473
01:05:11,340 --> 01:05:14,190

01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:18,210
has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> established for that he</font>

1475
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:20,580
compared to hole and so I wonder just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1476
01:05:18,210 --> 01:05:22,410
follow on from<font color="#CCCCCC"> a previous discussion</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1477
01:05:20,580 --> 01:05:25,830
any of the panelists think that there is

1478
01:05:22,410 --> 01:05:28,049
scope or are we building the framework

1479
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:30,000
for negotiating trade agreements in a

1480
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:33,300
way that is more globally appropriate

1481
01:05:30,000 --> 01:05:36,480
and isn't based on this piecemeal so

1482
01:05:33,300 --> 01:05:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">nation by nation transparency we were</font>

1487
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:54,029
actually for this lack of transparency

1488
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:55,890
no because it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> too</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> open I think that</font>

I would actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> help you any people</font>

1497
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:16,560
that's it not going where the low

1498
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,900
because I are no understanding

1499
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:21,480
europe in the US and minimization it's

1500
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:22,920
like involve do not trust what we are

1502
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:27,780
good to me so of course there is many

1503
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:29,819
misconception that<font color="#CCCCCC"> some from the moment</font>

arise because everything needs to be

kept secret in each time someone asked

1506
01:06:31,350 --> 01:06:36,450
the question is like just trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course if you talk to European group</font>

level of transparency that is fair but

1550
01:08:26,979 --> 01:08:33,939
of course whether or not the inputs from

1551
01:08:32,109 --> 01:08:35,649
civil society or social movements

directly to dr. governments and when we

certain level of discussions and

1574
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:34,960

between<font color="#CCCCCC"> a normal</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> consultation in too</font>

1592
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,070
much consultation is a real challenge

1593
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,480
for those of you at visit Japan if

envelope 30 tack board and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

1598
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:36,980
because the farmer it didn't Japan have

1599
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:40,250
said that that is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a patch for growing</font>

1600
01:10:36,980 --> 01:10:43,610
rice and because the logging crews are

1601
01:10:40,250 --> 01:10:47,720
so strong there is a patch of grass in

1602

1607
01:10:56,510 --> 01:11:04,340
that's too much consultation I hope that
