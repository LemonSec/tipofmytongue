00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:41,609
going to ask our speakers how this are

51
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:43,650
the access to Internet has improved the

52
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:47,370
protection of human rights freedom of

53
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:51,870
expression etc so I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to first</font>

54
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:54,750
start on the topic<font color="#CCCCCC"> of how specific</font>

55
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,530
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> representatives</font>

57
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:06,840
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> access in their respective</font>

58
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:08,579
location hi<font color="#CCCCCC"> thanks indonesian we</font>

59
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,739
actually started in<font color="#E5E5E5"> senate in 1994 and</font>

60
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,000
what's interesting about it different

61
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:14,880
from other countries like Singapore is

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,100
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> university started it so it wasn't</font>

63
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:19,560
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one has no idea with what the</font>

64
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,840
internet was and we developed<font color="#CCCCCC"> it on our</font>

65
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,260
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the government did not</font>

66
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,410
understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the internet is so back</font>

67
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,510
in 1997 we<font color="#E5E5E5"> created an internet exchange</font>

68
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:34,370
that connects everything in<font color="#CCCCCC"> region into</font>

69
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:40,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">one single router and about that time</font>

70
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:42,870
are also<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard though Reggie was at the</font>

71
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:45,390
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> peak of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> his power and he senses</font>

72
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,730
everything in radio television

73
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:50,518
everything he knows except the internet

74
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,380
so by using the internet the students

75
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:55,890
actually managed to organize and<font color="#E5E5E5"> revolt</font>

76
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,709
had toppled out a government which was

77
00:03:55,890 --> 00:04:02,549
amazing<font color="#CCCCCC"> so ever</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> since then we strongly</font>

78
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:04,050
believe that the people has the right to

79
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,360
control the internet because government

80
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:09,750
changes that people will still remain

81
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:14,269
the people and about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the costs of the</font>

82
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:17,130
internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> which we have significantly</font>

83
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,840
maybe have the price reviews it's

84
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:20,238
because for

85
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:23,179
day one since the internet was started

86
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:25,130
like 497<font color="#CCCCCC"> Devon cage we have the open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

87
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,650
see now which connects everything is

88
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,810
free I mean you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to pay</font>

89
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,109
anything you don't have to sign a

90
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:35,120
contract nothing everyone<font color="#CCCCCC"> connects to a</font>

91
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,570
single internet exchange hence that

92
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">means big companies like the telcos</font>

93
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:45,310
startup companies like the content

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:48,710
provider connects to the same device and

95
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:55,070
because of that all you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay for</font>

96
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:59,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">is your last mile lake in Indonesia so</font>

97
00:04:55,070 --> 00:05:03,500
our uniqueness is in other countries the

98
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:07,550
internet is your glass mile and your

99
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:10,039
international traffic so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> how much</font>

100
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:15,160
you pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the internet in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Indonesia we</font>

101
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:18,620
have lots of local content and we have a

102
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:22,610
internet cafe who will subscribe a last

103
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:25,700
mile<font color="#E5E5E5"> leased line link at ten makes but</font>

104
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:28,910
only subscribe 64 k international link

105
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,880
because we know for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fact that local</font>

106
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,000
content is free and there is no blocking

107
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,370
between the operators and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the content</font>

108
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,979
providers and that reduces the price

109
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:42,260
significantly we<font color="#E5E5E5"> even have a nice view</font>

110
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:44,950
that connects to be open XD but does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

111
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:47,960
subscribe to have any international lake

112
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:50,120
so they can simply just sell the

113
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:51,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> users without having</font>

114
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:55,370
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pay anything to the overnights feet</font>

115
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:57,440
so that's the price reduction the access

116
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:00,020
is another thing because we're very

117
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:03,169
creative even managed to have this

118
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:05,000
village map a<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair way method of roughly</font>

119
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:09,430
it'sit's village now we're all this

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:12,560
village people not<font color="#CCCCCC"> their singing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> group</font>

121
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:15,590
the people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> village mix it</font>

122
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:17,630
together they put switches in different

123
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:19,880
parts of the village they pull ethernet

124
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,889
cables and so all the houses are

125
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:25,250
connected together then they make this

126
00:06:21,889 --> 00:06:28,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">wireless 2.4 watch and garlic which is a</font>

127
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:31,440

128
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">piece and they have internet</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

129
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,560
which the government regularly cracks

130
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,419
down because it's illegal to do so but

131
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:40,920
yes we do everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can to reduce</font>

132
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:44,640
the internet price because we do want

133
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:47,760
the information and are only hurdle

134
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:54,110

158
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:57,570
here is that we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a support</font>

159
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:59,040
from the government we don't have it

such violence or such small projects

164
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:13,140
which are already done by committees so

access so access is free<font color="#CCCCCC"> union but the</font>

166
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:20,250
access is the major seventy percent of

briefly when how Pakistan is connected

or not connected so the thirty percent

200

of the population is supposed to have

any kind of information it's not

just the internet but also they are

228

deprived access to the mainstream<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

229
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,900
which makes internet all the<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

important and yet these two are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

areas where<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet spheres the lowest</font>

242
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,420
it's also there are there questions

243
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:46,130
about the sincerity of the government's

will to provide

<font color="#E5E5E5">amount of money they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are supposed to pay</font>

that is supposed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be put in the</font>

00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:04,579
accessibility park and the government

251
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:06,259
originally supposed to use sad funk to

252
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:08,479
ensure universal access is available

253
00:12:06,259 --> 00:12:10,370
however the government especially the

254
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,199
present government has done box honest

255
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:14,689
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> pull all that money the accessibility</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">can't pull it into a larger development</font>

257
00:12:14,689 --> 00:12:19,189
can and use that<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to pay off</font>

circular<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> energy sector so</font>

money that was given by telcos money

260
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:26,810
that in the end the end consumer is

261
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,089
paying for to ensure that access moves

262
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:32,589
out of urban centers is being used to

263
00:12:29,089 --> 00:12:35,860
pay for electricity so it<font color="#CCCCCC"> pillar that</font>

264
00:12:32,589 --> 00:12:38,600
and then the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't stop here</font>

265
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:40,250
it's not just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like Alexis but access to</font>

270
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:54,199
my mind it's incidents that have focus

271
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,420
that have completely framed the debate

272

in the National<font color="#CCCCCC"> Assembly and we're in</font>

videos on local service without you in

294
00:13:47,449 --> 00:13:51,620
understanding how it completely goes

295
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,540
against the principles of nationality

296
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,670
during the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world cup different calicos</font>

obviously for public is good

you know if you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that getting</font>

302
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:08,800
free<font color="#CCCCCC"> Twitter so the debate is this there</font>

303
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,300
is no debate instead people<font color="#CCCCCC"> are kind of</font>

304
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:13,810
celebrating the fact that they're

00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so in the Philippines I'm sure</font>

309
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:30,370
you've already<font color="#CCCCCC"> noticed how how bad is in</font>

310
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:34,060
service is here so I'm gonna elaborate

311
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,570
on that like Indonesia government really

312
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:40,709
has you know no knowledge of how

313
00:14:36,570 --> 00:14:44,230
telecommunications and ICT actually work

314
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:45,610
the private sector is the dominant telco

315
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:47,890
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippines they've always been</font>

316
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:52,960
it has<font color="#E5E5E5"> always been like that for several</font>

317
00:14:47,890 --> 00:14:55,630
decades the incumbent<font color="#CCCCCC"> alco which rolled</font>

318
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:57,700
out the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national which owns the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> national</font>

319
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,250
backbone owns everything from the

320
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:02,290
international gateway facilities to the

321
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:04,560
back bow to the last mile it is always

322
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:07,170
been the case so if you're a competitor

323
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:09,099
if you want to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the market</font>

324
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:11,310
telecommunications market you'll have to

325
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:15,210
deal with the widow telco that has

326
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:17,469
entrenched not only investments but also

327
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:19,960
political and financial interests as

328
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:23,290
well so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philippines seems to have a</font>

329
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:25,870
penchant for advertising that we want

330
00:15:23,290 --> 00:15:28,180
investors but then we set up all all

331
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:30,100
sorts of barriers for investors to<font color="#E5E5E5"> come</font>

332
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,469
in I don't know if that's unique to our

333
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:36,100
country<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that does not work for us so</font>

334
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:39,490
far the second largest carrier which is

335
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:43,680
globe came in about I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

336
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:49,020
nineteen late 1990s and it was the first

337
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:52,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">carrier to actually introduce SMS and</font>

338
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,210
since the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SMS was introduced</font>

339
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:59,470
as it was for free at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> time mobile</font>

340
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:02,920
phone penetration went up and later on

341
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:04,420
the convent<font color="#CCCCCC"> pldt which now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> own smart</font>

342
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,209
which is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> largest mobile service</font>

343
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:09,099
provider followed suit and then they I

344
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:13,260
don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> they just decided we'll</font>

345
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">charge for SMS so now it's not free um</font>

346
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,380
so I

347
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:20,450
is why is it's the private sector<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

348
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:22,970
basically providing access but recently

349
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:26,300
the government to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ICT office is</font>

350
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:28,700
trying to provide access to supposedly

351
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,250
provide access to unserved and

352
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:33,830
underserved areas to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the free Wi-Fi</font>

353
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:37,550
project but there has been some

354
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:40,850
discussions there are consultations

355
00:16:37,550 --> 00:16:44,439
happening because right now as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

356
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:47,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">found out the focus will be primarily</font>

357
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:48,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">metropolitan or burn areas which which</font>

358
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:52,550
actually defeats the purpose of having a

359
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:56,120
universal access program so because if

360
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:59,300
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the general scheme of days</font>

361
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:01,190
if the private telcos are already

362
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,740
serving an area why would government we

363
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:08,990
invest in that particular area so in

364
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:11,260
terms of access up around thirty thirty

365
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:14,900
seven percent of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Filipinos are online</font>

366
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:16,849
but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned</font>

367
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,790
earlier and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't a joke we have</font>

368
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:23,419
more facebook users than internet users

369
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:26,480
so there there seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a confusion</font>

370
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:28,940
already in<font color="#E5E5E5"> terms of what the internet is</font>

371
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:32,180
and how that differentiates from zero

372
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:34,760
rated content and I think there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

373
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:37,550
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you look at zero rated</font>

374
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:39,410
content as your solution to<font color="#E5E5E5"> universal</font>

375
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:44,570
access because there are a lot of

376
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:46,580
implications in terms of what how<font color="#CCCCCC"> does</font>

377
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:48,200
how do these providers make money out of

378
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:52,610
the data that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they collect from people</font>

379
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:55,520
and whether that<font color="#E5E5E5"> could actually in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

380
00:17:52,610 --> 00:17:57,800
long run be a not beneficial because you

381
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:00,320
are baking the market absolutely smaller

382
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:03,500
than its you know that it should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

383
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:07,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">because the first the first provider</font>

384
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,590
already has busy with cover the

385
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,209
population and then no other engines

386
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:13,280
could come in of course that would be

387
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:15,920
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business the logical business model</font>

388
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:20,480
that will make sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I were you know</font>

389
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:23,240
the Facebook for example so quality wise

390
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,850
we have one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the poorest in terms of</font>

else affordability well obviously if you

420
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:53,389
come if you actually have let's say

421
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:56,030
1,000 pesos you can only<font color="#E5E5E5"> get one MVPs</font>

here that's how bad it is that's 22

you're making<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 thousand pesos a month</font>

00:20:22,670 --> 00:20:28,070
there's definitely something wrong in

now to talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the any initiatives</font>

435
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:34,910
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mozilla might have in in terms of</font>

436
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:36,320
improving internet access sure so let me

437
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:39,320
put<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into context a little bit I</font>

438
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">think we talked about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of the I</font>

439
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the most important and the most</font>

440
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:46,019
high-profile aspects of the broader

441
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:48,360
challenge of improving access we've

442
00:20:46,019 --> 00:20:50,039
talked about infrastructure which is one

443
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:52,379
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most important one of the hardest</font>

444
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,600
we've talked about government role in a

445
00:20:52,379 --> 00:20:56,939
couple respects on in censorship and one

446
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:59,039
in sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> subsidization and provision</font>

447
00:20:56,940 --> 00:21:00,600
regulations and we started to talk a bit

448
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,220
about the economies of scale through the

449
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,080
references to zero rating so this is a

450
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,999
good landscape I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to help flesh it</font>

451
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:07,259
out a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit by talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about a</font>

452
00:21:05,999 --> 00:21:09,509
couple of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that Mozilla is</font>

453
00:21:07,259 --> 00:21:12,539
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing working with with many carriers in</font>

454
00:21:09,509 --> 00:21:15,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">Southeast Asia and others as well so the</font>

455
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,850
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one is the idea that we don't just</font>

456
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:20,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to connect people to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

457
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:23,549
we want to empower them to create and

458
00:21:20,909 --> 00:21:26,129
control their internet experience so

459
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:27,480
what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that require in practice well</font>

460
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,519
the way that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we think about this is</font>

461
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:32,429
people need to have smartphones a

00:21:29,519 --> 00:21:34,740
feature<font color="#E5E5E5"> phone is not a good device for</font>

463
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:36,450
generating Internet content we're really

464
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,159
taking<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> full benefits</font>

465
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:39,990
the Internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> has to offer if it's all</font>

466
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,429
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> get it's still</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a good tool you</font>

467
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:44,220
can still communicate with it you can

00:21:41,429 --> 00:21:45,779
load certain apps users and websites but

469
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,309
to really take advantage of the internet

470
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:49,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">and to help try to close the digital</font>

divide people<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to have smartphones</font>

472
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,220
so we've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working on this for a</font>

00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,689
couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of years we wrote our an</font>

476
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:01,320

477
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:03,809
device partners and carriers to deliver

478
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:05,700

Philippines working with cherry mobile

482
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:15,869
we have a $23 Firefox OS powered

483

smartphone which were very<font color="#E5E5E5"> proud</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of but</font>

484
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:19,230
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not just about giving people cones</font>

485
00:22:17,429 --> 00:22:21,929
either it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about the devices</font>

486
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:24,809
it's also about letting them create

487
00:22:21,929 --> 00:22:27,509
content letting them generate locally

488
00:22:24,809 --> 00:22:29,460
relevant content so that they perceive

489
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:33,149
that it's their internet and that it's

490
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:35,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just Western world or just American</font>

491
00:22:33,149 --> 00:22:37,018
apps and content that they can

492
00:22:35,399 --> 00:22:39,178
appreciate but it can really be theirs

493
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:41,279
so we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> tap into things like Joe</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Karzai XP in Indonesia where they've</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Mozilla has our web maker</font>

503
00:22:55,470 --> 00:23:00,130
we have built tools for people to make

00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:01,900
it easier for them to generate web pages

505
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,640

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue is is how do you deal</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">three weeks</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago and we're going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

deploying Firefox OS phones through the

524
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:46,209
see your rating this is subsidized

525
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet access amen and there's a lot</font>

526
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:49,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different reasons why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

527
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:52,030
happening this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're not</font>

528
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,530
subsidizing this this is orange

529
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:55,389
subsidizing this and part of this is

530
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:58,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to really do</font>

531
00:23:55,390 --> 00:24:00,340
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> help connect the next billion</font>

532
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,500
users and part of it is that they want

533
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,090
to bootstrap these<font color="#CCCCCC"> markets oh I don't</font>

534
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:06,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get into economies of scale</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

535
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,010
much depth but there's a high fixed cost

536
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:10,990
to building out a mobile network and

537
00:24:09,010 --> 00:24:13,270
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> the additional marginal cost of</font>

538
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:16,030
each user after that is relatively low

539
00:24:13,270 --> 00:24:17,950
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is to subsidize people up</font>

540
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:20,080
from get a bunch of users on the network

541
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:23,440
and hopefully a bunch of them will

542
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:25,629
continue to pay and by starting<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

543
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:28,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that larger number you don't have to</font>

544
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:29,950
charge them as much as you did if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

545
00:24:28,270 --> 00:24:31,900
started with a smaller number because

546
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:33,850
the fixed costs can be distributed<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

547
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:36,040
little bit more evenly so there's both a

548
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:37,600
sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a mission here of let's try to</font>

549
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,070
connect and exploiting people and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

550
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">just a realistic like costs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in economy</font>

551
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:45,429
economics argument about how do you get

552
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:47,650
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the point where the network makes</font>

553
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:50,590
sense and where people can hopefully pay

554
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:52,270
less to get their data so different

555
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,590
things different pieces as<font color="#CCCCCC"> possible i</font>

556
00:24:52,270 --> 00:24:54,940
think complimenting me the

557
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:58,149
infrastructure in the government whole

558
00:24:54,940 --> 00:25:01,870
narrative so as we've tried<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font>

559
00:24:58,150 --> 00:25:04,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">about EDC initiatives yeah and when I</font>

560
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:06,219
want to bring here is the more

561
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:08,168
experience outside of the region we do

562
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:10,960
work individually um

563
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:12,759
that's death also it's a member<font color="#CCCCCC"> APC</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

564
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:14,830
one of the things there's two things I

565
00:25:12,759 --> 00:25:17,830
guess I want to look at one is in

566
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:19,989
relation to digital migration so the

567
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,480
policy is what we do is we do research

568
00:25:19,989 --> 00:25:24,340
around digital migration for example one

569
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the things we did in Africa is sort</font>

570
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:29,350
of a comparative study of what the

571
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:31,720
country's policies are in migrating from

572
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:34,029
analog to digital and what what are the

573
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:36,759
costs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are the public access</font>

574
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:39,190
issues where you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at migration</font>

575
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:41,289
so that I think it's useful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

576
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:42,879
countries Philippines is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean all</font>

577
00:25:41,289 --> 00:25:46,149
countries like we are moving towards

578
00:25:42,879 --> 00:25:52,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">that um cool so I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there definitely</font>

579
00:25:46,149 --> 00:25:55,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">are consultation issues in relation to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">whose voices should be included in the</font>

00:25:55,869 --> 00:26:00,039
policy-making and as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as public</font>

582
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:02,739
access the pizza be<font color="#E5E5E5"> including that end</font>

583
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:05,200
costs as well and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is if</font>

584
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:07,749
question around connecting them then

585
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:11,820
next billion one of the things also that

586
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:14,590
were involved it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is in in an IP use</font>

589
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:23,889

00:26:21,129 --> 00:26:26,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">area</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they focus on gender</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in broadband</font>

591
00:26:23,889 --> 00:26:29,830
and no line of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile operators now</font>

592
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:31,809
are looking at<font color="#CCCCCC"> women's mark and</font>

593
00:26:29,830 --> 00:26:33,639
realizing that while you know if been

594
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:36,009
saying this all along right that more

595
00:26:33,639 --> 00:26:37,779
women are not connected there's there's

596
00:26:36,009 --> 00:26:40,389
sort of this equality around that but

597
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:44,109
now they've seen us<font color="#E5E5E5"> really a market for</font>

598
00:26:40,389 --> 00:26:46,059
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> these some push around mobiles and I</font>

599
00:26:44,109 --> 00:26:48,009
think when you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about this in</font>

600
00:26:46,059 --> 00:26:52,049
relation to looking at Polly's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interview</font>

601
00:26:48,009 --> 00:26:54,190
program and and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to how to</font>

602
00:26:52,049 --> 00:26:57,700
program that I think the field also

603
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:59,499
beyond just women being markets because

604
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,509
they really are other issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

605
00:26:59,499 --> 00:27:05,049
need to think of in relation to to act

606
00:27:01,509 --> 00:27:06,759
women's APIs and related to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

607
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:09,519
be around language for example I mean

608
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:11,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> singing out as internet that that</font>

609
00:27:09,519 --> 00:27:14,470
you're joining power people around the

610
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:16,450
kind of the internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> and that we own the</font>

611
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:18,849
infinite you look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> language as well</font>

612
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:21,380
it's not just about the device but it's

613
00:27:18,849 --> 00:27:23,000
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we're talking about content</font>

614
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:26,150
just happen to have this sheet<font color="#CCCCCC"> of paper</font>

615
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:30,710
with me you know it with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty know</font>

616
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:33,950
in terms of a percentage of content on

617
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:37,810
the internet and English is fifty-five

618
00:27:33,950 --> 00:27:41,720
percent guess what the next language is

619
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:44,690
the next 12 55<font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent eager to</font>

620
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:46,820
stop me yeah you'd think right well what

621
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:49,940
I have here is Russian it's six percent

622
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:51,620
so it doesn't make sense in terms of so

623
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">you what were you going to see it's muy</font>

624
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:55,520
muy muy more English and what does that

625
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">mean in relation to access and the kind</font>

626
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:02,060
of fun and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in you know</font>

627
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:09,560
that you want so I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to ask our</font>

628
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:10,909
chance to talk about I saw thank you so

629
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,169
it was interesting hearing on the

630
00:28:10,910 --> 00:28:14,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">various perspectives the country</font>

631
00:28:12,170 --> 00:28:15,980
perspectives as well of course Chris

632
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,629
that I had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting session just</font>

633
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:19,010
before so it's quite what slightly

634
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:20,300
surprised to hear technicality as well

635
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,390
as you're ready come up in this panel

636
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:24,950
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay internet right or not in terms</font>

637
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:27,050
of what I saw best so I sup there's a

638
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:29,300
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> things around the world in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> terms</font>

639
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:31,159
of you know again just picking<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what</font>

640
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:32,600
I've good some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the things that we've</font>

641
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:35,090
been pushing one is local content

642
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:36,620
vertically lenses other than English or

643
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:39,949
whatever the waste stream language

644
00:28:36,620 --> 00:28:41,989
design and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually been a bit of</font>

645
00:28:39,950 --> 00:28:43,250
a challenge but<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italy in this region in</font>

646
00:28:41,990 --> 00:28:45,980
one particular country where she's from

647
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:49,970
I asked the question in a panel that you

648
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:52,640
know doing me websites etc etc in this

649
00:28:49,970 --> 00:28:54,820
country to be in English Oh in other

650
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:57,920
languages this is about three years ago

651
00:28:54,820 --> 00:29:00,020
and the response from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room more or</font>

652
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,930
less was none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us begin mission which</font>

653
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:05,510
is fine no this isn't daily mind

654
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:07,790
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so in that context and</font>

655
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:09,200
there were a couple of web developers in

656
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,610
the room and I asked them the same

657
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,440
question<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they came back with the</font>

658
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:15,139
same answer because the money is in

659
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,080
English so just as an interesting

660
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:19,970
perspective the other there for a<font color="#CCCCCC"> change</font>

661
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,879
in terms of getting costs down costs of

662
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:25,820
course is always a big big issue one of

663
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,470
the ways that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been pushing from a</font>

664
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:29,600
technical level at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> something my</font>

665
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:35,049
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is doing is looking at</font>

666
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:38,469
neutral IXPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> southeast asian nations in</font>

667
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:40,269
are very very goodly of this problem yes

668
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:41,980
in fact we released one of our papers on

669
00:29:40,269 --> 00:29:44,139
this studying Southeast Asian

670
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:45,429
infrastructure when you see you in

671
00:29:44,139 --> 00:29:48,549
Southeast<font color="#E5E5E5"> Asian particularly is that</font>

672
00:29:45,429 --> 00:29:51,999
there's a laser but it's hardly any

673
00:29:48,549 --> 00:29:54,389
carrier hardly any neutral IXPs we are

674
00:29:51,999 --> 00:29:56,590
lots of my<font color="#CCCCCC"> HPS but they all basically</font>

675
00:29:54,389 --> 00:29:59,469
nails done<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a particular carrier of</font>

676
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,418
particular tempo etc etc the problem

677
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:03,929
with that is it becomes this is my

678
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:06,580
network I'll decide what I do what we do

679
00:30:03,929 --> 00:30:07,869
with the neutral<font color="#CCCCCC"> ixb you know everyone</font>

681
00:30:07,869 --> 00:30:14,590
transparent<font color="#E5E5E5"> way in which that we the</font>

ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> that brings down the cost</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Philippines which is crazy</font>

689
00:30:26,429 --> 00:30:29,769
particular when we start talking about

690
00:30:28,179 --> 00:30:31,679
international transit bus which is very

691
00:30:29,769 --> 00:30:34,119
expensive in some<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of this region</font>

692
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,789
and it's crazy<font color="#E5E5E5"> but this still happens</font>

693
00:30:34,119 --> 00:30:39,100
you know happens here it happens in

00:30:36,789 --> 00:30:41,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">Indonesia happens in Thailand it happens</font>

695
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:42,699
everywhere so these are very basic steps

696
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,379
we could tell you but the problem is you

697
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:46,179
know I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think are typically from the</font>

698
00:30:44,379 --> 00:30:48,369
telecom perspective and just as a

699
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:49,899
disclaimer i come from the telecom

700
00:30:48,369 --> 00:30:53,709
warner used to be I'm a reformed tell

701
00:30:49,899 --> 00:30:55,748

702
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:58,049
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been denied always been protecting</font>

703
00:30:55,749 --> 00:31:01,210
your investments your network you owe

704
00:30:58,049 --> 00:31:03,039
your thing right but business models

705
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:05,769
have evolved and I think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font>

706
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">at how the larger business models</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

707
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:10,840
make things work the telcos the mobile

708
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:12,820
homes etc etc we need to infrastructure

709
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,789
sharing is another one that we really

710
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:17,320
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look hard into and you know</font>

711
00:31:15,789 --> 00:31:19,389
there's been a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> a paradigm shift</font>

712
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:21,039
because of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet another before</font>

713
00:31:19,389 --> 00:31:23,559
technologies and services<font color="#E5E5E5"> that have come</font>

714
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:25,539
about I think it's also high time we had

715
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:27,158
a hard look and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is where</font>

716
00:31:25,539 --> 00:31:29,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">backs government can play a very</font>

717
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:32,710
important role in trying to facilitate

718
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:35,590
foster encourage infrastructure sharing

719
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:37,539
spectrum sharing looking at things like

720
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:41,320
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know for example here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in Southeast</font>

00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:47,440
suppose you can cut this year let's see

724
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,059
how<font color="#CCCCCC"> that goes but one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas can</font>

725
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:52,299
and of course is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's one big free</font>

726
00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:53,559

727
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:55,539
itself is going to have many challenges

728
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:57,279
in this region if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end</font>

729
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:00,220
might one end at singapore the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> end</font>

730
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,019
that's a huge diversity in every

731
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:04,450
category you can take off basically and

732
00:32:02,019 --> 00:32:05,710
then<font color="#CCCCCC"> Philippines Indonesia allow cim</font>

733
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:07,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">odia they're all at different but the</font>

734
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:09,159
three clusters we're headed by where the

735
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,409
issues are in the region in terms of

736
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:12,850
foreign countries stand so there's a lot

737
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:14,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">of work to be done and I think this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

738
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,498
where the role of government i think is

739
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:19,809
very important where they can you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

740
00:32:17,499 --> 00:32:22,990
have the big big big picture look as

741
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:25,059
opposed to having that<font color="#E5E5E5"> old school full</font>

742
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:26,590
of how things used to happen because it

743
00:32:25,059 --> 00:32:28,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">came out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the post and telecom</font>

744
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,039
department which became then comes in

745
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:32,080
calico and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> post office was</font>

746
00:32:30,039 --> 00:32:36,249
stood up from them so there's some very

747
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:38,168
brief or not so brief comments<font color="#E5E5E5"> think i'd</font>

748
00:32:36,249 --> 00:32:40,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">like to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also ask you i understand that</font>

749
00:32:38,169 --> 00:32:43,960
you have done extensive work<font color="#E5E5E5"> also in</font>

750
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:45,820
Africa<font color="#CCCCCC"> but this is more on freedom of</font>

751
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:48,549
expression but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm sure that you've also</font>

752
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:50,080
had a chance to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to them about the</font>

753
00:32:48,549 --> 00:32:52,059
level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of internet access and</font>

754
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:53,980
particularly how this release our

755
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:55,720
freedom of expression and human rights

756
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:58,899
in Africa perhaps you can you share some

757
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:03,249
of those thoughts<font color="#E5E5E5"> with us in Africa me</font>

758
00:32:58,899 --> 00:33:06,758
or in general in general well we think

759
00:33:03,249 --> 00:33:09,119
it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the Internet freedom we</font>

760
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:12,539
think is very important that we

761
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:15,279
reinitiated the freedom online coalition

762
00:33:12,539 --> 00:33:17,470
our country say when we tex I<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

763
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,779
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we did so in our own</font>

764
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:22,809
country was first sighted to make sure

765
00:33:19,779 --> 00:33:24,159
death<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse sense right that you have at</font>

766
00:33:22,809 --> 00:33:26,889
least the infrastructure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

767
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:28,960
many infrastructures open they<font color="#E5E5E5"> grow eyes</font>

768
00:33:26,889 --> 00:33:30,610
please<font color="#CCCCCC"> know the others you need to be at</font>

769
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,529
some instruments through to do that and

770
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> create his level playing field</font>

771
00:33:32,529 --> 00:33:37,179
because that is important but it's also

772
00:33:34,299 --> 00:33:40,509
like maternity and what have you and the

773
00:33:37,179 --> 00:33:42,639
and then of course well we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> our own</font>

774
00:33:40,509 --> 00:33:44,499
committee but also so I we think it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

775
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:46,240
because the<font color="#CCCCCC"> wac mean the interesting</font>

776
00:33:44,499 --> 00:33:49,090
thing of the worldwide back it is

777
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:51,820
worldwide and that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can share say the</font>

778
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:54,158
information so you can have<font color="#E5E5E5"> things in</font>

779
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:55,179
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> country whether the additional</font>

780
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:57,820
value is

781
00:33:55,180 --> 00:34:01,690
is worldwide so you have to you have to

782
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:03,850
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm Kurtz I worldwide feelings I of</font>

783
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:07,180
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to internet so we going to be</font>

784
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:10,960
freedom along coalition and while he

785
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:13,810
thinks I is access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to internet so I is</font>

786
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,330
imported freedom and<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet governance</font>

787
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:19,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">then that's right what comes from Islam</font>

788
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:21,040
that comes to that you make you know

789
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,920
agreements with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other cover you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

790
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:31,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">night you to keep this limited with</font>

791
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:34,570
these freedoms on internet we I mean do

792
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:36,850
so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in favor of limitations one</font>

793
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:42,390
of the things also we initiate right now

794
00:34:36,850 --> 00:34:46,060
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure that what we have say</font>

795
00:34:42,389 --> 00:34:48,879
normally when we have expert both goods

796
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:54,270
which can be made which you can can be

797
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:57,550
used for bad things like well thank next

798
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:59,950
frigates and what have you they have to

799
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:02,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">have an export license from us now what</font>

800
00:34:59,950 --> 00:35:05,200
we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do as well it's also a</font>

801
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:09,549
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> part to to encourage other</font>

802
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:12,220
countries to look into technologies that

803
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:14,380
can prevent people from access to

804
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,379
internet or surveillance technology and

805
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:19,240
we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should you should also have</font>

806
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:21,730
a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at that especially so because</font>

807
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:24,310
sometimes especially when it can be dual

808
00:35:21,730 --> 00:35:26,290
use goods as we as we see<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know it</font>

809
00:35:24,310 --> 00:35:28,650
can be equally good<font color="#CCCCCC"> mechanical bad but</font>

810
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:32,259
make sure where you export those

811
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:34,720
technologies to and we think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

812
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:39,940
contribute to you know at least prevents

813
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,009
an easy hindrance to the internet or

814
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:46,990
worldwide surveillance of the internet

815
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:49,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">which cannot be in favor of course so um</font>

816
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:52,359
we've talked about your experiences in

817
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:54,460
terms of on the state of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet in</font>

818
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:58,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">your respective</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> countries and how you</font>

819
00:35:54,460 --> 00:36:01,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">have undertaken projects to improve the</font>

820
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:04,660
level of access um<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd also like to ask</font>

821
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:06,330
you um for instance we do you are you

822
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:09,450
talked about improving

823
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:11,370
since it by providing wireless access<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

824
00:36:09,450 --> 00:36:15,149
the communities we see that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

825
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:18,350
difference between the need for access

828
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">all we are talking about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the violence or</font>

two ways that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cut the content should</font>

be come from the bottom up approach and

835
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,920
the carnet should be given by the

836
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:53,279
committee's instead of what we are

the internet or they want the access for

the same meal there we cannot

00:38:00,089 --> 00:38:06,220
marginalize them to me little power then

866
00:38:03,999 --> 00:38:10,868
they're already in power just<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is</font>

don't understand to search the search

870
00:38:16,869 --> 00:38:21,339
the internet so dance the content which

<font color="#CCCCCC">means with a good by the focus of</font>

we have no wireless for committee

881
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:51,009
like to ask<font color="#E5E5E5"> Chris recording your project</font>

with orange<font color="#CCCCCC"> cellco um based on the your</font>

883
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:56,019
presentation earlier I would understand

884
00:38:54,009 --> 00:39:00,039
that this would only work because<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

885
00:38:56,019 --> 00:39:02,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">quantity 16 so um how how are you able</font>

886
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:06,029
to make this<font color="#CCCCCC"> work for rural areas where</font>

887
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:09,098
the population is um not that much and

888
00:39:06,029 --> 00:39:14,170
is there<font color="#CCCCCC"> any plaintiff limited in the</font>

889
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:16,289
last month so that's that's a couple of

890
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:19,450
a question in one I mean I feel<font color="#CCCCCC"> like the</font>

891
00:39:16,289 --> 00:39:21,700
the the way that we have structured what

892
00:39:19,450 --> 00:39:22,960
we're doing with orange it's everywhere

893
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:25,769
it's for everywhere in the country but

894
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're right there's a question whether</font>

895
00:39:25,769 --> 00:39:30,609
after the six month period expires how

896
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:33,039
many of those users will sign<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and</font>

897
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:34,569
have it as economies work out come and

898
00:39:33,039 --> 00:39:36,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's mostly what our carrier</font>

899
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:38,200
partners would deal with me<font color="#E5E5E5"> at Mozilla</font>

900
00:39:36,309 --> 00:39:40,869
wouldn't get involved in that not

901
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:43,299
particularly but there is no theoretical

902
00:39:40,869 --> 00:39:47,049
question there of how to deal with with

903
00:39:43,299 --> 00:39:50,710
rural areas where it's it's trickier<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

904
00:39:47,049 --> 00:39:52,359
mean the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the spectrum works differently</font>

905
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,980
in different ways and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so in rural areas</font>

906
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:56,619
you can use much lower frequency

907
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:58,269
spectrum that has much greater distance

908
00:39:56,619 --> 00:40:02,049
that it carries and so you can have

909
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:04,598
fewer cell sites that are cheaper to

910
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:05,799
maintain then the multiplicity of sites

911
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:08,619
that you would need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to maintain in an</font>

912
00:40:05,799 --> 00:40:10,390
urban area so there are ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> to deal</font>

913
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:12,369
with this but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a very difficult</font>

914
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:14,950
problem and and sometimes<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean it</font>

915
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,799
historically the United States the way

916
00:40:14,950 --> 00:40:19,419
that we have dealt with<font color="#E5E5E5"> that is is</font>

917
00:40:16,799 --> 00:40:20,859
effectively through subsidization the

918
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,319
Federal Communications Commission takes

919
00:40:20,859 --> 00:40:25,808
in universal service fees and implements

920
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:27,430
a federal policy of universal service in

921
00:40:25,809 --> 00:40:29,349
order to subsidize the more expensive

922
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:31,029
connections to the more rural areas<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

923
00:40:29,349 --> 00:40:32,859
the country name that's a framework that

924
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:34,930
we needed to develop in order to try to

925
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:36,460
achieve the vision of universal service

926
00:40:34,930 --> 00:40:38,109
and it's tricky and there's a major

927
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:42,059
government role in it in many different

928
00:40:38,109 --> 00:40:45,098
countries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will need to be ultimately</font>

929
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:46,839
you mentioned subsidization so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd also</font>

930
00:40:45,099 --> 00:40:48,000
like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that except and it is what do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

931
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:50,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">think of</font>

932
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,769
interplay between state action to

933
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:58,960
improve internet access versus community

934
00:40:53,769 --> 00:41:01,180
action to improve internet access<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

935
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's a yep that's very interesting a</font>

936
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,629
very interesting question about the

937
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:06,759
subsidizes because we have a very

938
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:08,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">different experience in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Indonesia the</font>

939
00:41:06,759 --> 00:41:12,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">government s collect the universal</font>

940
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:14,319
service obligation whatever does with

941
00:41:12,309 --> 00:41:19,029
the money whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want right in</font>

942
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:23,470
Pakistan right so but what's happening

943
00:41:19,029 --> 00:41:26,170
here in our country is we just got sick

944
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:29,109
of that inside and we started building

945
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:35,529
our own I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> really building our own</font>

946
00:41:29,109 --> 00:41:39,069
and they simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> stopped it just because</font>

947
00:41:35,529 --> 00:41:40,809
it isn't in the government's program so

948
00:41:39,069 --> 00:41:44,410
everything that isn't a government

949
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:48,130
program does not exist which comes to<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

950
00:41:44,410 --> 00:41:49,899
answer what you told<font color="#CCCCCC"> me the traffic</font>

951
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:51,279
going outside there's a few pictures

952
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:54,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">here I don't know if I'm going to show</font>

953
00:41:51,279 --> 00:41:58,890
it there but the Allegiant traffic has

954
00:41:54,279 --> 00:42:01,450
never gone through the US since 2001

955
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:03,670
right but it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a government project</font>

956
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:09,129
and the government doesn't recognize it

957
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:10,990
hence it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> exist so that's kind of</font>

958
00:42:09,130 --> 00:42:13,000
true practice I'm yes technically yeah

959
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:14,859
if it<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't your government run it</font>

960
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,509
doesn't either so the subsidized we

961
00:42:14,859 --> 00:42:19,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't need there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even this one case</font>

962
00:42:16,509 --> 00:42:21,279
first media had this brilliant<font color="#E5E5E5"> I here</font>

963
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:23,740
creating<font color="#CCCCCC"> a project ten dollars per month</font>

964
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:25,180
unlimited internet access goes to the

965
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:29,979
house of<font color="#CCCCCC"> parliament they declined it</font>

966
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:32,049
because it was sooo cheap so the private

967
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,819
sector actually has the money has the

968
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:38,799
technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> has the willingness to do</font>

969
00:42:33,819 --> 00:42:43,450
that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> simply is not allowed that's the</font>

970
00:42:38,799 --> 00:42:51,190
case in my country and<font color="#E5E5E5"> leases and so</font>

971
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:53,399
yeah here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're on a show all</font>

972
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:53,400
right

973
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:03,890
yeah if i can add something while this

974
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:07,910
is being connected we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> had some</font>

975
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:10,339
similar situations and pants on with

976
00:43:07,910 --> 00:43:11,990
telcos offering really good SMS<font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font>

977
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bull's them are free but they're almost</font>

978
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:16,640
free and then there was a plantation in

979
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:19,910
the code saying that by offering free

980
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:22,279
SMS bundles the moral values of the

981
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:25,129
society are being affected because there

982
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,020
are too many young people messaging

983
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:28,850
carrying on love affair than what not

984
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,650
and then there was a directive by the

985
00:43:28,850 --> 00:43:32,839
government to stop offering those

986
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:35,450
bangles specifically those that were

987
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:40,250
like nighttime<font color="#E5E5E5"> panels you know 12 a.m.</font>

988
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:42,109
to 12pm unlimited SMS so it's

989
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:44,360
interesting to see how you know these

990
00:43:42,110 --> 00:43:46,280
things are offered by<font color="#CCCCCC"> the corporate</font>

internet everyone has a say on the

1061
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:07,660
internet and that's what the open<font color="#CCCCCC"> ID is</font>

1062

00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:08,350
telcos here would like us to believe

1077

exchange point and then liquid they were

1094
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:54,580
quite after that so just that just

1095
00:48:50,140 --> 00:48:57,970
actually shows how when when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop</font>

like this why you know internet services

1100
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,600
expensive why is it that we only have

1101
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:13,210
less than<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty percent of the</font>

00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:18,400
they'll just keep<font color="#CCCCCC"> telling us all the</font>

enough to get the telcos to connect to a

technically connected it's just

1144
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:32,130
everybody would go be a Hong Kong yes I

1145
00:51:24,870 --> 00:51:33,930
get to eat<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff so more like much much</font>

1146
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:37,290
ever present it's a big traffic now is

1147
00:51:33,930 --> 00:51:39,200
actually 180 gigs alright so back in two

1148
00:51:37,290 --> 00:51:41,970
thousand one<font color="#CCCCCC"> man going to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> US was</font>

1149
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:44,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">88,000 US dollars per month so divide</font>

1150
00:51:41,970 --> 00:51:46,399
multiply benefits now one thing why<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1151
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:49,288
was invited to what she

1152
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,390
which means this Akamai study said in

1153
00:51:49,289 --> 00:51:54,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the medium has risen in terms of quality</font>

1154
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:57,390
forty-four percent last year and my

1155
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:59,459
answer was they were wrong I mean it's

1156
00:51:57,390 --> 00:52:02,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">always been like this the problem is</font>

1157
00:51:59,459 --> 00:52:04,379
atomized algorithm always calculated how

1158
00:52:02,279 --> 00:52:06,209
much how fast the traffic is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

1159
00:52:04,380 --> 00:52:10,049
through their<font color="#CCCCCC"> CD ends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> which goes outside</font>

1160
00:52:06,209 --> 00:52:13,948
but is a hundred of 80 gigs of data that

1161
00:52:10,049 --> 00:52:15,869
a cell phone user Indonesia connects to

1162
00:52:13,949 --> 00:52:17,999
a local content provider in amnesia

1163
00:52:15,869 --> 00:52:21,989
going through the overnight see is never

1164
00:52:17,999 --> 00:52:23,640
calculated by Akamai so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they've</font>

1165
00:52:21,989 --> 00:52:26,400
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something wrong</font>

1166
00:52:23,640 --> 00:52:29,959
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only reason</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the only way late in</font>

1167
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:29,959
the correct app is telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> everyone</font>

1168
00:53:20,789 --> 00:53:28,359
you're probably run from me run sorry I

1169
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:29,859
can try any problem for problem my kind

1170
00:53:28,359 --> 00:53:31,150
of experience remember I<font color="#CCCCCC"> told you will</font>

1171
00:53:29,859 --> 00:53:33,058
not under the government and everything

1172
00:53:31,150 --> 00:53:36,549
so that's that's the way we protect our

1173
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:39,099
human rights the government has no case

1174
00:53:36,549 --> 00:53:42,460
and no power to see what passes through

1175
00:53:39,099 --> 00:53:45,009
the local exchange so that's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power</font>

1176
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:46,420
that we have I know for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a fact that both</font>

1177
00:53:45,009 --> 00:53:48,250
of the government's<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I know in this</font>

1178
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:50,170
region always says we need to protect

1179
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:54,480
the internet pornography night they put

1180
00:53:50,170 --> 00:53:56,289
these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices to wheel</font>

1181
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:58,299
pornography but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not a single</font>

1182
00:53:56,289 --> 00:54:00,730
country that I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that power</font>

1183
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:04,380
of filtering pornography that has never

1184
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:09,940
used it to block their political rivals

1185
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:13,269
so yes do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that but the control has still</font>

1186
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:15,130
to be with the people if there's

1187
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:16,709
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on and run there's no</font>

1188
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:21,579
way the government should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font>

1189
00:54:16,710 --> 00:54:24,130
switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> off your internet the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> another</font>

1190
00:54:21,579 --> 00:54:26,920
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is to go sleep it is still</font>

1191
00:54:24,130 --> 00:54:28,839
connected to the internet to the World

1192
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:31,839
Wide Web it's not site completely

1193
00:54:28,839 --> 00:54:34,359
isolated<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah that is the other thing as</font>

1194
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,230
well I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you said as well if they</font>

1195
00:54:34,359 --> 00:54:39,640
if they so I emailed them then

1196
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:42,759
everybody's still connected for they

1197
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:45,069
have to freeway let me just add sort of

1198
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:47,680
a 3rd regional reference or comparison

1199
00:54:45,069 --> 00:54:49,480
point here and that's Europe so in

1200
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,129
Europe there are a lot of conversations

1201
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:54,579
now about the concept of a European

1202
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:57,339
cloud so we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got only talked to two</font>

1203
00:54:54,579 --> 00:54:58,990
people in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Commission and Parliament</font>

1204
00:54:57,339 --> 00:55:00,970
about this and our point of view is

1205
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,919
always you want to build a cloud

1206
00:55:00,970 --> 00:55:06,250
infrastructure in the new Europe great

1207
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:08,500
please do you want to mandate that all

1208
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:10,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">European citizen data be stored in the</font>

1209
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:13,059
air pink<font color="#E5E5E5"> cloud and not in non-european</font>

1210
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:16,059
clouds that breaks the global open<font color="#E5E5E5"> web</font>

1211
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:18,819
so it's really about whether you are

1212
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:22,289
additive to the network or whether you

1213
00:55:18,819 --> 00:55:22,288
are closing it in what you're doing

1214
00:55:31,099 --> 00:55:37,859
I'm with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Allison's and so we</font>

1215
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:40,619
struggle a lot with the kill switch<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1216
00:55:37,859 --> 00:55:44,670
network this connectivity is on<font color="#CCCCCC"> any</font>

1217
00:55:40,619 --> 00:55:46,890
protector of security of course like I

1218
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:49,230
recently just yesterday we had the box

1219
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:50,790
and a parade and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mobile networks in</font>

1220
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Sabah have been switched off for the</font>

1221
00:55:50,790 --> 00:55:56,130
whole week for extended three hours so

1222
00:55:54,030 --> 00:55:58,290
it was two hours a<font color="#E5E5E5"> week five and three</font>

1223
00:55:56,130 --> 00:56:01,770
hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> and six hours and it's not</font>

1224
00:55:58,290 --> 00:56:04,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that it's not a unique</font>

1225
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:06,420
happening it happens usually at times

1226
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,369
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are most vulnerable and then</font>

1227
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:11,579
they're suddenly without mobile and

1228
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:14,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet and we have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1229
00:56:11,579 --> 00:56:16,170
research thinking that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay this has to</font>

1230
00:56:14,099 --> 00:56:18,599
be the worst thing happening ever and

1231
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:20,849
then found<font color="#CCCCCC"> power happens in other</font>

1232
00:56:18,599 --> 00:56:23,160
countries essa so for people who are

1233
00:56:20,849 --> 00:56:26,160
sitting on a panel like I she will be

1234
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:28,529
have you experienced this in different

1235
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">countries and then how do you go about</font>

1236
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,240
actually dealing with a pending

1237
00:56:30,210 --> 00:56:36,599
government comes up with a legit reasons

1238
00:56:33,240 --> 00:56:40,470
for you know shutting it down saying<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh</font>

1239
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:42,480
mobile to<font color="#E5E5E5"> bomb trigger and would you</font>

1240
00:56:40,470 --> 00:56:49,078
rather die or be without decimals for a

1241
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:51,329
few hours right that actually happened

1242
00:56:49,079 --> 00:56:56,660
recently in Manila because the Pope was

1243
00:56:51,329 --> 00:57:00,630
here so all of a sudden all mobile

1244
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:03,569
subscribers lost<font color="#E5E5E5"> connection basically</font>

1245
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:07,380
lost signal and we thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was just a</font>

1246
00:57:03,569 --> 00:57:10,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">downtime but no it was revealed while it</font>

1247
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:13,290
was happening and we received an SMS

1248
00:57:10,109 --> 00:57:16,020
said look it was the government it was

1249
00:57:13,290 --> 00:57:18,230
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> order by the government for cellular</font>

1250
00:57:16,020 --> 00:57:21,900
all cellular companies to shut down

1251
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:26,400
basically shut down mobile services

1252
00:57:21,900 --> 00:57:30,300
because to protect the Pope so I there

1253
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:34,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">was a mix there's sorry yeah it was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

1254
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:38,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">oh god yes and we are eighty-three</font>

1255
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,240
percent cackling so we all complied so

1256
00:57:40,460 --> 00:57:46,380
so that said this is very relevant and

1257
00:57:44,760 --> 00:57:48,660
interesting question I actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1258
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:50,250
know how to answer it because for me we

1259
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:53,879
calculate I<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to protect the Pope</font>

1260
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:56,580
of course but but at what expense and

1261
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,410
why are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we not informed because everyone</font>

1262
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:59,940
was saying of course you were informed

1263
00:57:58,410 --> 00:58:02,250
because then you would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font>

1264
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:04,080
informed the earth whoever wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1265
00:58:02,250 --> 00:58:07,710
something bad to the poem<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay that</font>

1266
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:12,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">makes sense so but so what how about the</font>

1267
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:18,660
at what cause we are we willing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put</font>

1268
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:22,980
tech you know citizens and why why is it

1269
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:24,870
that why is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the telcos get it is</font>

1270
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:28,620
easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut about their you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1271
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:30,839
services but when it's in terms of the

1272
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:33,839
clamor of people to make your services

1273
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:36,060
better than we going to anything about

1274
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:39,510
it so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a very tricky</font>

1275
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:41,490
question so I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to add</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

1276
00:58:39,510 --> 00:58:43,140
reference point this didn't it happens

1277
00:58:41,490 --> 00:58:45,509
in many many places all around the world

1278
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:48,120
it happen in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oakland California about</font>

1279
00:58:45,510 --> 00:58:50,910
three years ago there<font color="#E5E5E5"> were part protests</font>

1280
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,410
going on just normal normal minor

1281
00:58:50,910 --> 00:58:54,270
protests about public transportation

1282
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:57,290
systems and the Oakland Police

1283
00:58:54,270 --> 00:58:59,910
Department put pressure on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local</font>

1284
00:58:57,290 --> 00:59:02,130
cellular network operator to temporarily

1285
00:58:59,910 --> 00:59:04,259
shut down and cellular network to make

1286
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:06,210
it harder for people to coordinate and

1287
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:07,800
to protest it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculous incident</font>

1288
00:59:06,210 --> 00:59:10,200
there was a lot of public pressure in

1289
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:12,360
the u.s. against that but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I did I</font>

1290
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,919
can give you a framework of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what what I</font>

1291
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:16,440
believe the answer to be to this which

1292
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:18,720
is democratic processes that develop

1293
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,730
rules and processes that governments

1294
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,529
must go through in order to decide

1295
00:59:20,730 --> 00:59:24,360
whether to do something<font color="#CCCCCC"> like this and</font>

1296
00:59:22,530 --> 00:59:26,220
then the most important part in the park

1297
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:28,890
that almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> ever exists in practice is</font>

1298
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:31,500
accountability after the fact so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

1299
00:59:28,890 --> 00:59:33,060
they didn't follow their own rules they

1300
00:59:31,500 --> 00:59:37,920
need to be held accountable and no one

1301
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:41,580
should<font color="#E5E5E5"> be above</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the law</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also in I was</font>

1302
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:44,460
until a frico in March and I know last

1303
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:47,370
month and it did happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because</font>

1304
00:59:44,460 --> 00:59:51,160
though but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's actually security that</font>

1305
00:59:47,370 --> 00:59:56,920
it was there was a protest against

1306
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:59,410
then again<font color="#CCCCCC"> three NC and there was it was</font>

1307
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:03,150
being covered inside the Parliament in

1308
00:59:59,410 --> 01:00:09,670
the signals went<font color="#CCCCCC"> off completely and also</font>

1309
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:12,400
the slogan was in protest of media wants

1310
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:13,690
to bring back the signal the brain but

1311
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,600
because that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> why they teach your daily</font>

1312
01:00:13,690 --> 01:00:19,260
sort of kill that at that point<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said I</font>

1313
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:23,080
guess it's for different reasons<font color="#CCCCCC"> ringing</font>

1314
01:00:19,260 --> 01:00:27,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right so because this is a human</font>

1315
01:00:23,080 --> 01:00:28,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">rights thing you know so what happened</font>

1316
01:00:27,400 --> 01:00:32,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the media is this is very interesting</font>

1317
01:00:28,930 --> 01:00:35,710
we have ehh i told you so practically

1318
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:41,290
logically after<font color="#CCCCCC"> 911 everyone came over</font>

1319
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:42,550
to gauge as i mentioned i don't really

1320
01:00:41,290 --> 01:00:45,040
like working with the governor I don't

1321
01:00:42,550 --> 01:00:47,920
play well<font color="#CCCCCC"> with others is the river so</font>

1322
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,050
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> civilly disobedient so they came up</font>

1323
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:52,240
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay there are people are dying now</font>

1324
01:00:50,050 --> 01:00:54,010
you have to let<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in we have to see all</font>

1325
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:56,259
the traffic that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> fighting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thru da</font>

1326
01:00:54,010 --> 01:00:58,840
change so we can get the bad guys and

1327
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,400
one thing is logical<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's choose but</font>

1328
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:02,950
second thing is now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't really feel</font>

1329
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">comfortable with it so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thought in two</font>

1330
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:09,160
thousand even<font color="#E5E5E5"> our peak traffic was 30</font>

1331
01:01:06,310 --> 01:01:11,710
years ago three<font color="#CCCCCC"> days</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or something 1111</font>

1332
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:14,799
Giga right so they came<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this device</font>

1333
01:01:11,710 --> 01:01:18,160
which was a hundred base they couldn't

1334
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:20,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">get the traffic of one game so I said</font>

1335
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:25,180
yeah please come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back I'll pass all the</font>

1336
01:01:20,620 --> 01:01:26,740
traffic to you to your 100 Meg link now

1337
01:01:25,180 --> 01:01:29,500
the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> year they came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up with a one</font>

1338
01:01:26,740 --> 01:01:34,020
gig device trying to get all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the traffic</font>

1339
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:36,490
and our traffic was 30 gigs right so now

1340
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:41,370
technically a cisco router you can only

1341
01:01:36,490 --> 01:01:43,569
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> port mirroring to a physical</font>

1342
01:01:41,370 --> 01:01:45,460
interface so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> biggest physical</font>

1343
01:01:43,570 --> 01:01:46,840
interface now is a 10 game so now

1344
01:01:45,460 --> 01:01:50,920
they've come up with a ton great device

1345
01:01:46,840 --> 01:01:54,460
and my traffic is 180 gigs right so we

1346
01:01:50,920 --> 01:01:58,830
left them we'd let them see the traffic

1347
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:59,980
we just made more and more traffic to

1348
01:01:58,830 --> 01:02:02,670
confuse

1349
01:01:59,980 --> 01:02:07,540
them they couldn't see anything you know

1350
01:02:02,670 --> 01:02:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">attend big traffic on a 180 cake peak so</font>

1351
01:02:07,540 --> 01:02:13,950
yes I am abiding what the government or

1352
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:17,259
weak intelligence community is asking me

1353
01:02:13,950 --> 01:02:21,180
but I'm trying not<font color="#CCCCCC"> to let them see</font>

1354
01:02:17,260 --> 01:02:27,760
anyway so yeah you can try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do that</font>

1355
01:02:21,180 --> 01:02:29,440
maybe yeah any more questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I</font>

1356
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:32,590
think we've already come full circle

1357
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:35,290
from the problem of access to be having

1358
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:40,450
access I didn't having it taken away<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1359
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:42,750
I I like to ask our speakers if make

1360
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:46,629
some recommendations that they think

1361
01:02:42,750 --> 01:02:48,070
others could take all in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1362
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:54,580
improve<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet access on the</font>

1363
01:02:48,070 --> 01:02:56,410
respective countries I thinks I wanna me

1364
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:58,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">wonder would you vote for would say all</font>

1365
01:02:56,410 --> 01:03:01,060
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem things are being this close</font>

1366
01:02:58,060 --> 01:03:02,950
to make juice<font color="#E5E5E5"> in as well please say the</font>

1367
01:03:01,060 --> 01:03:04,869
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of course seems like a whole</font>

1368
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:07,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">different world</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in a sense it is</font>

1369
01:03:04,869 --> 01:03:09,850
when it comes to you know to human life

1370
01:03:07,210 --> 01:03:12,520
justice it's not and so the

1371
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:14,950
accountability you have say in your real

1372
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:16,869
actions you also have on the internet

1373
01:03:14,950 --> 01:03:19,000
and should be there on the internet that

1374
01:03:16,869 --> 01:03:21,880
suddenly there are different rules then

1375
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:23,470
on say that an online<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the same rule</font>

1376
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:27,180
smart and it's also comes from

1377
01:03:23,470 --> 01:03:27,180
government program notes and<font color="#CCCCCC"> a day</font>

1378
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:36,619
so the the take home that I or the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1379
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:38,810
point that I would<font color="#E5E5E5"> deliver here is it's</font>

1380
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:40,550
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just about not only is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it not just</font>

1381
01:03:38,810 --> 01:03:42,110
about connecting to facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would</font>

1382
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:43,280
argue it's not just about connecting to

1383
01:03:42,110 --> 01:03:45,080
the internet it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1384
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,060
connecting to the web and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the reason I</font>

1385
01:03:45,080 --> 01:03:48,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">make that distinction is that it's not</font>

1386
01:03:47,060 --> 01:03:51,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">just about connecting it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1387
01:03:48,920 --> 01:03:53,480
about putting content in front of people

1388
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:55,430
so that they can consume it it's really

1389
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">a very important part of this that I</font>

1390
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:59,540
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we never lose is</font>

1391
01:03:56,990 --> 01:04:01,609
that the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet is us it's made of</font>

1392
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:03,770
cost it's built by us and the things

1393
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:06,080
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do and that we create and</font>

1394
01:04:03,770 --> 01:04:08,990
contribute to it and that's a really

1395
01:04:06,080 --> 01:04:13,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">important part of this ecosystem and of</font>

1396
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:16,339
how we build and support access and why

1397
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:18,500
so you know just sort of leading on from

1398
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:19,910
that what I would say is that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1399
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,910
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't mention is to go anyway Chris</font>

1400
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:24,740
that you know when someone goes on like

1401
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:26,200
the new billions for example billion

1402
01:04:24,740 --> 01:04:30,080
billions depending on how you look at it

1403
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:32,060
they go in<font color="#E5E5E5"> s</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> condemn canoes but really I</font>

1404
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:33,619
think we kept it low but keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1405
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,500
that they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be content creators</font>

1406
01:04:33,619 --> 01:04:38,300
and we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> provide them with an</font>

1407
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:40,369
environment that will that bet Forge

1408
01:04:38,300 --> 01:04:42,080
which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think we do very well in</font>

1409
01:04:40,369 --> 01:04:44,270
some places to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do something I think it's</font>

1410
01:04:42,080 --> 01:04:46,220
more known and yes on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so that could</font>

1411
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:49,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">be good the kill switch is a really bad</font>

1412
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:50,959
idea oh I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> when examples</font>

1413
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:53,029
already yeah killed it'll switch because

1414
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:56,240
you know putting in the surveillance

1415
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:58,670
device is great on the law enforcement

1416
01:04:56,240 --> 01:05:01,040
perspective but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem is depending</font>

1417
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:02,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">on who's in power when what the device</font>

1418
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,790
will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be used for we have no control over</font>

1419
01:05:02,510 --> 01:05:06,680
so that's why jahar so it was quite

1420
01:05:04,790 --> 01:05:08,869
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure give you the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kennedy</font>

1421
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:10,640
come with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> hundred next year but come</font>

1422
01:05:08,869 --> 01:05:16,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">up to you you know what kind of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1423
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:19,609
only now so good luck for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that and you</font>

1424
01:05:16,160 --> 01:05:22,129
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally the internet and I think</font>

1425
01:05:19,609 --> 01:05:24,619
will potentially agree 3d transform

1426
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:27,410
lives and people over the last<font color="#E5E5E5"> two</font>

1427
01:05:24,619 --> 01:05:31,340
decades that it's become mainstream but

1428
01:05:27,410 --> 01:05:32,600
this still a whole lot to come here this

1429
01:05:31,340 --> 01:05:34,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just a preview that's the way I look</font>

1430
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,130
at you know the mailing it shows it is

1431
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:39,319
about to begin so whatever actions we do

1432
01:05:37,130 --> 01:05:41,570
individually collectively be from the

1433
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,980
policy side be from regulatory side<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead</font>

1434
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:45,140
from private sector

1435
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:47,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">society activism said we need to ensure</font>

1436
01:05:45,140 --> 01:05:48,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you know we don't put a damper on</font>

1437
01:05:47,210 --> 01:05:51,590
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet it needs to continue</font>

1438
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:53,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">growing evolving and basically having a</font>

1439
01:05:51,590 --> 01:05:55,760
life of its own because that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1440
01:05:53,390 --> 01:06:01,609
had to did and it's big pretty it's been

1441
01:05:55,760 --> 01:06:04,670
a pretty good<font color="#E5E5E5"> damage over coming</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

1442
01:06:01,609 --> 01:06:06,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes actually we were taught any</font>

1443
01:06:04,670 --> 01:06:07,820
media that means that belongs to

1444
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:10,009
everyone and we built into<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in the</font>

1445
01:06:07,820 --> 01:06:13,130
early 90s Cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> tales and a handstand</font>

1446
01:06:10,010 --> 01:06:14,930
together to have every access so now we

1447
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:16,280
come in part by coming to a study

1448
01:06:14,930 --> 01:06:18,200
committee can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> build internet</font>

1449
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:21,200
and we successfully done that is the

1450
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:23,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">group</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> indonesia so my only suggestion is</font>

1451
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:26,450
for the big corporates like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and</font>

1452
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:29,030
everyone else know to build<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet</font>

1453
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:32,029
the government isn't the only one you're

1454
01:06:29,030 --> 01:06:34,070
supposed to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to or you're not only</font>

1455
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,920
supposed to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the big corporates</font>

1456
01:06:34,070 --> 01:06:39,619
which is what is happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in this</font>

1457
01:06:36,920 --> 01:06:42,109
region so they kind of forgot what they

1458
01:06:39,619 --> 01:06:50,210
taught us in the 90s so we're here<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1459
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:55,369
remind you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to empowerment rather than</font>

1460
01:06:50,210 --> 01:06:57,050
just access and what we're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> good I</font>

1461
01:06:55,369 --> 01:07:00,650
don't know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a suggestion</font>

1462
01:06:57,050 --> 01:07:02,780
it's an experiment that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> box</font>

1463
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:05,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">on and it's like small movements</font>

1464
01:07:02,780 --> 01:07:06,770
starting around since all do is on

1465
01:07:05,180 --> 01:07:08,240
national language and the script is very

1466
01:07:06,770 --> 01:07:11,509
different from English and we're still

1467
01:07:08,240 --> 01:07:13,729
struggling with font compatibility so

1468
01:07:11,510 --> 01:07:16,220
for<font color="#CCCCCC"> now their thoughts about kind of</font>

1469
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:17,869
standardizing the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roman or do and Roman</font>

1470
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,459
or do is like when you use English

1471
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:21,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">alphabets to thai food and there is no</font>

1472
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:23,600
standardization obviously you can't

1473
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:26,960
ready salad so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know it's a good</font>

1474
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:28,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing or a bad thing but I constantly</font>

1475
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,260
hearing talks from really different

1476
01:07:28,609 --> 01:07:32,060
groups Alec oh there's romance in the

1477
01:07:30,260 --> 01:07:35,119
anti-roman Punjabi and there's Roman

1478
01:07:32,060 --> 01:07:37,009
home to<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ari and I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not really</font>

1479
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,340
comfortable with this but I like the

1480
01:07:37,010 --> 01:07:42,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea that people are experimenting we</font>

1481
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,290
are also exploiting some of the

1482
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:47,119
loopholes and we just got a funding for

1483
01:07:45,290 --> 01:07:48,500
putting up a mesh network we don't have

1484
01:07:47,119 --> 01:07:51,140
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Commission for but then there's</font>

1485
01:07:48,500 --> 01:07:52,790
nothing borrowing us so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> technically</font>

1486
01:07:51,140 --> 01:07:56,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">not legal but technically it's not</font>

1487
01:07:52,790 --> 01:07:57,950
illegal either we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know where</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to go</font>

1488
01:07:56,030 --> 01:08:00,740
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's time that we start</font>

1489
01:07:57,950 --> 01:08:02,689
pushing some boundaries and<font color="#E5E5E5"> making the</font>

1490
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:05,600
government see that<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are not</font>

1491
01:08:02,690 --> 01:08:08,060
being proactive civil society other

1492
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:09,680
actors are going to step in and you just

1493
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,930
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into this debate now you</font>

1494
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:14,029
need to start getting serious about it

1495
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:16,880
otherwise think you might happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1496
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:19,339
you are<font color="#E5E5E5"> not really comfortable with so</font>

1497
01:08:16,880 --> 01:08:21,740
kind of forcing both goals and through

1498
01:08:19,339 --> 01:08:25,818
solving initiatives that are technically

1499
01:08:21,740 --> 01:08:27,679
not illegal but without comments that

1500
01:08:25,819 --> 01:08:29,420
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the way to get the</font>

1501
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:35,120
engagement that we have been getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

1502
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:37,549
far for like in India what we have been

1503
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:39,858
doing is it later providing the access

1504
01:08:37,549 --> 01:08:42,109
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> implementation side we believe</font>

1505
01:08:39,859 --> 01:08:44,900
that key information access to

1506
01:08:42,109 --> 01:08:48,230
information is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> major source to make</font>

1507
01:08:44,899 --> 01:08:50,469
that empower everyone so so that's how

1508
01:08:48,229 --> 01:08:52,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">all which we are doing here so is not</font>

1509
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:54,740
connecting is my third solution is that

1510
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:57,290
what kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information they want to</font>

1511
01:08:54,740 --> 01:09:02,719
receive it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also that we see it as a</font>

1512
01:08:57,290 --> 01:09:05,569
solution and apart from that click what

1513
01:09:02,720 --> 01:09:07,520
we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> be seen</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that there India is a</font>

1514
01:09:05,569 --> 01:09:09,770
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things in our digital India</font>

1515
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:12,350
mission and there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of campaigns</font>

1516
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:14,450
from the government side on the contrary

1517
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:17,480
side there have been a blockages there

1518
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:18,889
are happier it the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dissenter 32 website</font>

1519
01:09:17,479 --> 01:09:22,910
have me blocked by the government

1520
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:25,790
including the websites which happy just

1521
01:09:22,910 --> 01:09:29,029
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a bean your website from a poem by</font>

1522
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:31,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">YouTube was drawn by it and then the fls</font>

1523
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:35,029
blockages and is happening also in hot

1524
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:37,069
legs so looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the perspective from</font>

1525
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:40,130
the side of her key<font color="#E5E5E5"> India is providing</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">is a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free space everything's free but</font>

1527
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">all the other side there is a blockage</font>

1528
01:09:42,710 --> 01:09:46,580
and the content of this on the side so

1529
01:09:44,779 --> 01:09:48,469
telling them about being an

1530
01:09:46,580 --> 01:09:50,330
evidence-based approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> halim sell that</font>

1531
01:09:48,470 --> 01:09:52,100
TV to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the model there are you see models</font>

1532
01:09:50,330 --> 01:09:55,070
and these are the models which we can

1533
01:09:52,100 --> 01:09:56,960
bring it up into the something and from

1534
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:58,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">the for government if you cannot do the</font>

01:09:56,960 --> 01:10:00,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">same we are ready to doing it we are</font>

1536
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,360
already doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> it if you cannot adopt</font>

1537
01:10:00,680 --> 01:10:05,150
this model we are already doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1538
01:10:02,360 --> 01:10:07,589
morning so what's the city then they

1539
01:10:05,150 --> 01:10:14,719
might come and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if I coaches</font>

1540
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:17,310
I just want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say two things first I</font>

1541
01:10:14,719 --> 01:10:19,409
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> God we should stop saying that</font>

1542
01:10:17,310 --> 01:10:21,989
internet is a human right if you don't

1543
01:10:19,409 --> 01:10:24,119
really mean it like in little<font color="#E5E5E5"> italy</font>

1544
01:10:21,989 --> 01:10:26,098
government officials keep saying

1545
01:10:24,119 --> 01:10:28,710
politicians<font color="#CCCCCC"> internets is human rights</font>

1546
01:10:26,099 --> 01:10:32,070
etc etc and then they put up all these

1547
01:10:28,710 --> 01:10:34,290
barriers to entry so that you know the

1548
01:10:32,070 --> 01:10:36,780
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> two telcos will operate and the</font>

1549
01:10:34,290 --> 01:10:38,820
local governments will keep saying<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1550
01:10:36,780 --> 01:10:42,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">kic understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Internet's humanoid and</font>

1551
01:10:38,820 --> 01:10:44,759
then they<font color="#E5E5E5"> would impose 40 permits before</font>

1552
01:10:42,119 --> 01:10:47,909
a telco can put up<font color="#E5E5E5"> one single base</font>

1553
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:49,560
station or tower so you know if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you if</font>

1554
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:52,040
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe that internet is truly a</font>

1555
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:55,050
human right then you have to facilitate

1556
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:58,199
basically access and you have to ensure

1557
01:10:55,050 --> 01:11:03,060
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the market structure is it such a</font>

1558
01:10:58,199 --> 01:11:05,400
way that<font color="#CCCCCC"> very the provider skin can</font>

1559
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:08,429
offer affordable service and that's

1560
01:11:05,400 --> 01:11:10,500
quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> a particular level of quality that</font>

1561
01:11:08,429 --> 01:11:13,770
is acceptable and then the second thing

1562
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:15,869
is that citizens can do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

1563
01:11:13,770 --> 01:11:18,599

01:11:40,889 --> 01:11:47,670
fortunately to legislate<font color="#CCCCCC"> two senators</font>

1574
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:50,940
and one congresswoman filed the bill so

1575
01:11:47,670 --> 01:11:55,080
it can happen there are initiatives that

1576

citizens individuals<font color="#CCCCCC"> can join and we're</font>

01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:06,000
ecosystem and not just you know looking

1580
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:09,630
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from an instructor point of view</font>

1581
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:13,050
or from from a pricing or marketing<font color="#CCCCCC"> part</font>

1582
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:15,659
point of view so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to seek out</font>

1583
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:18,449
these initiatives and support them and

1584
01:12:15,659 --> 01:12:21,420
really take the time<font color="#CCCCCC"> how to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

1585
01:12:18,449 --> 01:12:25,589
and not just wait for the

1586
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:27,600
with companies to provide access or wait

1587
01:12:25,590 --> 01:12:33,630
