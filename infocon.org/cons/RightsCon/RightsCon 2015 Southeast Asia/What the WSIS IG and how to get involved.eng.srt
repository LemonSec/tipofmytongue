1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
hello that sounds quite throaty doesn't

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,859
quite like that and there's a place for

3
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:09,859
coming um I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll make a start</font>

4
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:25,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">session is just to bring to give a brief</font>

5
00:00:22,289 --> 00:00:28,349
overview of the woods across<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten process</font>

6
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:31,560
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to explain what that is why</font>

7
00:00:28,349 --> 00:00:33,600
it's important to society<font color="#E5E5E5"> groups and if</font>

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,370
you're interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> in being involved how</font>

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,739
do you can do so because a number of

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,410
society<font color="#CCCCCC"> organizations who started to</font>

11
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:43,379
prepare<font color="#E5E5E5"> for discussions coming up to the</font>

12
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,468
UN general assembly in november december

13
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,899
this year which potentially have a very

14
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,539
big impact on the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet's</font>

15
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:54,360

<font color="#E5E5E5">rights and democratic potential for</font>

18
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,899
potentially a very momentous discussion

19
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,659
and it's happening<font color="#CCCCCC"> in one of the most</font>

20
00:01:02,899 --> 00:01:07,590
kind of politicized than<font color="#CCCCCC"> antagonist</font>

21
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:10,159
antagonistic environments in which you

22
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,299
could vacuum the UN General<font color="#CCCCCC"> Assembly</font>

23
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,610
where there's probably a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very low level</font>

24
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,100
of knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> about internet issues and</font>

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,580
Internet policy but a very high degree

00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:22,020
of political competition good waves so

27
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,759
from the internets point of view it's

28
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:26,548
not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place for the discussion</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

29
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,400
taking clothes and boots happening and I

30
00:01:26,549 --> 00:01:31,439
think it's useful for us to understand

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:34,890
where it came from and<font color="#E5E5E5"> essentially you</font>

32
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,320
know 10 12 years ago the UN decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

33
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:38,930
wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> information</font>

information society my colleague layer

38
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,579
again Hannah will just give you a brief

39
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:55,229
overview of where it got to and then

40
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:57,029
we'll throw it open for discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

41
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">right so minus as you put it back on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

42

director of the boat on digital I'm a

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,560
bit of a bitch I know we'll see<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in</font>

trying to engage this process of<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

we're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking to build and gentle</font>

50
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,400
cycle again orientation is this part of

51
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">the process which is coming to a head</font>

52
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,060
and it's going to culminate this

so what I'd like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly kind</font>

55
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:37,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">of give a bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a background for people</font>

who are not with the process<font color="#CCCCCC"> and don't</font>

want to spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> heart attack during pieces</font>

that property useful people have 45

60
00:02:44,349 --> 00:02:50,010
minutes a bigger purpose of this session

61
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:53,349
and we will do a quick<font color="#CCCCCC"> run-through</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

62
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,940
the process and<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we're expecting and</font>

63
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:56,980
then why just like to us to have a

64
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,680
conversation about where people are what

65
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:02,018
they're doing and a bit of extreme to

66
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,209
keep the discussion of what the

67
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,849
possibilities for society engaging the

68
00:03:04,209 --> 00:03:10,150
public interest list in this space would

69
00:03:06,849 --> 00:03:13,690
be so just briefly<font color="#E5E5E5"> going back to when</font>

70
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:19,680
the what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see is and how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's set</font>

71
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:21,519
up back in 2002<font color="#CCCCCC"> there was I think the</font>

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,359
resolution of the UN General Assembly

73
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:28,329
then set up a process after its

didn't waste for this potential at the

service of developing pool all this is

81
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:47,500
important because it highlights what the

original vs vs was meant to be about

in 2003 in 2005 the first phase which is

are actually being perpetuated now so

226
00:12:22,169 --> 00:12:25,669
the question about like<font color="#E5E5E5"> those</font>

process of how to cater to stakeholders

287
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:33,850
in person interview unfortunately we're

288
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,610
not like we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> some</font>

289
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:37,730
openness

290
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:40,220
in the end up coming over all you have

291
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,899
to be in New York but perhaps thinking

292
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,510
about on a strategic engagement because

293
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:50,500
point to that as a good example<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what</font>

294
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:53,540
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do to build upon just quickly the</font>

295
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:58,190
joining general assembly was by a

296
00:15:53,540 --> 00:16:01,069
father was a called upon UN General

297
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,959
Assembly Hall apartment was called upon

298
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:04,690
by the chance again to conduct a local

299
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:07,550
review this year I'm going to tenure

300
00:16:04,690 --> 00:16:11,029
point since the original<font color="#E5E5E5"> assistant and</font>

301
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:12,920
they<font color="#CCCCCC"> have last year decided how they're</font>

302
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:16,610
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this and the modalities for</font>

304
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:20,839
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a two-day high-level</font>

305
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:22,700
meeting that's going to happen at the

306
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,769
fringes of the generals and the New York

307
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:29,060
in December and it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

308
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:30,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">preceded preceded by an we are preceded</font>

by an<font color="#CCCCCC"> intergovernmental preparatory</font>

310
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:36,140
process which also takes into account

311
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:38,510
labels from all the relevant mrs.

312
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,730
stakeholders what I'm clear at the

313
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:43,100
moment is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that how that input is going</font>

314
00:16:40,730 --> 00:16:46,070
to be it's going to be collected

315
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:50,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">solicited and we're not going to know</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">expecting in terms of the timeline the</font>

be run from jillians of the separate and

324
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,740
and how that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sorry are they took</font>

327
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:21,459
December at this

328
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:28,600
I think that's kind of sucked it up

329
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:30,159
without anything with Australia if I

330
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:39,820
missed anything that we already know

331
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:43,960
what's that happen that's right that's

332
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:45,790
right so in terms of what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

333
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:47,920
am the agenda apart from as they said

334
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:49,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it has dual element of what's</font>

335
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:52,420
happening so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the assistance of</font>

336
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:57,520
implementation and also going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to looking</font>

337
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:59,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">at what should be next it's very likely</font>

338
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,990
that it's going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dress unresolved</font>

339
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:09,430
issues from them from the original

340
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:13,990
Summit tunnel and because I has already

341
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:14,920
said that how we achieve the society so

342
00:18:13,990 --> 00:18:16,270
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> definitely going to be a</font>

343
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:18,040
development aspect to it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

344
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:20,440
question of how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much the scraper has the</font>

345
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:25,270
chickens to achieve to achieving this

346
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:27,610
goal perhaps well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think an important</font>

347
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,590
thing to bear in mind is that whatever

348
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,300
framework do we have in the

349
00:18:29,590 --> 00:18:32,800
international system to actually support

350
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,919
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> golden to contribute to the show</font>

351
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:38,919
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the answer is not very much the</font>

352
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:41,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">current discussions about the SDGs of</font>

353
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:44,130
the sustainable development goals at the

354
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:48,370
moment have only four dimensions of the

355
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:52,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">ICTs so it's not very robust approach to</font>

356
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:52,919
to this issue and

357
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,550
if we think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> an international frame</font>

358
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:01,309
is useful then<font color="#CCCCCC"> rhesus is probably our</font>

359
00:18:58,550 --> 00:19:04,210
best bet but it is a question of how to

360
00:19:01,309 --> 00:19:06,950
make it how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually make it useful</font>

361
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:17,590
being honest about what's working what a

362
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:20,540
sport that's that's the big question

363
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:24,520
million-dollar<font color="#E5E5E5"> question so as I said</font>

364
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:29,000
that there is a this kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> territory</font>

365
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,590
it is the hunger is mandated to take it

366
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,559
to companies from all relevant

367
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:38,809
stakeholders but that might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> just like</font>

368
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:50,990
I'm sure what<font color="#E5E5E5"> confident that's what</font>

369
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:54,649
questions wrong yes the reserve means

370
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:57,620
one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the groove NGOs are starting to</font>

371
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:59,570
talk about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to intervene in this</font>

372
00:19:57,620 --> 00:20:01,928
process of engagement that point and

373
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:04,879
obviously one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the great conversation</font>

374
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:08,210
happy to human rights movements based in

375
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:10,400
New York he used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> love you Eun ji ho</font>

376
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,700
so there are people here who have<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

377
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,140
experience in New York that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be it</font>

378
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,690
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be great to plug you into that</font>

379
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:20,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">group because when that happens we need</font>

380
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:23,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out how to get into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

381
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,200
conversation

382
00:20:44,010 --> 00:21:13,750
so that limit is really for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> netting</font>

383
00:21:12,039 --> 00:21:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> because</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> increases</font>

384
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:21,669
has happened well first of all ages away

385
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:31,450
the most centralized process has been

386
00:21:21,669 --> 00:21:35,679
nice for us to have new york setting up

387
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:42,940
purposes implementation is happening

388
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:47,429
outside of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> other discussions one</font>

389
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:47,429
thing you mentioned processed

390
00:21:51,330 --> 00:22:09,990
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> very something to keep in mind as well</font>

391
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:14,699
you got the sheriff was difficult the

392
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:18,990
process of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Roland yeah in some respect</font>

393
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:28,340
since they worked for religious Action

394
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:28,340
bags so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it processes</font>

395
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:45,129
to a survey expose the multi-stakeholder

396
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:47,010
preparatory platform that just convened

397
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:51,250
in the ground to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> high level event</font>

398
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:53,440
that the IQ or of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there was a</font>

399
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:56,160
combination of the idea review of the

400
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,800
auxiliary system now and it was could be

401
00:22:56,160 --> 00:23:03,190
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last year actually started</font>

402
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:05,169
quite rare diamond in June last year

403
00:23:03,190 --> 00:23:06,910
they come<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm thinking about for the</font>

404
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:10,480
statement<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a purpose</font>

405
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:12,910
implementation they mainly focus on they

406
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,190
were meant to focus on the ITV show in

407
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:17,770
the implementation<font color="#CCCCCC"> process</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what actually</font>

408
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:22,270
went on that and the book further

409
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:25,150
further facilitated what as well and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

410
00:23:22,270 --> 00:23:29,050
as good as it was I did find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

411
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:30,550
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> sweet you say that we were kind</font>

412
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,970
of put all stakeholders in a

413
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:35,860
straitjacket escape do you enter the

414
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:38,110
process they already said well actually

415
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:40,030
we're going to start by<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussing the</font>

416
00:23:38,110 --> 00:23:41,740
existing action lines there was really a

00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">local discussion at any point that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

419
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:51,040
this useful at all and kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of push to</font>

420
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,930
do let's start talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the action</font>

421
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,510
alliance that was it so there was no

422
00:23:52,930 --> 00:23:57,460
question of why the deception lines work

423
00:23:55,510 --> 00:24:00,780
and this framework was still applicable

424
00:23:57,460 --> 00:24:00,780
in anybody<font color="#CCCCCC"> refineries</font>

425
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,279
I

426
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:08,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think one of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> discussions just fun</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">picture about suicide two groups we</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think when our reflection is if</font>

you what we do to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open in civil society</font>

432
00:25:18,139 --> 00:25:23,928
is reacting to what other people do and

00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:26,509
respond to<font color="#E5E5E5"> positions developed by</font>

438
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:36,619
don't really impact on it because we're

439
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,220
always reacting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've done so</font>

440
00:25:36,619 --> 00:25:40,970
one of the things we try to do is to say

441
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:42,379
regardless of what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

442
00:25:40,970 --> 00:25:43,970
government's might try to do have a

443
00:25:42,379 --> 00:25:47,059
process it works what is it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

444
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:49,909
would want wrong a review<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this whole</font>

00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:54,590
world<font color="#E5E5E5"> summit and I think we fixed on</font>

446
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:56,769
three issues one was a reinforcement of

447
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:59,720
our commitment<font color="#CCCCCC"> to multi-stakeholder</font>

448
00:25:56,769 --> 00:26:01,489
processes of<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision making which for</font>

449
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,989
us is important because it recognizes

450
00:26:01,489 --> 00:26:05,749
the legitimate role of civil society

451
00:26:02,989 --> 00:26:08,289
groups to participate on Internet policy

452
00:26:05,749 --> 00:26:10,700
discussions and shape the environment

453
00:26:08,289 --> 00:26:13,489
secondly have a strong human rights

454
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:15,919
focus and say whatever arrangements are

455
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:17,539
adopted they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be they should</font>

456
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,029
respect the principle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights</font>

457
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:21,649
apply online as well as offline and that

458
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:23,809
back human rights should be integral to

459
00:26:21,649 --> 00:26:25,580
that both the governance and the

460

462
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:35,809
that there is a development agenda still

it's more or less reached the easy wins

different political requirements if you

479
00:27:10,009 --> 00:27:14,300
want to like fiber cables across

480
00:27:12,410 --> 00:27:16,550
land of Africa for example that raises a

481
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:18,980
whole bunch of questions of governance

482
00:27:16,550 --> 00:27:20,510
and political stability so there's a

483
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:23,180
there's a very green development agenda

484
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:25,330
which we are framing as about access to

485
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,710
infrastructure for dirty and

486
00:27:25,330 --> 00:27:30,590
availability of relevant local content

487
00:27:27,710 --> 00:27:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">through local languages so it's not just</font>

488
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">a kind of an elite and a leader</font>

489
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:37,610
mechanism so those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the those are the</font>

00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:40,940
issues that<font color="#E5E5E5"> still as the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> South</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Koreans</font>

491
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:42,699
that took forever so far have decided

492
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,380
they want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on we set up for</font>

494
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:50,810
against the process like more of a

00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:53,379
tactical advisory group if you like to

496
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:55,970
advise<font color="#CCCCCC"> us on how we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually took me</font>

secondly once to find a human rights

agenda through this process proactively

499
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:02,630
the third one to develop a

500
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:04,280
multi-stakeholder concept and

501
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:05,840
multi-state will be working<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the</font>

502
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,879
thought to develop a hyper development

503
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,050
agenda so regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

504
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,070
government's do because what the

505
00:28:09,050 --> 00:28:16,460
companies say we have our our set of

506
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:18,800
thoughts views and inputs we want to put

<font color="#E5E5E5">into the process to transfer gate sorry</font>

508
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:24,159
through his process of them it was a

509
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,550
very ad hoc group of organizations

510
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:30,860
comparison to<font color="#E5E5E5"> UNESCO home search it was</font>

511
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:33,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally the kind of 30 or so groups</font>

00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:36,850
who may have managed to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make had a treat</font>

513
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:39,290
for UNICEF this isn't to<font color="#CCCCCC"> say this is</font>

514
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:41,179
there may be other issues may be the

515
00:28:39,290 --> 00:28:42,610
wrong issues and I mean we would

516
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:44,840
encourage anybody to set up

517
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:47,540

00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:55,940
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> November December actually at</font>

521
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:59,270
the last idea might think i was talking

522
00:28:55,940 --> 00:29:00,950
to you called constants from<font color="#CCCCCC"> my sock and</font>

523
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:04,310
they were we were sitting down and

524
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:06,590
talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> lgf renewal and how that's</font>

525
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:08,870
part of digestion or as part of this

526
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:10,909
process right so whether or not capture

527
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:11,959
gets<font color="#CCCCCC"> revealed will be the side and we</font>

were sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> and sitting that will</font>

529
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,480
actually be agree with this like

530
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:17,610
community<font color="#E5E5E5"> end the site of groups have a</font>

531
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:20,520
lot in common it is they<font color="#CCCCCC"> could share a</font>

532
00:29:17,610 --> 00:29:22,260
lot of common common<font color="#E5E5E5"> interests so why</font>

533
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:23,940
don't we kind of come together<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we</font>

534
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:26,460
made them in the current level<font color="#CCCCCC"> d margins</font>

535
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:28,890
of this let's go home for it said first

536
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:31,140
we start talking between with high

537
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,880
stocking suspending rooms and ICC basis

538
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:35,130
International Chamber of Commerce will

539
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,350
survive at all so we actually had a

540
00:29:35,130 --> 00:29:39,750
civil society part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> meeting where</font>

541
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:41,459
we discussed our<font color="#E5E5E5"> issues and our</font>

00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:44,130
strategies and how to approach shot and

00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've also how to really go that the two</font>

544
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,340
hour session with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the different</font>

545
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,840
communities where<font color="#CCCCCC"> we had I think</font>

community private sector and<font color="#CCCCCC"> governments</font>

547
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:58,320
to discuss and where the common very

548
00:29:56,100 --> 00:30:00,659
common interests lies and where we can

549
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">collaborate going forward they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recognize</font>

550
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:11,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there might be issues will be</font>

551
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:15,260
diverge yes I'm sorry I question the

552
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:18,180
question budget is that because you

553
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:21,900
think the<font color="#CCCCCC"> I cioppino</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be part of the</font>

554
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:23,880
multi-stakeholder that's definitely

555
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:25,830
written but all the source touching

556
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,560
which exact same class here they want

557
00:30:25,830 --> 00:30:31,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">the I can't really argue with a lot of</font>

558
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:36,300
the magnet with a solid<font color="#E5E5E5"> mandate and now</font>

559
00:30:31,410 --> 00:30:38,100
we're going to attract<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just just</font>

560
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:40,649
one<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing I'm not however they can say</font>

561
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:43,590
have you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that number</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of groups</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

563
00:30:43,590 --> 00:30:49,110
so we don't want you just to sing being

564
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,680
there it needs to be contributing to do

565
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:56,760
we get there we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> that recommendation</font>

566
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:58,770
that came out with them working the

00:30:56,760 --> 00:31:01,050
system working with my magic includes to

568
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:03,000
be implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> that needs to be done</font>

569
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:05,639
that needs to happen so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is up</font>

570
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,610
there just to exist discussion forum

571
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:10,740
although that has<font color="#CCCCCC"> valued</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sounder but</font>

00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,629
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are conditioned allottees even on</font>
