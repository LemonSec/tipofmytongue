lot about why I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this conference is</font>

18
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,740
a little bit special and obviously

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of work and a lot of heart</font>

21
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,840
you know there's sort of moments at the

22
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:27,119
conference for me anyway which sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,439
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> shift in the way that I have</font>

24
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,729
thought about something<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I think</font>

25
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">about something in a new way or I have a</font>

26
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,829
jolt which influences how I'm going to

27
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:41,280
approach a<font color="#CCCCCC"> new tactic and new a new</font>

28
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,779
strategy or a new practice and then

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,090
sometimes it's just a<font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation that</font>

30
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,810
actually I found turns it into a

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:52,590
partnership and for me that happened

32
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:55,439
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday I went to the digital</font>

that would never ever happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm hoping</font>

87
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:25,770
that all of you have had that some<font color="#E5E5E5"> form</font>

92
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,940
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the outcomes and at this point I</font>

hang on for this amazing access now team

102
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:08,919

00:05:18,249 --> 00:05:24,719
last of which is Nick D'Agostino who is

104

111
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:52,330
course it's like my region and well this

112
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">i know one outcome is really hard there</font>

113
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,700
are so<font color="#E5E5E5"> many right but just for the sake</font>

114
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">of an example i</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> will just say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that for</font>

115
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:03,340
instance several brazilian activists

116
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,200
here heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> about a dangerous package of</font>

117
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:06,460
8 bills that have<font color="#CCCCCC"> been going to be</font>

118
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,159
pushed into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> house of representatives</font>

119
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">in brazil and we held an emergency</font>

120
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:14,470
session different groups and their got

121
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,300
together and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> practically in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

122
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,870
same session that you wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see it</font>

123
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,660
recorded in youtube channel they came up

124
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a with a strategy and a declaration</font>

125
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,380
and now that's being insured so so

126
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:29,320
that's probably one of the things that

127
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:32,440
shows us the power of convening get

128
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:34,480
together and and strategizing so you can

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,780
find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the web page of X now in</font>

135
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,660
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> Amie Stepanovich</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm the US policy</font>

00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">that I kept hearing a lot about was</font>

138
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:06,010
encryption and that might be because<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

spent a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of us the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> first day in here</font>

00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:13,490
in New York the demo room was primarily

301
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:16,340
about stories we had technologists

302
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:18,320
journalists activists users and trainers

303
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:19,910
all in the same room so it's that

304
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,920

Nicholas Sayre Oliva here from intra

317
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:04,220
on the policy team based in DC so it

318
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,870
wasn't that<font color="#E5E5E5"> long ago that we would have</font>

319
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,920
conferences that would focus on

320
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:08,870
cybersecurity and you talk about

321
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:10,160
military approaches and you would talk

322
00:15:08,870 --> 00:15:11,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">about critical infrastructure and you</font>

323
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:13,100
would have human rights conferences

324
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:15,290
which would be totally separate but I

325
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,670
think we saw entire conference full of

326
00:15:15,290 --> 00:15:19,010
people who<font color="#CCCCCC"> could have sophisticated</font>

327
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:20,240
conversations about cybersecurity and do

328
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:22,220
it in a way that they were considering

329
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:23,150
the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights impact and thinking</font>

330
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">about it for me Human Rights framework</font>

331
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:26,000
and I think that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really an amazing</font>

332
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:30,100
achievement that we've gotten this<font color="#E5E5E5"> far</font>

333
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,100
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just say go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on in cyber</font>

334
00:15:34,089 --> 00:15:39,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">and.and I'm Nick D'Agostino I'm based in</font>

335
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,499
New York and the resident Canadian on

336
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:45,019
staff had access now and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would like to</font>

337
00:15:42,499 --> 00:15:46,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">i mean as much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as the the outcomes of</font>

338
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,680
2016 are still going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i think some</font>

339
00:15:46,999 --> 00:15:51,439
kind of the submerged outcomes will

340
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:53,209
still be you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming about i think</font>

341
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:55,939
it's it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good look forward and</font>

342
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:59,229
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm actually have the the pleasure of</font>

343
00:15:55,939 --> 00:16:02,748
announcing where Bryce God 2017 will be

344
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:07,119
and so the host city of Rights Klein

345
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:07,119
2017 will be Brussels

346
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:21,380
which is excellent i mean and so there's

347
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:23,860
many really good reasons why<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

348
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,480
we're bringing you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> brussels and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

349
00:16:23,860 --> 00:16:28,460
think the first reason is you know

350
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,400
Europe and in Brussels is is a

351
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,830
international<font color="#CCCCCC"> hub for so many you know</font>

352
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">global policies and really they're</font>

353
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:38,390
really the decision makers for a lot of

354
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:40,400
global policies everything from net

355
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:44,540
neutrality to data retention data

356
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:46,670
protection and trade laws and so I think

357
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:49,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we want to really Bing bring the</font>

358
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:54,770
global civil society you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> back and</font>

359
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have in and and yeah</font>

360
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:59,449
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that they have a saying these</font>

361
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,949
decisions another reason is because the

362
00:16:59,450 --> 00:17:02,780
global tech companies from around the

363
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:05,060
world have such it has such an influence

364
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:06,709
and such a presence in Brussels and we

365
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,079
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these decisions</font>

366
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:11,600
and these discussions have the the tech

367
00:17:09,079 --> 00:17:14,000
community present and lastly you know

368
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:16,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're we want to be you know we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

369
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,250
everyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to bring support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

370
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:21,198
European civil society and bring support

371
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,849
to to Europe and I think that writes

372
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,560
gone as a community can bring a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

373
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:26,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">this support</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and so we're very excited</font>

374
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:30,110
for that and I'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to it now like</font>

375
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:32,270
pass off the the ceremonial baton to the

376
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:34,870
Brussels office and so we'd only have a

377
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,870
time but

378
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:42,928
