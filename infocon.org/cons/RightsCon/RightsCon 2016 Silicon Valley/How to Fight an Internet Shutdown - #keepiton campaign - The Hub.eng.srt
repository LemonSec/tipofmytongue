campaign to fight internet shutdowns

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,430
it's a trend we've seen worldwide and

34
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:39,560
just to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> very relevant some of us</font>

35
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:39,560
woke up today to this headline that

36
00:16:39,829 --> 00:16:43,560
North Korea ordered an internet shut

37
00:16:42,149 --> 00:16:44,970
down so in case<font color="#CCCCCC"> you were thinking this</font>

38
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,910
is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that hasn't happened for a</font>

39
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:52,889
long time it<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened today and what</font>

40
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:54,750
we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do today is will give an</font>

41
00:16:52,889 --> 00:17:00,329
overview relying on the experts<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

42
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:02,189
room and then the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece depending</font>

43
00:17:00,329 --> 00:17:03,969
on the mood see how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people feel if they</font>

44
00:17:02,189 --> 00:17:06,750
want to we have a<font color="#CCCCCC"> really cool</font>

45
00:17:03,970 --> 00:17:09,100
interactive role play where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:11,020
experience an internet shut down you

47
00:17:09,099 --> 00:17:14,408
play the role of<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the major actors</font>

48
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:16,059
and shutdowns will explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and you</font>

49
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:19,990
can try to find<font color="#E5E5E5"> a solution what would</font>

50
00:17:16,059 --> 00:17:21,730
you do we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about some of those</font>

51
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:24,400
solutions and then at four o'clock and

52
00:17:21,730 --> 00:17:25,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just mention this now we are going</font>

53
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:27,699
to be creating an international

54
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,250
definition of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet shutdowns we've</font>

55
00:17:27,699 --> 00:17:32,350
already crowd-sourced them from experts

56
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:35,190
around the world and at four we're going

57
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:38,350
to meet in one of the partitioned rooms

58
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,900
inside this room to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come to a</font>

59
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:41,918
solution and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then upload</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it on Wikipedia</font>

60
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,679
it'll be the first international

61
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:46,539
definition of shutdowns on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia</font>

62
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:48,340
right now if you go to Wikipedia and you

63
00:17:46,539 --> 00:17:51,658
type in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internet shut down it says</font>

64
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:54,250
see internet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that helpful</font>

65
00:17:51,659 --> 00:17:58,480
so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can do better and call</font>

66
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:59,710
attention to this problem and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just</font>

67
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,830
tell you now there are things you can do

68
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:04,090
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you only have a few minutes</font>

69
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:07,210
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> sign up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for our campaign</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font>

70
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:08,678
going to pass<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the clipboard you</font>

71
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,600
can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with our definition as I</font>

72
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:12,789
mentioned you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can do the role play and</font>

73
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:16,750
we've got a resource page that we've

74
00:18:12,789 --> 00:18:20,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">created on access now and that's just as</font>

75
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:23,140
access now org slash internet hyphen

76
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,600
shutdowns so those are<font color="#CCCCCC"> some things you</font>

77
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:30,100
can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll remind you of those in a</font>

78
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,780
minute and with that I'll kick<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

79
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:34,510
Peter who can give you a nice overview

80
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:38,678
of the challenges we're facing this very

81
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:41,020
real problem thanks jg and first of all

82
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:45,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">I prefer to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think of myself as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> session</font>

83
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:47,950
nista rather than a panelist and yeah

84
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:51,700
I'm glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about this this problem</font>

85
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:55,539
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are some some difficulties</font>

86
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:58,240
though in that there are more internet

87
00:18:55,539 --> 00:18:59,559
shutdowns than we know about the ones

88
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:02,620
that we've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that we see in</font>

89
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:05,590
headlines are the exception I think

90
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:08,439
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> the norm so this problem</font>

91
00:19:05,590 --> 00:19:12,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">dates back on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at least as</font>

92
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:16,059
far back as 2007 when<font color="#E5E5E5"> Myanmar shut down</font>

93
00:19:12,730 --> 00:19:17,720
access to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet but of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

94
00:19:16,059 --> 00:19:21,399
think the seminal moment

95
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:25,670
that we remember was Egypt in January

96
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:30,050
2011 so that's when the government went

97
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:33,250
to the executives the offices of three

98
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:37,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the telcos operating in the country</font>

99
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:41,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">forced them to shut down the internet</font>

100
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:45,760
and mobile networks and also force them

101
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:48,740
to send pro-government propaganda<font color="#E5E5E5"> by SMS</font>

102
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:50,960
so this took<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world by storm and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

103
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:55,790
opened<font color="#E5E5E5"> up our eyes to the the</font>

104
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:58,540
possibility of a kill switch and this

105
00:19:55,790 --> 00:20:01,430
possibility had very real repercussions

106
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:03,080
and namely sending more people<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto the</font>

107
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:07,390
streets<font color="#E5E5E5"> to protest that regime which</font>

108
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,580
didn't last three weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> past that event</font>

109
00:20:07,390 --> 00:20:14,530
another response longer-term to that

110
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:17,480
shutdown was the the creation of more

111
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:20,780
collaborative forum for civil society

112
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:23,390
and the private sector<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the telcos to</font>

113
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,820
discuss these and more challenges that

114
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,590
that sector faces on<font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights so</font>

115
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:31,820
this was a vulnerability that was

116
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:35,720
exploited by a motivated regime<font color="#E5E5E5"> in its</font>

117
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:37,669
in its death throes and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we got together</font>

118
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:41,510
the telcos to patch that vulnerability

119
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:45,530
and that's kind of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> path that we're</font>

120
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:47,240
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> on today however that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is not the</font>

121
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:50,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the history of the internet</font>

122
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,750
shut down rather it kind of went into

123
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:59,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">hiding a bit and took a more insidious</font>

124
00:20:53,750 --> 00:21:02,870
form we saw in Sudan in late 2013 when

125
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:06,500
the government ordered telcos to shut

126
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:10,239
down networks at the height of a protest

127
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,530
public protest movement in Khartoum<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

128
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:16,030
once those networks were shut down the

129
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:19,730
government brutally repressed arresting

130
00:21:16,030 --> 00:21:22,790
17 hundred and vigils and killing scores

131
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:25,670
we don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people died in</font>

132
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:27,530
that repression partly because of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

133
00:21:25,670 --> 00:21:30,560
difficulty of getting information<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font>

134
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:31,139
the country at the time so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font>

135
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:33,450
is one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

136
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:37,500
shutdown's that looks a bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> more modern</font>

137
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:39,600
in that it was very<font color="#E5E5E5"> effective operated</font>

138
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,670
largely under the radar and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

139
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">country's opposition movement has not</font>

140
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:50,760
reached that same peak of resistance

141
00:21:44,570 --> 00:21:53,070
since it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pretty picture there</font>

142
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:55,830
was one telco that we spoke with

143
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">directly involved in that whose CEO</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">pushed back and says he lost his job as</font>

00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:04,320
a result of that about a month<font color="#E5E5E5"> later</font>

146
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:06,150
itsudatte<font color="#E5E5E5"> l and and one other telco that</font>

147
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:11,100
did work with us in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the aftermath of</font>

148
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:13,800
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> shutdown moving to one more that I</font>

149
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:17,310
want to highlight jun 2014 and the

150
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:20,399
Central African Republic we we finally I

151
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:24,270
think operationalized this this

152
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:26,760
vulnerability<font color="#E5E5E5"> and patching system that</font>

153
00:22:24,270 --> 00:22:30,389
we had set up where the telcos alerted

154
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:35,040
us of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> request to shut down mobile</font>

155
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:38,640
networks<font color="#CCCCCC"> and SMS and we advise those</font>

156
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,770
telcos those telcos took the advice did

157
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:43,170
use number of tools of their disposal

158
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:46,560
organized with their peer companies and

159
00:22:43,170 --> 00:22:49,500
push back to effectively tell the

160
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,399
government no more and they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

161
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:55,170
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> those networks back online so</font>

162
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:58,170
those<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some of the early examples and</font>

163
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:00,540
I think we'll hear more but we are

164
00:22:58,170 --> 00:23:04,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to systematize this the learnings</font>

165
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:07,920
and invite you all in to our campaign in

166
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:10,440
order to end this worst practice thank

167
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:13,880
you Peter and we'll move now to talk

168
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:17,040
with chin my who can speak about

169
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:19,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience in India from a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legal and</font>

170
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:22,159
policy perspective and if you'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

171
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:26,190
about other countries in the region

172
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:27,900
tonight thank you I was in a session

173
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:30,270
yesterday in which we were discussing

174
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,130
this upcoming campaign and I was

175
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:34,020
studying these guys how we write the

176
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:35,790
freedom on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the net report every year and</font>

177
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:37,889
part of that involves counting the

178
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:41,370
number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times internet shutdowns take</font>

179
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,800
place in India and so last year<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

180
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:44,729
mid last year when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we when our reporting</font>

181
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:47,760
period ended

182
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:49,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">dia was in a great place we had had less</font>

183
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:51,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">than the usual number which is it's</font>

184
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:54,900
normally tour you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes three</font>

185
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:56,879
per yard and typically more in in

186
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,500
regions in which there's conflict<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

187
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,250
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in a state of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> emergency most of</font>

188
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:04,440
the time the laws stayed exactly the

189
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:07,710
same there was no change<font color="#E5E5E5"> in laws but</font>

190
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:11,040
between august and october last year we

191
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,440
suddenly had six internet shutdowns in a

192
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:16,290
state that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually mainland india</font>

193
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:19,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's it's not a particularly war-torn</font>

194
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:22,290
region and we had two more in other

195
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,150
states just in that short period and so

196
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:25,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the learning from this is</font>

197
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:27,990
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if you're from a country in</font>

198
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:30,510
which this<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't happening right now</font>

199
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:32,940
it's worth getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> into this campaign</font>

200
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,500
looking at your legal system and seeing

201
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,870
whether there's any possibility for

202
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:39,570
abuse because our legal system stayed

203
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:41,639
exactly the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> but executive action</font>

204
00:24:39,570 --> 00:24:44,220
changed and some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons for</font>

205
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:45,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">which these shutdowns took place are you</font>

206
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:47,010
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still getting over them one of</font>

207
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:49,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">our accession downs took place because</font>

208
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:51,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">there was an exam going on and they felt</font>

209
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:54,690
that the copying might lead to public

210
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:57,059
disorder and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is like is you</font>

211
00:24:54,690 --> 00:25:00,390
complete and I'm not making this<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you</font>

212
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:03,360
know fish eyed worm so the learning for

213
00:25:00,390 --> 00:25:05,760
this from all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this for us was that if</font>

214
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:07,559
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have broadly worded law it means</font>

215
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:09,150
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might come a time when it's</font>

216
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:10,830
when it's abuse and this is happening

217
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:12,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">right now in India lawyers have</font>

218
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:13,740
attempted to challenge this they've

219
00:25:12,419 --> 00:25:17,040
taken this to the courts and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

220
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:19,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked right now is that don't word your</font>

221
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:21,299
exception so broadly that the government

222
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:23,190
can go to any sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of small court and</font>

223
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:24,809
get an order or an internet shut down

224
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:26,669
but it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> honestly it's been a little</font>

225
00:25:24,809 --> 00:25:28,230
hard convincing the court said this is

226
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:30,090
necessary<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's it's been a work in</font>

227
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:31,799
progress and right now the government is

228
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:34,580
still shutting down the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

229
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:38,600
what i would call chilling<font color="#E5E5E5"> regularity</font>

still can't think of all the different

<font color="#CCCCCC">ways</font>

that losing connectivity you know

and their financial we you know have

also encourage you to to help document

364
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:06,860
the costs of network shutdowns what we

365
00:31:04,010 --> 00:31:08,330
look at economically is you know as I

366
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,129
think we heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> from Kelly those those</font>

direct costs of not being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> access</font>

development writ large and on a micro

375
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,470
economic level are both impacted by

376
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:40,880
these shutdowns we need to quantify

377
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:43,100
those costs and make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that case beyond</font>

00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:45,409
economics you know mobile health a

379
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:49,490
health is crucially important especially

380
00:31:45,409 --> 00:31:53,090
in rural areas these are again things

381
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:55,220
that impact people's daily lives without

382
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:57,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">this connectivity the political</font>

383
00:31:55,220 --> 00:32:00,320
consequences are perhaps what<font color="#CCCCCC"> we think</font>

384
00:31:57,020 --> 00:32:03,500
of most directly<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mubarak is one case</font>

385
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:06,439
where the shutdown created a backlash

386
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:08,990
that that toppled the regime that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the</font>

387
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:10,340
exception these shutdowns are spreading

388
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:13,880
as a worse practice because they are

389
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:17,510
effective tools for regimes that would

390
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:20,210
abuse human rights in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to increase</font>

391
00:32:17,510 --> 00:32:22,280
their longevity so those political

392
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:25,010
consequences are irreversible especially

393
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:26,899
when these occurred during elections and

394
00:32:25,010 --> 00:32:29,720
then you know the human rights civil and

395
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,429
political rights I impact some not just

396
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:35,670
your ability to communicate but your

397
00:32:31,429 --> 00:32:39,270
ability to access information is blocked

398
00:32:35,670 --> 00:32:40,950
and yeah I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go thank you so</font>

399
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:42,420
again looking around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the room I know</font>

400
00:32:40,950 --> 00:32:44,910
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some real experts on this so</font>

401
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:47,220
we'll just briefly describe the campaign

402
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:49,680
and what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to try to do to</font>

403
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:51,990
fight back first of all we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> raise</font>

404
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:54,030
awareness<font color="#E5E5E5"> about this problem Peter</font>

405
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:57,510
mentioned Pakistan our partners advice

406
00:32:54,030 --> 00:32:59,190
for all there was<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shutdown on Monday</font>

407
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:02,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">and Tuesday I mean this is a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real</font>

408
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:05,790
thing telling<font color="#CCCCCC"> people the frequency</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

409
00:33:02,790 --> 00:33:11,250
impacts but that there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> also ways to</font>

410
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:13,100
fight back we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically aiming for</font>

411
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:15,570
the top we think that the UN and

412
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:18,169
intergovernmental bodies can make huge

413
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:20,520
statements but that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not the only place</font>

414
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:22,200
we also think regional bodies like the

415
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,260
African Union and the Organization of

416
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,820
American States can make a big impact

417
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:31,950
and then at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the country level there are</font>

418
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,570
ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> effect change there too so we're</font>

419
00:33:31,950 --> 00:33:34,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be doing a broad-based campaign</font>

420
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,550
tactically we're going to be moving

421
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:40,500
where we're most effective chinmaya<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

422
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,110
will have a question for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

423
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,000
because there is a lock law case in

424
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:47,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">India would you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind just mentioning</font>

425
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:51,260
that briefly because that is a tactic

426
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:51,260
that I think is pretty exciting

427
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,420
you

428
00:34:02,070 --> 00:34:09,179
yeah i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the keys that we're trying</font>

429
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:10,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">to make as in lawyers that are in</font>

430
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:12,509
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> session right now we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font>

431
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:14,100
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make before our lawmakers are not</font>

432
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">following that low what they're doing is</font>

433
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:16,799
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the Criminal</font>

434
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:19,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">Procedure Code which has the sort of</font>

435
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:21,960
this very broad ranging power that

436
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,340
permits<font color="#CCCCCC"> States to take action basically</font>

437
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:25,470
whenever there is a public order or a

438
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:27,330
riot problem and the thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> with that is</font>

439
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:29,939
that they're able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to you know to a</font>

440
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:31,590
magistrate and get an order for an

441
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet shut down and the magistrate is</font>

442
00:34:31,590 --> 00:34:35,130
not really equipped to understand what

443
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:37,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">is going on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and whether a full internet</font>

444
00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:38,850

these<font color="#E5E5E5"> circumstances so the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> case we're</font>

446
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:44,489
trying to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> is basically to narrow</font>

447
00:34:42,449 --> 00:34:47,250
this it's really difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince</font>

448
00:34:44,489 --> 00:34:49,649
governments to never have internet shut

449
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:51,630
downs but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> feel like if we can make</font>

450
00:34:49,650 --> 00:34:53,160
sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they do it very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sparingly and</font>

451
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:55,860
there's some accountability that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

452
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:57,870
help thank you yeah and we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

453
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:59,670
mention it at access we're fortunate to

454
00:34:57,870 --> 00:35:02,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">have our 24-hour digital security</font>

455
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:05,250
helpline and we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> are alerted to</font>

456
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:06,930
some of these disconnections through

457
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:09,780
that mechanism and we've developed a

458
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:12,060
rapid response plan so that you know

459
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:14,520
reactively when they happen we can do

460
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,360
our best to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people online make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

461
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're safe and they're</font>

462
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:20,970
communicating securely but this campaign

463
00:35:18,270 --> 00:35:22,470
is a proactive strategy so we do need we

464
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:24,240
do need more research we need more

465
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:25,560
information about what's happening we

466
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,959
need more information as Peter mentioned

467
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,640
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the economic costs we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

468
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:32,070
information about where the blocking is

469
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:34,730
happening on the network and we're

470
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:37,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">working with organizations like</font>

471
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,500
measurement lab we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> working talking to</font>

472
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,120
folks at<font color="#CCCCCC"> moonee probe and private sector</font>

473
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:44,670
companies like dying that have really

474
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">great probes on the network so there's</font>

475
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,090
just a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work to be done to</font>

476
00:35:46,470 --> 00:35:52,700
document this phenomenon and we would

477
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:54,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">love your help we've got a clipboard and</font>

478
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:58,230
you know you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> really make a</font>

479
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,050
difference so we will<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it up to</font>

480
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:04,080
questions now before we we break for the

481
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:08,070
interactive role play so if you have a

482
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:10,860
question you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can use slide 0 or you can</font>

483
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">just raise your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand and we'll get you a</font>

484
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,980
microphone

485
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:25,420
yeah you can shout it will repeat the

486
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:25,420
question yeah

487
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:46,670
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is have we considered</font>

488
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:50,030
funding sort of circumvention or mesh

489
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:55,240
technologies that would allow you to

490
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:55,240
help push back against shutdowns<font color="#CCCCCC"> Peter</font>

491
00:36:55,900 --> 00:37:01,880
funding I yeah access does have a new

492
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:04,580
grants program which you know we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should</font>

493
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:07,460
say is something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to</font>

494
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:10,370
discuss with everyone there has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

495
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,410
lot of attention<font color="#E5E5E5"> to resilience and</font>

496
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:15,220
Teucer convention technologies and we

497
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:18,500
certainly encourage that to take place

498
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:21,439
you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are pushing for I think</font>

499
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:25,030
primarily is a new norm that shutting

500
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,710
down networks is not acceptable practice

501
00:37:25,030 --> 00:37:30,580
short of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that though and I think we've</font>

502
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:34,310
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how effective VPNs can be</font>

503
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:36,950
and we certainly push users towards

504
00:37:34,310 --> 00:37:39,500
those tools that can that can help

505
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:41,390
circumvent and and get their messages

506
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:43,700
out so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know whether its private</font>

507
00:37:41,390 --> 00:37:45,740
sector companies like Twitter rolling

508
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,890
out some sort of workarounds in these

509
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:51,740
situations whether you know its users

510
00:37:48,890 --> 00:37:55,310
flocking to new tools as as I think it

511
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:57,020
happened in Hong Kong or whether it's

512
00:37:55,310 --> 00:37:59,930
you know having those those kind of

513
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:02,720
resilient and mesh and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intranet</font>

514
00:37:59,930 --> 00:38:06,680
networks in place before this sort of

515
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,899
thing happens we support more research

516
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,240
and more development and more attention

517
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to how those networks and tools can be</font>

518
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:16,390
used securely and openly and effectively

519
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:19,970
and I mean maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we could just ask</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Kelly</font>

520
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:24,339
how did were people<font color="#E5E5E5"> using mesh</font>

521
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:26,629
networking during the Uganda shut down

522
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:31,820
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools were you mentioned the</font>

523
00:38:26,630 --> 00:38:33,020
virtual private networks yes so there

524
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:35,000
were a couple of tools before we are

525
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:39,070
using if we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> using better Nate we're</font>

526
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:41,120
using<font color="#CCCCCC"> psiphon to thunderbird cyberghost</font>

527
00:38:39,070 --> 00:38:44,450
approach was but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that true it</font>

528
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:46,580
was used most was a sigh phone is one

529
00:38:44,450 --> 00:38:48,799
particular VPN that was you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

530
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:50,569
downloaded more than they are the

531
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:52,480
reserve that was the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> one why use in</font>

532
00:38:50,570 --> 00:38:54,780
to communicate

533
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,750
great thank you and if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

534
00:38:54,780 --> 00:39:00,220
what it might be like well we'll take

535
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:01,690
maybe two more questions but then I

536
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:03,368
think we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should break for the role play</font>

537
00:39:01,690 --> 00:39:06,040
because you can decide whether you use a

538
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:08,400
mesh network in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the role play any other</font>

539
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:08,400
questions

540
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:21,780
okay well thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> so much for coming</font>

541
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:25,860
and what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do is ask you to</font>

542
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,120
get into groups of six it's a fun

543
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:29,340
interactive role play we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

544
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:31,290
come to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> around and we're going to</font>

545
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">simulate a shutdown and then reconvene</font>

546
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:36,259
afterwards so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two main things</font>

547
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,580
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to understand from the role play</font>

548
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:41,610
after you simulate the shutdown in your

549
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:42,720
group were you a PM scaring some people

550
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:44,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">other some people don't want to do</font>

551
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,629
interactive role plays which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally</font>

552
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,799
understand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this there are enough of</font>

553
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:50,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">you here where I think we can have a</font>

554
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:52,170
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> one so the two questions are you</font>

555
00:39:50,250 --> 00:39:54,570
going to turn the internet back on does

556
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:56,370
your group reach a solution based on the

557
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:58,140
fact pattern that we shared so that's

558
00:39:56,370 --> 00:40:00,720
that's one of the and then the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other one</font>

559
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:03,509
is what other creative solutions did you

560
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,009
come up with so we'll break now and the

561
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:07,290
tables are perfect it's the perfect size

562
00:40:05,010 --> 00:40:09,710
so if you could just gather in groups of

563
00:40:07,290 --> 00:40:15,509
six and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll distribute the information</font>

564
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:17,130
to to the group's thanks to the

565
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:18,420
panelists<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want to mention because not</font>

566
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:20,730
all of them<font color="#CCCCCC"> can stay with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> us but thank</font>

567
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,200
you so much for joining<font color="#E5E5E5"> us today thanks</font>

568
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:24,200
Jim why thank you

569
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:42,029
if your access staff if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help us</font>

570
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:46,280
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> in get folks organized into groups</font>
