lawyers and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy to have all</font>

20
00:06:54,589 --> 00:06:59,210
the great panelists we have today to

21
00:06:56,419 --> 00:07:02,900
discuss a litigation as an advocacy tool

22
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:05,029
for policy changes if you've been right

23
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:08,899
down here two years ago we had a session

24
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:10,430
called fire the lawyers which explained

25
00:07:08,899 --> 00:07:12,139
the title of this panel because two

26
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,610
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago we were in a situation where</font>

27
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:15,110
we were thinking where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't need</font>

28
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:17,539
that much lawyer<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe with a lot of</font>

29
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:19,819
engineer we can fit fix all of the

30
00:07:17,539 --> 00:07:23,509
problem of the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we should be</font>

31
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:25,849
fine we've unfortunately seen over the

32
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,490
last year<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we still need litigation</font>

33
00:07:25,849 --> 00:07:30,740
and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a growing movement and</font>

34
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:33,860
we need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> bring back the lawyer to the</font>

35
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:35,599
room which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is why we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the panel here</font>

36
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,649
today and we'll be discussing

37
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:41,779
experiences<font color="#CCCCCC"> in litigation in other types</font>

38
00:07:39,649 --> 00:07:43,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">of remedies in order to bring policy</font>

39
00:07:41,779 --> 00:07:47,629
changes<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've not been able to get</font>

40
00:07:43,669 --> 00:07:49,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">through advocacy so I will let the</font>

41
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,589
panelists explained already their

42
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:55,008
experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we'll start first with</font>

43
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nana youngson from MLD I to give us</font>

44
00:07:55,009 --> 00:07:57,250
there

45
00:07:57,710 --> 00:08:02,180
so my<font color="#CCCCCC"> name is nany ansa and the media</font>

46
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,420
had the legal director from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the media</font>

47
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,680
Legal Defense Initiative short mo di we

48
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,420
are an organization that works worldwide

49
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,100
to help journalists bloggers and

50
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:13,310
independent media defend their rights

51
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,050
and the reason why I'm on the panel I

52
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,270
suppose it's because litigation is our

53
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:19,490
bread and butter and we came into

54
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:21,440
existence to make sure that journalists

55
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,150
bloggers when they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> sued for doing</font>

56
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,610
their work wouldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> be encumbered too</font>

57
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:27,289
much by these legal proceedings we would

58
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:29,210
take away that burden as much as we can

59
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:32,050
so they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually able to continue</font>

60
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:35,150
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> their work and our support</font>

61
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:37,419
consists of both providing very concrete

62
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">ad hoc support for individual cases</font>

63
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:41,809
anywhere in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world helping someone</font>

64
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,270
find a good lawyer to defend their case

65
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:46,130
assist in<font color="#E5E5E5"> paying legal fees and then</font>

66
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,270
also working together with the local

67
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:49,010
lawyer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> make sure that they have</font>

68
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,470
everything they need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up a proper</font>

69
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:53,810
defense in<font color="#CCCCCC"> addition</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to that we also</font>

70
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,820
engage in strategic litigation so that's

71
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:58,489
litigation at<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of the international</font>

72
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:00,710
level in which you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not only the</font>

73
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:03,740
outcome in a concrete case is important

74
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,570
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a more overarching goal one</font>

75
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:08,630
that could for example leads to a change

76
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,490
in legislation in a country and would

77
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:13,520
basically improve the situation for not

78
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:15,230
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the individual</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that is engaged</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

79
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:24,050
the particular proceedings but also

others thank you well we'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving</font>

transfer agreement successfully in front

of the European Court of Justice and

90
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:52,310
he's also challenging facebook on basis

of a class action in<font color="#CCCCCC"> Austria we'll hear</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">more about your experience on that</font>

93
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,570
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> use this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one okay um thanks</font>

94
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:11,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">for the invitation first of all</font>

95
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:13,460
basically we had three cases are a

96
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,680
couple of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them were first round was an</font>

97
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,360
island against<font color="#CCCCCC"> facebook we were looking</font>

98
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,540
at what<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook is doing with the data</font>

99
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:22,490
like internally<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a consumer side that</font>

100
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:23,990
was not too successful because the Irish

101
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,550
Data Protection Commissioner was not too

102
00:10:23,990 --> 00:10:28,610
interested in intervening with the

103
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:32,120
investment<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens in Ireland and</font>

104
00:10:28,610 --> 00:10:33,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the second round we did was a challenge</font>

105
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:36,350
that went up to the European Court of

106
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,699
Justice on the safe harbor agreement on

107
00:10:36,350 --> 00:10:39,500
the European law you're not allowed to

108
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:41,240
send data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to another country unless</font>

109
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,290
there's proper data protection because

110
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:43,460
it wouldn't make sense of data

111
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,900
protection to Europe send it somewhere

112
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:47,450
else<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then it's not protect anymore</font>

113
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:50,060
and there is an agreement<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the US</font>

114
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:51,530
which was called safe harbor under which

115
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,329
pretty much all the big companies are

116
00:10:51,530 --> 00:10:55,850
sending data from the European Union to

117
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:59,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">the US and we have the situation after</font>

118
00:10:55,850 --> 00:11:02,120
the Snowden there's no disclosures that

119
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:04,099
Europe was outraged about all the mass

120
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:06,950
surveillance partly doing the same thing

121
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:08,450
itself but that's another story and it

122
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,670
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting to find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a way to</font>

123
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:12,260
actually get some movement because we

124
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:13,699
had angry letters from Urkel and we had

125
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,020
like all<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of political first</font>

126
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,090
but we knew<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is not going to</font>

127
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:19,310
lead to anything we had like

128
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:21,530
demonstrations policy work and that

129
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:23,660
whole deal and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing was</font>

130
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:26,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you were in in mass surveillance cases</font>

131
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,740
we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have a government that</font>

132
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,900
actually accesses the data but you also

133
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,300
have a private company that has to hope

134
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">to give you know to hand over all this</font>

135
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:35,959
information obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't have</font>

136
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:37,520
jurisdiction over the US government but

137
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:39,020
we do have jurisdiction over facebook

138
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:41,360
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook's main headquarter</font>

139
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:42,980
internationally was Nylund so anybody

140
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,950
outside of the US and<font color="#CCCCCC"> canada had a</font>

141
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,120
contract with the guys in ireland and

142
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,980
because there were subject to european

143
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,390
union jurisdiction we were able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

144
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,980
you're not allowed to send data<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

145
00:11:50,390 --> 00:11:54,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">US anymore if this is used for mass</font>

146
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:57,080
surveillance and we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want on that</font>

147
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:58,880
striking down the safe harbor agreement

148
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:00,410
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was a very interesting be case</font>

149
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,990
because we're really looking at a

150
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,310
specific way to charge it something

151
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,770
which we couldn't have otherwise

152
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:08,689
targeted foreign government is something

153
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:10,670
you can typically not target but their

154
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:12,170
interest in having commerce with the

155
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:13,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">european unit is something</font>

156
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,500
where you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually get some you know</font>

157
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:18,889
have something you can actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit on</font>

158
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,209
and will<font color="#E5E5E5"> you also have jurisdiction the</font>

159
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:23,450
third<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing we're doing right now is a</font>

160
00:12:20,209 --> 00:12:26,000
class action in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Austria so we had that's</font>

161
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,940
really on consumer privacy more against

162
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:30,949
facebook<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well and in this case we're</font>

163
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,510
asking for choking amount 500 euro per

164

observed privacy policies to whatever

167
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:41,060
and in this case we we needed people to

168
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:43,399
sign up to the class action under

169
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,349
<font color="#CCCCCC">Austrian law so we had a little</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page</font>

00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:46,810
where you could sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> up your claim and</font>

171
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:49,100
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to log in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with your Facebook</font>

172
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:52,339
things that it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was a login with Facebook</font>

173
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:54,380
thing and upload your passport and and

174
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:56,029
fill out forms and whatever and<font color="#E5E5E5"> took</font>

175
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:58,100
people on average 15 minutes to fill

176
00:12:56,029 --> 00:12:59,720
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and I thought we need to have a</font>

177
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,750
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousand people over the time</font>

178
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:04,670
after<font color="#CCCCCC"> six days we had 25,000</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people that</font>

179
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:05,899
signed up to it so we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> had to</font>

180
00:13:04,670 --> 00:13:08,689
shut<font color="#E5E5E5"> it down because there were too many</font>

181
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:09,980
people signing up to the thing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

182
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:12,380
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very interesting</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see how many</font>

183
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:15,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">people actually interested in doing</font>

184
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,970
something about it the whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> case was</font>

185
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,859
also financed by procedure financing

186
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:21,589
company so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a they get a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">20-percent chair if we win the case but</font>

188
00:13:21,589 --> 00:13:25,610
they also cover all the costs<font color="#E5E5E5"> if we lose</font>

189
00:13:23,029 --> 00:13:27,410
the case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was very interesting as</font>

190
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,329
well how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to finance stuff like that I</font>

191
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:32,360
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a couple of things to put</font>

192
00:13:29,329 --> 00:13:34,870
in at the beginning<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you max we're</font>

or participating in a civil trial is

207
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:18,620
equal to the punishment<font color="#CCCCCC"> in which you are</font>

paying a lawyer or you're compelled to

209
00:14:18,620 --> 00:14:25,420
attend code given this it made sense to

210
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,460
challenge the provision by itself

211
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:31,160
thankfully the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government the provision</font>

212
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:34,130
was being incredibly abused and used in

213
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:37,280
instances which could which could help

214
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:40,100
us paint a narrative in which we could

215
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:43,069
argue<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there is not an abuse in the</font>

216
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:46,460
exercise of the provision but abuse of

217
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:49,460
the but there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a abuse inherent in the</font>

218
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:53,330
provision itself and this happened when

219
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:55,880
two young girls were arrested one was

220
00:14:53,330 --> 00:14:59,930
Hindu<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other was Muslim and this is</font>

221
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:02,720
important<font color="#E5E5E5"> because it showed a narrative</font>

222
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:07,130
where people<font color="#E5E5E5"> from across religious</font>

223
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:09,230
groups were young girls who are well

224
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,950
educated who don't come from urban

225
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:15,250
centres but come from a smaller<font color="#CCCCCC"> city and</font>

226
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:17,870
it gave us<font color="#CCCCCC"> a springboard towards</font>

227
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:20,360
challenging the provision itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> Supreme</font>

00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">Court struck down the provision relying</font>

229
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:26,780
on constitutional doctrines which are

00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:28,310
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> up which are well contained under</font>

231
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:30,110
Indian law have been developed through

232
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,930
president through the process of starry

233
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:36,200
decisis over decades but the court does

234
00:15:32,930 --> 00:15:38,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">not apply it always there is a context</font>

235
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:40,550
which it requires there is a certain

236
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:42,890
level of urgency which needs to be shown

237
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">and I think this process is what is</font>

238
00:15:42,890 --> 00:15:48,819
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> nor missing from strategic</font>

239
00:15:45,290 --> 00:15:52,160
litigations in India where we can map a

240
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:56,030
for instance<font color="#E5E5E5"> what are the what is the</font>

241
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:58,040
trend in the Supreme<font color="#E5E5E5"> Court in striking</font>

242
00:15:56,030 --> 00:16:00,130
down provisions or even hearing appeals

243
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,959
with respect to certain civil rights

244
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:06,230
preceding three weeks prior<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

245
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:08,000
filing so we can probably map whether we

246
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:09,970
should file right now we<font color="#E5E5E5"> should hold off</font>

247
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,280
it's more episodic it's more ad hoc and

248
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:14,570
I think that's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> learning which has</font>

249
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:16,430
come through from this litigation

250
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:19,190
another thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's been</font>

251
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:21,770
mentioned on certain panels is that the

252
00:16:19,190 --> 00:16:24,230
when there's a confluence of interests

253
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:26,360
civil society industry as well as a

254
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:28,700
certain segment of government being

255
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">receptive to arguments change occurs and</font>

256
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:32,810
I think that also<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists in litigation</font>

257
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:35,719
once<font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a confluence of interest</font>

258
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:38,550
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> a pure civil society argument</font>

259
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,070
per se which is incredibly being

260
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:44,609
put under stress in India especially for

261
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:46,920
being activists or for being opposed to

262
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,740
conceptions of development when it's

263
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,380
also an industry interest which matches

264
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:55,769
with civil society<font color="#CCCCCC"> which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> matches with a</font>

265
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:58,050
larger development goals it works so

266
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:00,660
I'll end<font color="#E5E5E5"> it at this right now thank you</font>

267
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:04,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">thank you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apart I think we'll be moving</font>

268
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:06,990
to oath boo<font color="#CCCCCC"> mire and for the next</font>

269
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:08,599
intervention which is um interesting for

270
00:17:06,990 --> 00:17:11,189
that panel because we're looking at

271
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:13,349
lawyer so far that has<font color="#E5E5E5"> been experienced</font>

272
00:17:11,189 --> 00:17:16,050
and wolf is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> experienced church in</font>

273
00:17:13,349 --> 00:17:18,629
Germany and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's now starting with a GFF</font>

274
00:17:16,050 --> 00:17:22,409
a new project on litigation and that

275
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:24,449
would be a new way to discuss um why you

276
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually decided to enter into that</font>

277
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:29,120
movement of litigation and wire maybe

278
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:32,100
the elements that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had to consider in</font>

279
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,719
creating that project yeah thanks

280
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:37,559
Estelle for inviting me to<font color="#CCCCCC"> participate</font>

281
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,780
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> this panel because actually I don't</font>

282
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:42,240
see my role that much is somebody who

283
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:44,250
shares a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> experiences because our</font>

284
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:46,200
journey<font color="#E5E5E5"> has just started I see myself</font>

285
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:49,080
much more as a learner and I'm really

286
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">happy to to get to know what you are</font>

287
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,460
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> just to give you a little bit of</font>

288
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,730
insight of course there has been a court

289
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,590
cases in Europe and also in Germany when

290
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:00,270
it comes to digital freedoms but there

291
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,760
has not been something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you could</font>

292
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:05,580
honestly call strategic litigation

293
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:07,050
because there simply was no body no NGO

294
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:10,379
an organization that would undertake

295
00:18:07,050 --> 00:18:11,850
such litigation and when I when I study

296
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:15,030
in the u.s. I got to know the amazing

297
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:17,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">work that organizations like the ACLU or</font>

298
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:19,800
the eff<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and so I thought well we</font>

299
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:22,800
need to have something as strategic as

300
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:24,659
planned and also as effective back home

301
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:26,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">in Europe and in particular in Germany</font>

302
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:28,440
where I'm from and I'm so I started

303
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,780
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the NGOs that we have in</font>

304
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,580
there in the realms Angelus like Amnesty

305
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:35,700
International but also smaller German

306
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:37,320
ones like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> CCC might be well known</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

307
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,360
somebody like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hackers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> organizational</font>

308
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:41,790
chaos computer club and everybody said

309
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:44,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">well it's an amazing idea we do need</font>

310
00:18:41,790 --> 00:18:45,750
this but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the resources but</font>

311
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:48,540
we would like<font color="#CCCCCC"> to participate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

312
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:51,690
effort<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you go go ahead with it and so</font>

313
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:54,360
about a year ago you are not even<font color="#E5E5E5"> in sep</font>

314
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:56,580
2015 it feels like like a year ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

315
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,908
it's only<font color="#E5E5E5"> half a year we found it a new</font>

316
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:02,340
umbrella organization which<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

317
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:05,549
undertake exactly that so we have set up

318
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:07,678
<font color="#E5E5E5">an association and we have gathered the</font>

319
00:19:05,549 --> 00:19:09,809
first funding to bring a couple of cases

320
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:12,090
in the realm of digital civil rights

321
00:19:09,809 --> 00:19:14,039
because we haven't filed them I am not

322
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:16,709
really at liberty to share detail the

323
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,129
cases but what I can say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that at</font>

324
00:19:16,710 --> 00:19:23,330
least<font color="#E5E5E5"> two of them are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the realm of</font>

325
00:19:19,129 --> 00:19:27,539
digital civil rights as infringed by

326
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:30,509
government agencies something that is

327
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:35,070
closely in term interlinked with the NSA

328
00:19:30,509 --> 00:19:38,279
scandal and this is also a clue topic I

329
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,750
guess to talk about when<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> comes to why</font>

330
00:19:38,279 --> 00:19:41,879
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually need strategic litigation</font>

331
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:43,049
because I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know exactly how it</font>

332
00:19:41,879 --> 00:19:44,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">happens in the u.s. I have the</font>

333
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:48,840
impression that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it there is at least</font>

334
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:50,639
some change brought about by Congress as

335
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:53,668
a reaction to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA surveillance</font>

336
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:55,559
scandal but back home in Germany nothing

337
00:19:53,669 --> 00:19:57,779
of that of that kind is happening so

338
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,360
Parliament<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically ignoring the</font>

339
00:19:57,779 --> 00:20:03,200
civil liberty implications that the

340
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,209
surveillance agencies have and German

341
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:08,129
agencies are linked to this are involved

342
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:11,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">in it and but nobody's doing anything</font>

343
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:13,709
about it and so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> only the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> means</font>

344
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:18,360
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we might have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about change</font>

345
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:20,309
here is legal means we might have to to

346
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,289
remind government that there is

347
00:20:20,309 --> 00:20:23,820
something like privacy that there are

348
00:20:22,289 --> 00:20:27,120
civil rights constitutional rights

349
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:29,158
involved here and but but it appears

350
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:32,219
that only court cases might be a means

351
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,990
to remind government<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these rights and</font>

352
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,250
to bring about change at least in the

353
00:20:33,990 --> 00:20:38,460
long run so this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> what we are trying</font>

354
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:40,139
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do as a new organization that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is of</font>

course still learning still being

356
00:20:40,139 --> 00:20:44,250
constructed and it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very exciting</font>

370
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:14,700
if you're curious about litigation if

00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:16,830
you're thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about bringing cases if</font>

377
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:31,139
participate in this really interesting

378
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:33,029
session I provide a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">different perspective I'm not a</font>

00:21:33,029 --> 00:21:38,669
litigator my organization<font color="#E5E5E5"> is involved</font>

381
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,408
isn't involved in litigation I'm my

382
00:21:38,669 --> 00:21:43,259
organization is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the international</font>

383
00:21:40,409 --> 00:21:45,029
corporate accountability round table for

those<font color="#CCCCCC"> that don't know where a coalition</font>

385
00:21:45,029 --> 00:21:51,299
of approximately 40 human rights labor

386
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:53,899
environmental and development

387
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:56,759
organizations that work to create

388
00:21:53,899 --> 00:21:58,439
strengthen and defend policy and legal

389
00:21:56,759 --> 00:22:00,809
frameworks<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ensure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that businesses</font>

390
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:04,590
respect human rights in their global

391
00:22:00,809 --> 00:22:07,769
operations so as I<font color="#CCCCCC"> said I car which is</font>

392
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:10,978
our acronym isn't involved in litigation

393
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:13,649
but a number of our members<font color="#E5E5E5"> are and but</font>

394
00:22:10,979 --> 00:22:15,869
what we do in I car is look at how we

395
00:22:13,649 --> 00:22:20,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">can reduce some of the barriers to</font>

396
00:22:15,869 --> 00:22:24,509
effective remedy whether it's through

397
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:27,239
judicial or non-judicial mechanisms so

398
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:29,489
I've been invited here to speak<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some</font>

399
00:22:27,239 --> 00:22:32,729
<font color="#CCCCCC">of our work we've done on access to do</font>

400
00:22:29,489 --> 00:22:36,450
digital remedies in 2013 I car

401
00:22:32,729 --> 00:22:40,080
collaborated with two other coalition's

402
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:41,940
to launch a project that examined access

403
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,820
to judicial remedies for human rights

404
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:47,789
violations by trans trans national

405
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:50,668
businesses so this research involved a

406
00:22:47,789 --> 00:22:53,489
combination of desk based research in

407
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:57,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">addition</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to consoles consultations with</font>

408
00:22:53,489 --> 00:22:59,609
NGOs retired judges governments and also

409
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:03,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Public Interest lawyers and corporate</font>

410
00:22:59,609 --> 00:23:06,478
lawyers so the final report which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

411
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:08,460
available on our website identifies an

412
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:10,559
analysis and it analyzes the most

413
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:13,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">significant barriers to effective</font>

414
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,559
judicial remedy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US Canada and</font>

415
00:23:13,739 --> 00:23:19,019
across Europe and the reason these two

416
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,249
restrictions were examined is because

417
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:24,019
this is where the majority of

418
00:23:20,249 --> 00:23:29,220
transnational corporations are domiciled

419
00:23:24,019 --> 00:23:31,759
so I'll take<font color="#CCCCCC"> a few minutes to explain go</font>

420
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:35,009
through some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the findings there were</font>

421
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:37,830
30 plus recommendations in our<font color="#CCCCCC"> report</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

422
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:39,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll just stick to four key findings</font>

423
00:23:37,830 --> 00:23:43,289
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> found were common across all</font>

424
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:45,450
jurisdictions and because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they</font>

425
00:23:43,289 --> 00:23:49,070
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> implications for a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the work</font>

426
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:52,259
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> my co-panelists will speak to later</font>

427
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:54,779
so our major finding of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> report was</font>

428
00:23:52,259 --> 00:23:57,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">that two years after the unanimous</font>

429
00:23:54,779 --> 00:24:00,299
endorsement of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UN guiding principles</font>

430
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:02,519
on business and human rights states are

431
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:06,629
failing in their obligation to provide

432
00:24:02,519 --> 00:24:09,749
access<font color="#E5E5E5"> to effective judicial remedies</font>

433
00:24:06,629 --> 00:24:11,998
for victims of business to business

434
00:24:09,749 --> 00:24:16,139
related human rights violations that

435
00:24:11,999 --> 00:24:18,929
occur outside of outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

436
00:24:16,139 --> 00:24:21,119
government's territory so as I said

437
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:23,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">there were 30 plus recommendations but</font>

438
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:26,369
I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on four for the purposes</font>

439
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:28,619
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> discussion our first</font>

440
00:24:26,369 --> 00:24:31,019
recommendation was that states must

441
00:24:28,619 --> 00:24:33,418
ensure that controlling entities within

442
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:37,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">business enterprises have a legal duty</font>

443
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:40,830
with regard to all parts of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the business</font>

444
00:24:37,049 --> 00:24:43,110
enterprises for<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights impacts so</font>

445
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:45,570
this means that parent companies have a

446
00:24:43,110 --> 00:24:49,279
response a legal duty for human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

447
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:52,408
violations committed by its subsidiaries

448
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:55,200
while there are multiple obstacles to

449
00:24:52,409 --> 00:24:58,049
effective judicial remedy in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

450
00:24:55,200 --> 00:25:01,340
transnational context the complex

451
00:24:58,049 --> 00:25:04,799
corporate structure within the modern

452
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:07,740
that characterized modern business lies

453
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,619
at the heart of this challenge so

454
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:13,529
without legislation clarifying standards

455
00:25:10,619 --> 00:25:16,199
for parent company liability the twin

456
00:25:13,529 --> 00:25:19,049
concepts of separate legal personality

457
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:21,600
and also limited liability make it very

458
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:24,629
difficult for victims to assert that the

459
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,399
parent company bears responsibility for

460
00:25:24,629 --> 00:25:29,459
the human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights violations of its</font>

461
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:30,449
subsidiary so our report therefore

462
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,570
recommends that

463
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,180
days clearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> affirmed the legal duty of</font>

464
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,730
parent companies to exercise due

00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:41,070
diligence human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights due diligence as</font>

principles on business and human rights

468

by<font color="#E5E5E5"> ensuring that the subsidiary does not</font>

00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:54,030
whether indirectly or directly the

471
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,729
second recommendation that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we found was</font>

472
00:25:54,030 --> 00:26:00,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">common across all jurisdictions was the</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">issue of extraterritoriality</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> states must</font>

474

enable victims to victims of

475
00:26:04,470 --> 00:26:09,840
business-related human rights violations

476
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to bring a case in the home state of the</font>

477
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:17,070
business for those that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are familiar</font>

478
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:19,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the context of the u.s. you'll be</font>

479
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:24,389
very familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the cueball case</font>

480
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:26,899
which has limited which articulated a

481
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:29,280
presumption against extraterritoriality

482
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:32,610
restriction making it much<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

483
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,379
difficult for<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights victims to</font>

484
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:37,469
bring a case under the Alien Tort

485
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:41,690
Statute here in the US for abuses that

486
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:44,430
occurred outside of the US so the third

487
00:26:41,690 --> 00:26:47,460
recommendation that I'll touch upon is

488
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:51,300
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> states must enact legislation to</font>

489
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:53,490
limit or remove financial benefits sorry

490
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:55,950
financial barriers that prevent victims

491
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:57,930
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> bringing a case again this was a</font>

492
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:00,360
major barrier<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was seen across all</font>

493
00:26:57,930 --> 00:27:03,420
of jurisdictions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I'm sure my</font>

494
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:05,760
co-panelists will be very familiar<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

495
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:08,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">the fact that trans national human</font>

496
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,700
rights litigation can be extremely

497
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:14,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">expensive and costly and this situation</font>

498
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:18,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">is further exasperated by the</font>

499
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:21,300
inequalities between parties commonly

500
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:23,340
plaintiffs often belong to marginalized

501
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:27,000
groups and defendants come with a team

502
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:29,209
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> well resourced lawyers so but this</font>

503
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,340
disparity would be significantly

504
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:35,010
improved by reforms<font color="#CCCCCC"> to collective rejest</font>

505
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:37,110
system and also<font color="#CCCCCC"> to incorporating costs</font>

506
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:39,950
of proceedings in code by plaintiffs

507
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,879
into the ultimate finding of liability

508
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:44,470
so the last recommendation<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

509
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:48,130
wrapping up now the last recommendation

510
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,960
i'll just briefly touch upon and it's

511
00:27:48,130 --> 00:27:51,730
not directly relevant to this

512
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,010
conversation but<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wanted to raise it</font>

513
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:56,710
for completeness of our of our research

514
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:58,990
was that we recommended that states must

515
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,910
develop and enhance criminal laws to

516
00:27:58,990 --> 00:28:03,640
hold businesses accountable for their

517
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:05,350
involvement in human rights violations

518
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:09,370
that take place extra extra

519
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:12,879
territorially and give rise to give rise

520
00:28:09,370 --> 00:28:15,909
to a crime so to conclude our work

521
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:19,150
demonstrated that access to judicial

522
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:22,420
remedy remedy is to easily denied on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

523
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:26,740
basis of procedural and substantive and

524
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:29,380
practical grounds limiting our ability

525
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:33,820
to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> back the lawyers and also</font>

526
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:36,760
inhibiting the role of litigation in

527
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:38,919
providing active remedy to victims of

528
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,150
business-related human rights violations

529
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:44,650
thank you thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sir I think we know</font>

530
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:47,200
have a good stage to start the

531
00:28:44,650 --> 00:28:49,120
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> and please raise your hand if</font>

532
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,250
you want ask a<font color="#CCCCCC"> question I might be the</font>

533
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:54,219
first one to ask actually on this issue

534
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:56,530
of access to court basically I want to

535
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:57,850
ask the panelists and I know they enter

536
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:59,770
might vary depending on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jurisdiction</font>

537
00:28:57,850 --> 00:29:03,370
which is also interesting for the

538
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:06,370
transnational cases if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> were to</font>

539
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,530
consider litigation today either as an

540
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:11,830
individual or as an organization if you

541
00:29:08,530 --> 00:29:14,200
had top three recommendation of things

542
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:16,480
to do or maybe things not to do from

543
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,040
your experience or from what you think

544
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:20,290
what would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you recommend if somebody</font>

545
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:22,870
comes to you saying I have I want to

546
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:26,220
bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> a case similar to yours I want to</font>

547
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:33,040
participate i want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make that change</font>

548
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:36,520
anyone want to start<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm gonna try odd</font>

549
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:37,840
now we got three microphones<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

550
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:39,670
what's interesting what I got I get a

551
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of emails</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know this thing</font>

552
00:29:39,670 --> 00:29:42,670
worked at<font color="#E5E5E5"> you European Court of Justice</font>

553
00:29:40,810 --> 00:29:45,460
I have a case here don't you want to do

554
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:47,950
this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well the biggest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is to</font>

555
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:50,460
separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> from what you want politically</font>

556
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:52,930
and what you can possibly<font color="#E5E5E5"> get legally</font>

557
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:54,550
typically this often times does not go

558
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:55,930
together<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're a lot of things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

559
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:56,310
want politically that we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

560
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:58,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">get through</font>

561
00:29:56,310 --> 00:30:00,120
court cases and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the most</font>

562
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:02,219
important thing is do I actually have a

563
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:04,229
case is it stable is it something I just

564
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to raise with a cord or is it</font>

565
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:08,790
something I actually have a possibility

566
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:11,250
to win and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that's the kind of</font>

567
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:14,159
the first big thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I get a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

568
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:16,290
in practice if you have such a case that

569
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:18,780
could work it's a big issue of where do

570
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:20,730
you file especially if it's something

571
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:22,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's not a national law or</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something</font>

572
00:30:20,730 --> 00:30:24,660
where you have an opportunity especially

573
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,280
in private sector as we dated are you

574
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:27,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of what we did is we kind of went</font>

575
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:30,240
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the private sector to actually</font>

576
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,800
hit a government so it was like playing

577
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:34,200
around like basically we're targeting

578
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:36,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook and if Facebook has a problem</font>

579
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">to expert data or the whole industry has</font>

580
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:40,950
a problem to export data to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the US the</font>

581
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,050
US has a problem overall without even

582
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:44,430
being in<font color="#E5E5E5"> court with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> US so it's stuff</font>

583
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,830
like that way you can find different

584
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:48,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways of getting things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you couldn't</font>

585
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:52,470
get directly but you could get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around</font>

586
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:54,030
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> corner and by using that you can</font>

587
00:30:52,470 --> 00:30:56,040
also choose jurisdictions that are more

588
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,379
favorable from a money perspective from

589
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:59,250
costs especially in Europe to promise

590
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:02,310
that you gotta pay the other side's

591
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,900
class if you lose a case there's stuff

592
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:06,149
like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really depends on a lot</font>

593
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:08,040
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the jurisdictions also so em if you</font>

594
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:09,930
have connections to different

595
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,980
jurisdictions it's interesting to talk

596
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:13,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">to different lawyers what the</font>

597
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:15,090
opportunities are so for example we

598
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:17,220
filed an island where a procedure

599
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:18,720
financing deal like we did it in Austria

600
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:20,760
is not possible you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have another</font>

601
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:23,160
person<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can ensure you basically</font>

602
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:24,780
against the cost in Austria was possible

603
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,910
we take pay twenty percent of the

604
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:30,690
winning fees however we get all the

605
00:31:26,910 --> 00:31:32,250
costs back in our class action you can

606
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:34,800
look if you can for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example make a class</font>

607
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,650
action different jurisdictions that's a

608
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,820
big issue so especially if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

609
00:31:36,650 --> 00:31:40,500
minorities or groups that cannot afford

610
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:42,270
something class actions may be a

611
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:44,850
wonderful<font color="#CCCCCC"> tool in certain in certain</font>

612
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,770
ways so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's different things</font>

613
00:31:44,850 --> 00:31:49,740
that you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at and that that</font>

614
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:51,720
could be relevant the biggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem I</font>

615
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,950
see is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just really having solid cases</font>

616
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:54,810
because the worst<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that can</font>

617
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:57,390
possibly happen is losing a case and

618
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:58,800
backfiring at your cost which is

619
00:31:57,390 --> 00:32:02,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is very interesting</font>

620
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:05,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think as well just want a letter on to</font>

621
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:07,140
that right<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I think as you</font>

622
00:32:05,280 --> 00:32:08,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">rightfully pointed out it very much</font>

623
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,220
depends on which jurisdiction you're

624
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:11,408
looking at

625
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:14,350
and then there's an enormous<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference</font>

626
00:32:11,409 --> 00:32:15,940
between national<font color="#E5E5E5"> jurisdictions etc I</font>

627
00:32:14,350 --> 00:32:17,439
think the overarching question in the

628
00:32:15,940 --> 00:32:19,690
beginning is what do you want to achieve

629
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:21,789
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then you can determine whether or</font>

630
00:32:19,690 --> 00:32:23,980
not litigation actually is a useful tool

631
00:32:21,789 --> 00:32:25,900
in your toolbox because it will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> 12 in</font>

632
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,210
your toolbox if you want to indeed get

633
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:30,520
the political and result that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want</font>

634
00:32:28,210 --> 00:32:34,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">that has to be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> married to a good</font>

635
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:35,559
strategy as<font color="#CCCCCC"> regards advocacy a plan</font>

636
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,450
already as to where you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that you</font>

637
00:32:35,559 --> 00:32:39,220
can get the best results as regards

638
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:40,809
implementation and then you can

639
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,510
basically go down a whole checklist of

640
00:32:40,809 --> 00:32:46,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">know what are my risks etc and they're</font>

641
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">also um kind of practicing the question</font>

642
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:50,470
like sure setting a bad precedent is

643
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:53,559
nothing any<font color="#E5E5E5"> lawyer would ever want</font>

644
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:55,510
however<font color="#E5E5E5"> I also do organ</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no organizations</font>

645
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:58,059
that do advocacy who say<font color="#E5E5E5"> like listen</font>

646
00:32:55,510 --> 00:33:00,250
just filing a case<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if we know that</font>

647
00:32:58,059 --> 00:33:02,309
we can't win the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is already</font>

648
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:05,080
bad it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to get any worse</font>

649
00:33:02,309 --> 00:33:06,760
raising awareness for the case by means

650
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:08,740
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this litigation and thereby perhaps</font>

651
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:10,658
even underlining how bad the current

652
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:12,549
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> is is actually something we</font>

653
00:33:10,659 --> 00:33:13,929
can use to our advantage so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

654
00:33:12,549 --> 00:33:15,039
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to think about very</font>

655
00:33:13,929 --> 00:33:17,559
carefully and again that's on a

656
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:19,629
case-by-case basis I think whether or

657
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:23,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">not you know litigation is something you</font>

658
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:29,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go for thank you I don't</font>

659
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:31,840
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if anyone's want to react one thing</font>

660
00:33:29,530 --> 00:33:33,908
one thing in addition to this and I

661
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:38,168
<font color="#CCCCCC">think as a general case strategy it</font>

662
00:33:33,909 --> 00:33:41,940
works well<font color="#E5E5E5"> especially in law given the</font>

663
00:33:38,169 --> 00:33:44,620
structure of the profession is a

664
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:49,270
incredibly towards the appearance of

665
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:52,600
formality tradition is to hire the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right</font>

666
00:33:49,270 --> 00:33:55,418
lawyers these lawyers should be viewed

667
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:58,260
in the sense that they are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only</font>

668
00:33:55,419 --> 00:34:01,000
lawyers who especially for<font color="#E5E5E5"> India who</font>

669
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,610
only do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Public Interest</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> work or civil</font>

670
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,980
rights work but are successful

671
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:10,960
litigators who argued the largest

672
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:12,940
commercial claims and this works well it

673
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:18,699
shows a legitimacy to the underlying

674
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:21,668
claim as well and secondly it also

675
00:34:18,699 --> 00:34:22,810
decreases a level<font color="#E5E5E5"> of skepticism in the</font>

676
00:34:21,668 --> 00:34:27,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">mind of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the court</font>

677
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:31,120
add there is a the<font color="#CCCCCC"> coat</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is being moved</font>

678
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:34,660
quite visibly to effect a change which

679
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:37,690
may otherwise be required legislatively

680
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:40,589
so it decreases the amount of suspicion

681
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:43,150
with which the claim is viewed so

682
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,720
structuring the entire strategy as close

683
00:34:43,150 --> 00:34:49,270
to a commercial litigation is sometimes

684
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:51,699
beneficial as well and the second thing

685
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:56,170
which I already<font color="#E5E5E5"> touched upon was that</font>

686
00:34:51,699 --> 00:34:59,710
once one claim goes from a party which

687
00:34:56,170 --> 00:35:02,740
may be for instance a non-profit or a

688
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:05,280
civil rights group if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

689
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:09,810
interest groups which latch on to that

690
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's successful in firstly preventing</font>

691
00:35:09,810 --> 00:35:15,490
attacks which are ad hominem and

692
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:18,940
secondly building a larger credibility

693
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:21,310
to the relief which is requested itself

694
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:23,530
so if you can show businesses interested

695
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:25,210
in it women's rights is interest for

696
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,420
instance let's look at a petition in the

697
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">Supreme Court which is asking for</font>

698
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:34,090
pornography to be made illegal when it

699
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:37,510
is viewed right now in India pornography

700
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:40,470
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> illegal if it's distributed sold but</font>

701
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">not when it's viewed privately so</font>

702
00:35:40,470 --> 00:35:46,290
through a litigation a person is asking

703
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:50,980
the court to expand the criminal penalty

704
00:35:46,290 --> 00:35:52,450
here there is a opportunity for and the

705
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:54,760
basis of the claim is that viewing

706
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:57,069
pornography gives rise to violence

707
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:59,590
against women so there's an opportunity

708
00:35:57,070 --> 00:36:01,780
here for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> research based organization</font>

709
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:04,750
and there is research which exists to

710
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:07,240
show that there is no causal link there

711
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:09,040
may be a link but not a causal<font color="#CCCCCC"> link</font>

712
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:11,350
between pornography and violence against

713
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:13,450
women a woman's right a rights

714
00:36:11,350 --> 00:36:16,450
organization can come in here<font color="#E5E5E5"> and argue</font>

715
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:19,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">that women should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have autonomy to</font>

716
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:22,270
consume pornography as well it's not as

717
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,669
if only men consume it they may consume

718
00:36:22,270 --> 00:36:27,370
it overwhelmingly but it's not as if

719
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:29,770
women should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be denied a form of sexual</font>

720
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:32,350
autonomy and doing it will be a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

721
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:35,080
powerful argument the third can be a

722
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:36,400
pure civil rights objection on elements

723
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,529
of free speech if

724
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:41,200
match all three together it's very

725
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:49,810
powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if only one goes it can be</font>

726
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:51,700
discredited sure and just on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the only</font>

727
00:36:49,810 --> 00:36:53,860
issue of choosing the right lawyer just

728
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:56,169
the strategy that's a very clear one

729
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,930
that that sounds like<font color="#CCCCCC"> a solid one for</font>

730
00:36:56,170 --> 00:37:01,270
the Indian context right I just want to

731
00:36:58,930 --> 00:37:02,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">take this flag that again that's an</font>

732
00:37:01,270 --> 00:37:05,620

764
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:35,440
get the lawyer who would be sort of most

765
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:37,960
commercially sort of the biggest

766
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,210
litigator<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's litigated those cases</font>

767
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:42,760
what would what about funding I mean

768
00:38:40,210 --> 00:38:44,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">obviously what you want to have is that</font>

769
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,920
this litigate is going to cost a lot of

770
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">money how do you go about sort of you</font>

771
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,910
know how do you strategize about funding

772
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:59,500
I mean that's just something I've been

773
00:38:51,910 --> 00:39:01,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">very curious about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so several of these</font>

774
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:04,450
lawyers if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> convinced as to the</font>

775
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:06,940
overwhelming merit in the case and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

776
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:08,770
a small community of lawyers who

777
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:12,820
practice in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Supreme Court they</font>

778
00:39:08,770 --> 00:39:16,180
devote their time pro bono so but you

779
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:18,660
need to create a team you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the</font>

780
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,930
work assist them in all ways possible

781
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,200
ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they studied the case also</font>

782
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:28,299
prepare it<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 and eventually they'll</font>

783
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,120
they'll give<font color="#CCCCCC"> their time for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> free they'll</font>

784
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:35,500
appear for free it's not the issue<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

785
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:36,940
best commercial was do that in<font color="#CCCCCC"> India max</font>

786
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:39,580
reacting and then we have another

787
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:42,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">question can I possibly add to that what</font>

788
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:43,480
we did for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example is crowdfunding like</font>

789
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,610
the the case that went up to the

790
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:47,500
European Court of Justice um was a

791
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:49,690
crowdfunding thing was interesting

792
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,920
because we did our own system like a

793
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,810
friend<font color="#E5E5E5"> of mine program that actually</font>

794
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:55,060
where people would get the money back if

795
00:39:52,810 --> 00:39:57,700
<font color="#CCCCCC">we win the case so they could either say</font>

796
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:59,290
we donate it to a similar<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause or you</font>

797
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:00,580
get it back up two cases one because

798
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:03,880
obviously it's just the fun that you

799
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">need if you lose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> case and that was</font>

800
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:07,450
interesting because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> within two</font>

801
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:10,689
weeks or something we got 20,000 euros

802
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,980
in and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> even took down all the links</font>

803
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:14,770
after a while because there was too much

804
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:17,430
money coming in and we ended up having

805
00:40:14,770 --> 00:40:21,100
seventy thousand euros in in our account

806
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:24,669
as a as a thing so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> oftentimes if</font>

807
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,450
it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> public interest the average</font>

808
00:40:24,670 --> 00:40:28,030
donation

809
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:31,270
30 year olds<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not a lot but you can</font>

810
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:32,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">still got a decent amount the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pro bono</font>

811
00:40:31,270 --> 00:40:34,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">thing is really a national thing like in</font>

812
00:40:32,859 --> 00:40:35,950
Austria you have lawyers that do pro

813
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:38,440
bono in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ireland was impossible to get</font>

814
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:40,509
anybody doing pro bono however they did

815
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:42,609
for example no-win no-fee side<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

816
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,230
depends on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> situation but especially</font>

817
00:40:42,609 --> 00:40:45,790
if you have a good cost that is of a

818
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,210
public interest you often times after

819
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:51,400
media reporting about it if you have a

820
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:52,750
you know that was like if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a</font>

821
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:54,460
crowdfunding or something like that

822
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,900
thing it's interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> as well because</font>

823
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:57,940
it shows the support of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public and</font>

824
00:40:55,900 --> 00:41:00,609
it also makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> you independent from you</font>

know donators or foundations and and all

00:41:00,609 --> 00:41:05,529
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's something</font>

00:41:02,410 --> 00:41:07,629
that worked for us quite well<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think i</font>

often they just don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> money to</font>

874
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:47,940
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> with so what's the general</font>

875
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:50,940
approach find a good pro bono let me

876
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:55,410
first get back to Fanny's question about

877
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:57,030
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> notion of success I I find that a</font>

878
00:43:55,410 --> 00:44:00,750
very interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> question because we are</font>

879
00:43:57,030 --> 00:44:03,000
facing the issue at this<font color="#CCCCCC"> point that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

880
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:06,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">Europe in but in particular think in</font>

881
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:08,160
Germany there is no culture of strategic

882
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,760
litigation and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> people have a very</font>

883
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:13,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">limited idea of what success</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> means and</font>

884
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,720
we are very<font color="#E5E5E5"> often confronted with the</font>

885
00:44:13,049 --> 00:44:17,970
idea that success is only if you win<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

886
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,520
case out right so if the care if the

887
00:44:17,970 --> 00:44:23,490
court says exactly what you wanted it to

888
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:26,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">say but I think for successful strategic</font>

889
00:44:23,490 --> 00:44:28,290
litigation this is the ideal concept of

890
00:44:26,369 --> 00:44:30,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">course if you win outright but there are</font>

891
00:44:28,290 --> 00:44:32,609
smaller wins and they can also be<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

892
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:34,920
interesting and very important stepping

893
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:37,650
stones and I think this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is roughly what</font>

894
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,470
Nene appointed to earlier on for example

895
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:43,470
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can have we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can lose a case</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> only in</font>

896
00:44:40,470 --> 00:44:45,930
based on<font color="#E5E5E5"> particulars of the facts in</font>

897
00:44:43,470 --> 00:44:48,660
that case but the legal holding in the

898
00:44:45,930 --> 00:44:50,220
case can still be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> favorable to</font>

899
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:51,230
human rights for exam so the court might

900
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:53,810
say

901
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:56,300
something is a basic right but it just

902
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:58,490
doesn't apply in this case and this can

903
00:44:56,300 --> 00:45:00,410
be very interesting successfully because

904
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:02,479
then you know which would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a better</font>

905
00:45:00,410 --> 00:45:04,420
case in terms of facts<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you might</font>

906
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,400
bring as a next<font color="#E5E5E5"> case to win it outright</font>

907
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:11,119
and even if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> lose a case completely</font>

908
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:13,460
on a legal<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter if the law isn't made</font>

909
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,240
worse then at least you can still claim

910
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:20,000
this success in in the sense that the

911
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:22,040
court makes it completely crystal clear

912
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,619
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there is a problem here and then</font>

913
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:26,810
you can use that as as the case that you

914
00:45:24,619 --> 00:45:28,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">can scandalize and you can you can try</font>

915
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:31,549
to base an advocacy campaign on this

916
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:33,740
case and either the court or the courts

917
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:36,140
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> will find that it's illegal what's</font>

918
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:39,830
going on or at least we can say well

919
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:41,450
this is supposedly legal but citizens<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

920
00:45:39,830 --> 00:45:44,390
you really want this<font color="#CCCCCC"> to happen in your</font>

921
00:45:41,450 --> 00:45:47,450
name and then we can try to put pressure

922
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:49,310
on Parliament to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> about change on</font>

923
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:51,919
on a political level so I guess a

924
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:54,230
litigation and a policy and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Waka see</font>

925
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:56,570
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> always go together we just have</font>

926
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:58,190
these specific strategic situation back

927
00:45:56,570 --> 00:46:00,440
home that there are already a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

928
00:45:58,190 --> 00:46:03,350
NGOs in place that do policy and

929
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:05,300
advocacy work and so we can partner with

930
00:46:03,350 --> 00:46:07,339
that what you basically adds to their

931
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:09,080
toolbox is the strategic litigation tool

932
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">but we don't want to duplicate all the</font>

933
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:12,980
efforts and structures that are already

934
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:18,470
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> place we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just adding the specific</font>

935
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:21,260
tool which is bringing court cases thank

936
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:23,450
you and that those are all really

937
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,100
interesting considerations if you look

938
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,799
at strategic litigation of course the

939
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:29,089
question is what is strategic litigation

940
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:30,530
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's really interesting to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

941
00:46:29,090 --> 00:46:32,150
this is taking hold in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe more and</font>

942
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:34,220
more I'm on the project words of the

943
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:36,250
public interest litigation project in

944
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:37,910
the Netherlands we're also exploring

945
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:41,300
certificates aggression in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Dutch</font>

946
00:46:37,910 --> 00:46:43,220
context and at the moment I just<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

947
00:46:41,300 --> 00:46:44,540
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of take a little slightly step</font>

948
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:46,730
back and zoom out from just the

949
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:49,940
strategic litigation bit in<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer to</font>

950
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:51,320
your question and because I I'm not

951
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:52,940
going to refer only limited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that on</font>

952
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:55,460
the panel but I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also look</font>

953
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,280
at litigation as such as a tool in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

954
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:02,410
human rights to box right particularly

955
00:46:58,280 --> 00:47:05,039
in countries where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> cannot count on</font>

956
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:08,219
wonderfully impartial<font color="#CCCCCC"> cords and good</font>

957
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:09,569
judgments etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> I do think that there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

958
00:47:08,219 --> 00:47:11,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">really good argument to be made that</font>

959
00:47:09,569 --> 00:47:14,099
fighting<font color="#CCCCCC"> these illegals but legal</font>

960
00:47:11,309 --> 00:47:16,439
battles to begin with is of importance

961
00:47:14,099 --> 00:47:18,719
and as a fundamental importance in kind

962
00:47:16,439 --> 00:47:21,209
of at least pushing back the tide as

963
00:47:18,719 --> 00:47:23,339
much as you can basically not fighting

964
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:26,249
certain issues in court means giving

965
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:28,828
complete freely way to the powers that

966
00:47:26,249 --> 00:47:30,178
be to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever they want and and</font>

967
00:47:28,829 --> 00:47:31,949
that's that's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> argument that I've</font>

968
00:47:30,179 --> 00:47:33,959
upheld for a number<font color="#CCCCCC"> of countries that</font>

969
00:47:31,949 --> 00:47:35,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">we've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> worked in where we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> basically know</font>

970
00:47:33,959 --> 00:47:38,069
that we will never be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to actually</font>

971
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:39,449
win a case international courts you're

972
00:47:38,069 --> 00:47:41,038
lucky<font color="#CCCCCC"> then that you're in a Council of</font>

973
00:47:39,449 --> 00:47:43,169
Europe member states you can go to the

974
00:47:41,039 --> 00:47:46,229
European Court with the right cases and

975
00:47:43,169 --> 00:47:47,759
get justice there and hopefully set good

976
00:47:46,229 --> 00:47:50,609
presidents and that might scare the

977
00:47:47,759 --> 00:47:53,039
authorities a little bit but but yeah I

978
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:55,019
do think that litigation as such can

979
00:47:53,039 --> 00:48:02,130
also just be a tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> even if even if you</font>

980
00:47:55,019 --> 00:48:04,649
lose Sarah thank you I just wanted to

981
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:07,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of pick up on this idea of success</font>

982
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:09,809
and disappointing decisions i think you

983
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:12,118
know in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. in the business in</font>

984
00:48:09,809 --> 00:48:14,819
human rights context the cue ball

985
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:17,809
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> was really devastating for a</font>

986
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:21,749
lot of lawyers<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had been using the</font>

987
00:48:17,809 --> 00:48:25,019
Alien Tort Statute as a tool and I guess

988
00:48:21,749 --> 00:48:27,209
following that decision and this picks

989
00:48:25,019 --> 00:48:30,749
up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then collaborating</font>

990
00:48:27,209 --> 00:48:33,689
with advocates and policy organizations

991
00:48:30,749 --> 00:48:35,519
which mine is my organization then

992
00:48:33,689 --> 00:48:37,828
partnered with earth<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights</font>

993
00:48:35,519 --> 00:48:39,479
international which had conducted a lot

994
00:48:37,829 --> 00:48:41,669
of this litigation under the Alien Tort

995
00:48:39,479 --> 00:48:44,609
Statute and tried to find a silver

996
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:46,229
lining in the cue ball decision<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

997
00:48:44,609 --> 00:48:48,239
know what could be next steps for

998
00:48:46,229 --> 00:48:50,399
strategic litigation and we thought okay

999
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,199
well the federal level is<font color="#E5E5E5"> closed what</font>

1000
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:56,159
options are there at the state level and

1001
00:48:52,199 --> 00:48:59,849
since then we've actually introduced

1002
00:48:56,159 --> 00:49:03,059
legislation here in California to extend

1003
00:48:59,849 --> 00:49:05,400
the statute of limitations for<font color="#E5E5E5"> serious</font>

1004
00:49:03,059 --> 00:49:07,249
human rights towards from two to ten

1005
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">years and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do the same</font>

1006
00:49:07,249 --> 00:49:12,299
across other states in the u.s. to open

1007
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:14,579
the doors for then strategic litigation

1008
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:16,890
to take place at the state level since

1009
00:49:14,579 --> 00:49:19,100
adores has been shot for the moment at

1010
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:22,140
the federal level

1011
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:25,290
um one thing was unlike the good pro

1012
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:27,330
bono lawyers the hardest time i had was

1013
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,580
not necessarily find people that want to

1014
00:49:27,330 --> 00:49:31,620
do pro bono work but to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people that</font>

1015
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:33,540
actually know what they're doing like

1016
00:49:31,620 --> 00:49:36,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the good is the bigger part often times</font>

1017
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:39,060
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's incredibly frustrating if you</font>

1018
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,130

1019
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:43,380
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're doing so my experience</font>

1020
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:44,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">often times what was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that it's easy to</font>

1021
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:47,040
get people that<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to help you but</font>

1022
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:48,390
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not it's not necessarily people</font>

1023
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:50,040
that we know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing there</font>

1024
00:49:48,390 --> 00:49:52,799
they get especially in the political

1025
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:59,250
sphere to go get very enthusiastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1026
00:49:52,800 --> 00:50:02,090
oh yeah your best success story for

1027
00:49:59,250 --> 00:50:05,730
crowdfunding for the litigation for

1028
00:50:02,090 --> 00:50:08,160
defending the digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights basically I</font>

1029
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:10,320
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mean</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in our case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was obvious</font>

1030
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:12,569
because it was an obvious cost a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1031
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:14,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">people shared and I already got emails</font>

1032
00:50:12,570 --> 00:50:17,460
before hand saying if you need money let

1033
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:19,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">me know blah blah and that was because</font>

1034
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:21,630
it was a very public case you also could

1035
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:23,670
have kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> create a movement in a way</font>

1036
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:25,080
of we're now taking on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem we</font>

1037
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:27,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">gotta go to court and fight for this</font>

1038
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,590
 and that was like this thing where

1039
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:31,650
you actually got a lot of positive

1040
00:50:28,590 --> 00:50:33,000
feedback and because the issue was clear

1041
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:36,270
to a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people it's something that a</font>

1042
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:39,540
lot of people booked arm and you could

1043
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:41,640
kind of show a solution show not just

1044
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we have a lot of advocacy</font>

1045
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,240
debates where we all stayed on the panel

1046
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:48,000
and complain how bad the world is and

1047
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:49,680
then we go home<font color="#CCCCCC"> and drink a beer</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and in</font>

1048
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,240
this case we could kind of show this is

1049
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:52,529
you know this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to file</font>

1050
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,930
this is what we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to do and we</font>

1051
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:58,050
need X amount to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it and</font>

1052
00:50:54,930 --> 00:51:00,299
that kind of generated a positive kind

1053
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,940
of exit scenario after whole debate I

1054
00:51:00,300 --> 00:51:04,800
think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was possibly what what but</font>

1055
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:06,360
helped in my<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it was interesting as</font>

1056
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:08,160
well because you have this like little

1057
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:10,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">student going against a big company</font>

1058
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:13,589
which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of had this David versus</font>

1059
00:51:10,470 --> 00:51:16,740
Goliath to it which interestingly worked

1060
00:51:13,590 --> 00:51:18,270
incredibly good in Europe but<font color="#CCCCCC"> was reason</font>

1061
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,529
why for example in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. it wasn't</font>

1062
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,660
reported because it didn't take it

1063
00:51:19,530 --> 00:51:23,250
serious like there's no way student can

1064
00:51:21,660 --> 00:51:25,890
win against you know Facebook end and

1065
00:51:23,250 --> 00:51:27,900
the government<font color="#E5E5E5"> and stuff however in</font>

1066
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:30,750
Europe this kind of generated a myth a

1067
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:31,640
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> gotta help that guy think</font>

1068
00:51:30,750 --> 00:51:34,010
so

1069
00:51:31,640 --> 00:51:36,740
you in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end it's like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> opr you go tell</font>

1070
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:38,150
a story in in in my case the story was

1071
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:40,939
the story we didn't have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> create</font>

1072
00:51:38,150 --> 00:51:43,670
anything around it but that worked quite

1073
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:45,650
well and you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need that much like</font>

1074
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you have you know we had 20,000</font>

1075
00:51:45,650 --> 00:51:50,510
period 2,000 people donating 30 bucks

1076
00:51:47,990 --> 00:51:51,560
which gives you six sixty thousand<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1077
00:51:50,510 --> 00:51:56,150
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end and that was what we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> needed</font>

1078
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:58,220
basically you're just getting back

1079
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:01,700
really quickly to the question how to

1080
00:51:58,220 --> 00:52:02,959
find good lawyers as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Max pointed out</font>

1081
00:52:01,700 --> 00:52:04,339
there are many people who want to help

1082
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:08,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">but not all of them are necessarily</font>

1083
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:10,130
really help help but to really tell you

1084
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:12,200
need people<font color="#CCCCCC"> on board and this is</font>

1085
00:52:10,130 --> 00:52:15,500
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> the challenge that we are</font>

1086
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:18,890
currently facing it doesn't really help

1087
00:52:15,500 --> 00:52:20,360
you if you only have I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know people</font>

1088
00:52:18,890 --> 00:52:22,460
who are not lawyers on board who have

1089
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:25,940
great ideas<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then you need to find</font>

1090
00:52:22,460 --> 00:52:27,770
pro bono lawyers somewhere around that

1091
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:30,050
bring your case you but you what you

1092
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:31,970
want to aim for is having at least some

1093
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:35,210
legal staff on board because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

1094
00:52:31,970 --> 00:52:36,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really why eff and ACLU are so</font>

1095
00:52:35,210 --> 00:52:38,600
successful at least in the digital realm

1096
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:40,729
of this because that's the round that I

1097
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:43,520
know where can more or less judge I

1098
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:45,080
think this their questions to em the the

1099
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:46,730
key to success<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really that they have</font>

1100
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:47,810
a legal team they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are not necessarily</font>

1101
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:49,880
bringing all the cases themselves

1102
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:52,220
they're not necessarily riding all the

1103
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:54,740
briefs but they have at<font color="#CCCCCC"> least the</font>

1104
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:57,169
competence on board to really know what

1105
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:59,089
they should<font color="#CCCCCC"> be doing and I think if</font>

1106
00:52:57,170 --> 00:53:01,070
you're in an organization then it's a

1107
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:04,790
really really good idea to try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get at</font>

1108
00:53:01,070 --> 00:53:06,830
least some legal knowledge in house to

1109
00:53:04,790 --> 00:53:12,860
be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to communicate effectively with</font>

1110
00:53:06,830 --> 00:53:19,750
possible external litigators thank you

1111
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:19,750
we had a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> just here in here Mike</font>

1112
00:53:24,599 --> 00:53:29,559
thank you yeah he had a question about

1113
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:32,709
the crowdfunding I think that was a

1114
00:53:29,559 --> 00:53:34,630
really interesting strategy I'm just

1115
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:37,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">wondering if there was any complication</font>

1116
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:39,999
with respect to the applicable rules of

1117
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:43,749
professional conduct for example in New

1118
00:53:39,999 --> 00:53:47,468
York according to the rules of the bar I

1119
00:53:43,749 --> 00:53:48,879
mean there's certain parameters that you

1120
00:53:47,469 --> 00:53:51,939
<font color="#E5E5E5">have to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> follow for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> attorney advertising</font>

1121
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:53,439
and similar issues did anything like

1122
00:53:51,939 --> 00:53:55,839
<font color="#CCCCCC">that come up or was it sufficiently</font>

1123
00:53:53,439 --> 00:54:00,239
distinct in that you funded the

1124
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:00,239
plaintiff and not the lawyers directly

1125
00:54:00,479 --> 00:54:04,660
yeah we basically an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Oscar it's very</font>

1126
00:54:02,799 --> 00:54:06,069
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set up an NGO you just have to</font>

1127
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:08,469
sign a piece of paper and hand it in to

1128
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:10,269
the government and unless they turn it

1129
00:54:08,469 --> 00:54:11,739
down because you're finding a new Nazi

1130
00:54:10,269 --> 00:54:13,779
Party or something like that you're

1131
00:54:11,739 --> 00:54:16,599
automatically an NGO within two weeks so

1132
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:18,429
that's what we basically did the NGO has

1133
00:54:16,599 --> 00:54:21,880
its headquarter I'm on the sofa in<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

1134
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:24,699
living room and has a bank account at a

1135
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:27,249
bank and the NGO basically got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> money</font>

1136
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:28,959
so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was separated from myself it was</font>

1137
00:54:27,249 --> 00:54:30,308
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only for this one purpose I</font>

1138
00:54:28,959 --> 00:54:32,859
wouldn't be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take the money and</font>

1139
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:34,329
run or anything like that and they would

1140
00:54:32,859 --> 00:54:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">then have a contract with me as the</font>

1141
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:41,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">plaintiff to basically fund whenever the</font>

1142
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:44,078
money is out and so this was all kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1143
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:45,519
an<font color="#E5E5E5"> illegal order and enough in an island</font>

1144
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:47,650
there is something like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

1145
00:54:45,519 --> 00:54:50,649
cannot fund<font color="#E5E5E5"> other people's cases and</font>

1146
00:54:47,650 --> 00:54:52,630
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> was kind of mentioned once but it's</font>

1147
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:55,329
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very old launch wasn't too interested</font>

1148
00:54:52,630 --> 00:54:58,179
in it and Austrian<font color="#CCCCCC"> Lauda wouldn't be any</font>

1149
00:54:55,329 --> 00:55:00,699
problem at all so that's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a again</font>

1150
00:54:58,179 --> 00:55:03,279
a local law issue of how you can fund

1151
00:55:00,699 --> 00:55:05,349
the case or not in our<font color="#E5E5E5"> case it wasn't an</font>

1152
00:55:03,279 --> 00:55:09,009
issue another thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we did is an</font>

1153
00:55:05,349 --> 00:55:11,289
island there<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the legal costs are just</font>

1154
00:55:09,009 --> 00:55:13,989
insane what the lawyers are getting is

1155
00:55:11,289 --> 00:55:15,369
an insane amount of money so my lawyers

1156
00:55:13,989 --> 00:55:16,869
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> gonna get about two to three hundred</font>

1157
00:55:15,369 --> 00:55:18,159
thousand euros by the Irish Data

1158
00:55:16,869 --> 00:55:19,959

1160
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:24,489
I would have to pay<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other side</font>

1162
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:29,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting because an Irish court order</font>

for money wouldn't be they couldn't

1164
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:32,710
execute that in Austria so I was

1165
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:34,240
shielded in

1166
00:55:32,710 --> 00:55:35,890
that sense I mean I didn't tell anybody

1167
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,029
and I didn't walk<font color="#E5E5E5"> into court was like if</font>

money from me anyways but it wasn't

00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,920
safety net for myself to kind of sleep

1171
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:44,339
well at night I was like okay I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1195
00:56:29,589 --> 00:56:32,890
this cuz you know if he says no you

1198
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,700
like 99% sure he just wants to refer

order for a maximum of ten thousand

1201

1202
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:50,560
you know we got<font color="#E5E5E5"> like seven times as much</font>

1203
00:56:46,810 --> 00:56:52,089
donations then in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end the maximum he</font>

1204
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:54,220
could have been so that's a gamble as

1205
00:56:52,089 --> 00:56:55,869
well the tree depends on on your

1206

that this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the case to cite</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two in</font>

the UN Human Rights Council for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last</font>

few years to the UN forum on business

1257
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:28,460
and human rights because of the mentions

1258
00:59:27,009 --> 00:59:30,349
of human<font color="#E5E5E5"> rights defenders in</font>

UN guiding principles on business and

1260
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:37,190
human rights we can interject the case

1261
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:39,410
on environmental defenders because the

1262
00:59:37,190 --> 00:59:41,630
guiding principles mention human rights

1263
00:59:39,410 --> 00:59:43,790
defenders twice so environmental

1264
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,890
defenders are human<font color="#CCCCCC"> rights defenders</font>

1265
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:47,420
according to this case which is the

1266
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:51,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time in the world that that's ever</font>

been expressed in a legal setting thank

you<font color="#CCCCCC"> thank you I think we have immediate</font>

1269
00:59:55,369 --> 01:00:03,530
reaction to that probably hi I had a

1270
01:00:00,859 --> 01:00:04,848
question about you were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot</font>

1271
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:07,580
about bringing different lawyers

1272
01:00:04,849 --> 01:00:09,800
together to create a good litigation

1273
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:11,598
strategy so I had a question about what

1274
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:13,430
happens when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> different lawyers</font>

1275
01:00:11,599 --> 01:00:16,730
that have different strategic approaches

1276
01:00:13,430 --> 01:00:20,049
in terms of raising issues or in terms

1277
01:00:16,730 --> 01:00:22,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">of moving the policy or moving the</font>

1278
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:24,050
movement a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit forward could you</font>

1279
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:25,460
talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about the challenges</font>

1280
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:28,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've had if you've encountered</font>

1281
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:31,040
any of that in terms of working with

1282
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:33,980
other lawyers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have different</font>

1283
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,810
approaches in that regard especially

1284
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:37,310
when it's you have the same issue that

1285
01:00:35,810 --> 01:00:40,009
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight for the same</font>

1286
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:42,849
class action or the same type of clients

1287
01:00:40,010 --> 01:00:49,670
but you fundamentally might disagree on

1288
01:00:42,849 --> 01:00:52,220
strategy I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> apartment I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think to a</font>

1289
01:00:49,670 --> 01:00:56,930
large degree it's a determined by the

1290
01:00:52,220 --> 01:01:01,779
client eventually lawyers do have a

1291
01:00:56,930 --> 01:01:01,779
large degree of say in public

1292
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:08,700
you
