have during<font color="#E5E5E5"> the panel go there and</font>

4
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:47,440
so hi everybody thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so much for</font>

00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:50,890
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with us anywhere welcome to</font>

00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:54,160
come closer so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you were we are cozy and</font>

7
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:56,860
connected and that's the idea here it's

8
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,410
really connected the next billion and a

00:05:56,860 --> 00:06:01,480
half people global connect initiatives

10
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,060
initiative that started with<font color="#E5E5E5"> some heroes</font>

11
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:06,400
inside the US government and has spread

12
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:08,890
so far all over the world and is<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:12,039
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> become an interagency effort civil</font>

14
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:14,110
society from around the world has been

15
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,930
supporting this since sep tember last

16
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,990
year when it was lounged and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i think</font>

17
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,570
that even<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> all a lot of our</font>

18
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:24,220
differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> in other subject areas we do</font>

19
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,630
have in common<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we want to connect</font>

20
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">people and we want to connect that</font>

21
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:31,390
people well<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we want to ensure that</font>

22
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">when countries invest in other type of</font>

23
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:36,820
research infrastructure it actually

24
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:38,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">invest in I efficient way and bring</font>

25
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:42,070
connectivity so if you are digging a

26
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:44,650
hole to install electricity cables why

27
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:47,080
not put<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cables for internet and</font>

28
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:49,270
fiber optics etc so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think one of the</font>

29
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,550
core ideas here with the global connects

30
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:54,549
really to change the narrative not be

31
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:56,800
focused on this and then also particular

32
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,980
companies and individuals within

33
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,190
companies like<font color="#CCCCCC"> Mac Zuckerberg</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and on</font>

34
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:07,510
internet.org and free basics and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

35
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:09,640
there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a common ultimate agenda which</font>

36
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,460
i think is absolutely a development

37
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:14,320
imperative but at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same time there</font>

38
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:17,469
are different strategies in place and

39
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,150
the key kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of message</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that I wanted</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

40
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,590
convey in this panel and I'm sorry I'm

41
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:24,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">not going to be able to stay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

42
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:28,599
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> time is that connectivity is not</font>

43
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:30,430
enough the connectivity must be must

44
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,040
happen and must take<font color="#E5E5E5"> place within a</font>

45
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,800
rights framework because<font color="#E5E5E5"> what you</font>

46
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:38,770
ultimately can end up with is people

47
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,630
getting access to part of internet or

48
00:07:38,770 --> 00:07:44,880
people getting connected to an internet

49
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:49,090
that is censored monitored surveilled

50
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:51,390
throttled and even militarized and that

51
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:54,549
is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing that we want or need</font>

52
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:56,050
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that would be my just opening salvo</font>

53
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:57,520
I don't know if I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned the</font>

00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,530
organization<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm from access nada</font>

and extend the digital rights of users

00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,719
risk so we particularly<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

59
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:11,260
connectivity from the perspective of the

<font color="#E5E5E5">user and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> human</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> rights that they can</font>

a new to actually explain a little bit

68
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,760
what is the initiative where it is and

69
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,539
how far it has gone and what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> its</font>

75
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:57,339
people online by 2020 this is actually

76
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:59,110
an internationally agreed-upon goal it

77
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:01,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">was agreed upon at the ITU</font>

00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,900
connect 2020 resolution and as part of

80
00:09:03,490 --> 00:09:10,170
this initiative we're actually trying to

81
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:10,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">give effect to this aspiration we also</font>

82
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,710
we're also trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really look to see</font>

83
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:22,810
how the internet and showcase how the

84
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet is a way of achieving all the</font>

85
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:26,800
sustainable development goals that were

86
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:27,850
recently adopted and I think what I

87
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,160
wanted to do in the very beginning is

88
00:09:27,850 --> 00:09:32,530
just to set the stage<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge that</font>

89
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:34,839
we have before us the<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of</font>

90
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:36,569
internet usage is still in developed

91
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:39,400
countries something that we all know and

92
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:41,440
this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a stark kind of representation</font>

93
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,939
of the world today and<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet</font>

94
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,720
connectivity and you can see that Africa

95
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:49,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lagging far behind it this is no</font>

96
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:56,110
surprise to anybody in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

97
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:59,800
then you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go to the the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next slide you</font>

98
00:09:56,110 --> 00:10:01,930
can see the graph over time in terms of

99
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:04,630
despite growth how the digital divide is

100
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:06,010
persisting and so the top graphic<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

101
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:07,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">is of developing countries and you can</font>

102
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:09,040
see and imagine that

103
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:12,189
this adoption rate would probably

104
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,839
plateau around 80 85 the developing

105
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:16,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">countries</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are still lagging far behind</font>

106
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:20,860
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again as you look over time the</font>

107
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:23,050
digital<font color="#CCCCCC"> divide is not closing that is to</font>

108
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:25,330
say that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this gap is persisting and this</font>

109
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,589
is all<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on I to data and then just</font>

110
00:10:25,330 --> 00:10:29,380
think about the least developed

111
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:30,610
countries the Afghanistan's the other

112
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,640
countries<font color="#CCCCCC"> are in a lot of pain where</font>

113
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:35,140
they are even below this adoption rate

114
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,030
and then if you go to the next slide you

115
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,470
can see as part of the global connect

116
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:40,569
initiative we're really trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> also</font>

117
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,820
explain why we think some countries are

118
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:44,920
lagging like what is the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

119
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,900
they're falling behind one of course a

120
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:49,300
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of countries would flag is lack</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

121
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:50,890
funds for infrastructure the second one

122
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,050
is we would say minimal technical

123
00:10:50,890 --> 00:10:55,569
expertise corruption political

124
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:57,760
instability we're also saying restraints

125
00:10:55,570 --> 00:11:00,190
on free speech we're so we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

126
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">identify these problem areas as ways</font>

127
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:02,350
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know countries when they think</font>

128
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,330
about creating an enabling environment

129
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:08,380
for growth they should really focus on

130
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:10,090
these specific buckets the other thing

131
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:11,530
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to show is you know</font>

132
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:14,110
where are some where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> seeing progress</font>

133
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">where's what are really kind of the</font>

134
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:18,730
countries that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've kind of showcased a</font>

135
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:20,560
lot of growth in a fairly short amount

136
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:22,120
of time and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are not any</font>

137
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,829
surprise to people in this audience it's

138
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,360
like Colombia Costa Rica<font color="#E5E5E5"> Malaysia turkey</font>

139
00:11:23,830 --> 00:11:26,620
Peru and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> even in the least</font>

140
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">developed countries you're seeing quite</font>

141
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:29,500
a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of progress and they're eating</font>

142
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,479
there are a lot of themes that<font color="#CCCCCC"> emerged</font>

143
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">here in terms of their investment</font>

144
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,810
policies or competition policies there

this event in the spring bank fund and

a very strong international reaction to

to our meeting is you know of course

them we're gonna<font color="#E5E5E5"> be asking people to</font>

00:15:31,689 --> 00:15:36,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">kind of come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with commitments whether</font>

of the commitments that were exploring

259
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,498
with one organization is to actually

260
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:43,059
help us<font color="#E5E5E5"> track progress towards how many</font>

organizations like the international

myself have only been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on it for</font>

289
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:47,059
us in September and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that short</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount</font>

290
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:49,429
of time it's

291
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:52,189
really built a lot of support<font color="#E5E5E5"> from other</font>

292
00:16:49,429 --> 00:16:53,209
sovereign countries industry members and

294
00:16:53,209 --> 00:16:56,919
resonating this that there's a need to

00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:58,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">now really redouble efforts on</font>

296
00:16:56,919 --> 00:17:00,379
international connectivity and that the

helping us with some data research and

320
00:17:45,159 --> 00:17:50,450
then you know for us we really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

321
00:17:48,889 --> 00:17:52,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">get a clear emphasis that connectivity</font>

322
00:17:50,450 --> 00:17:54,499
is cross-cutting development priority

00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:55,879
and for all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the government's that are</font>

champion our cause and encourage other

328
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:05,869
one of the things that I'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> note is</font>

329
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:07,549
so I've just<font color="#E5E5E5"> done the high level event</font>

interested in attending and we're

336

342
00:18:29,929 --> 00:18:33,259
them by listening right to what are some

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,789
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems that they're facing in</font>

344
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:36,769
some of the hurdles and kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of then</font>

345
00:18:34,789 --> 00:18:39,110
bringing to bear the technical

communities expertise and willingness to

347
00:18:39,110 --> 00:18:43,340
help solve those challenges so with that

348
00:18:41,629 --> 00:18:45,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">all kind of i hope that provided a good</font>

00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:46,610
overview and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can always take much</font>

350
00:18:45,379 --> 00:18:49,119
structures you know you're talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

351
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:51,860
water energy and things of that nature

352
00:18:49,119 --> 00:18:56,408
and what we're looking to do is sort of

353
00:18:51,860 --> 00:18:58,679
bring in if you will the expertise of

354
00:18:56,409 --> 00:19:01,200
professionals technical people

355
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:03,600
we're working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in those spaces you know I</font>

356
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,970
sit in the I Triple E primarily in their

357
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,800
standards division so very familiar with

358
00:19:05,970 --> 00:19:09,750
consensus building and working on

359
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:13,169
technical procedures if you will and

360
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:15,840
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting even in that spear if</font>

361
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,210
you will you see the differences<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

362
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,250
people who are working in<font color="#E5E5E5"> technical</font>

00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,560
aspects in developing technologies in

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> power and energy sector versus the</font>

365
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:26,700
ITC sector and sometimes it's almost

366
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:28,350
like they speak a different language

367
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:30,210
they think differently there's different

368
00:19:28,350 --> 00:19:33,419
processes they have different knowledge

369
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:35,160
sets so it's in a way what<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're trying</font>

370
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:36,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">to also accomplish you know to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> manas</font>

371
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:40,170
point about trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> raise awareness</font>

372
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,219
not only among the finance ministers you

373
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,630
know as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you mentioned you know they're</font>

374
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,240
getting this invitation they're saying

375
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:46,560
wait a minute this must be an error it's

376
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:48,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">really the kind of change a little bit</font>

377
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:50,220
of a mindset around that and to try to

378
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:52,140
connect people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that traditionally aren't</font>

379
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:54,060
you know this sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of maybe thinking of</font>

380
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:56,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as top priority or sort of on top</font>

381
00:19:54,060 --> 00:20:00,720
of their their work agenda better way of

382
00:19:56,430 --> 00:20:02,340
saying it but also to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know sort of</font>

383
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">bring down those barriers and start</font>

384
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:06,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">having more open conversations I think</font>

385
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:07,830
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> the last 10</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years in particular you</font>

386
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:09,419
know with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet Governance space</font>

387
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:10,889
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> general and the connectivity</font>

388
00:20:09,420 --> 00:20:13,140
challenges that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have at our outer</font>

389
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,580
feet right now you know a tremendous

390
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:17,790
amount of work has been done over the

391
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,370
years and you know various communities

392
00:20:17,790 --> 00:20:22,760
of practice and communities coming

393
00:20:20,370 --> 00:20:25,830
together we have civil society technical

394
00:20:22,760 --> 00:20:27,720
government NGO but<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes I think</font>

395
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:29,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">what happen is they went through deep</font>

396
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:31,230
into their into their sector if you will

397
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,810
and I think we're at this really

398
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,820
critical turning point and a juncture

399
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:37,200
that it's time<font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind of come back up</font>

400
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,240
with all that expertise and that

401
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,910
knowledge that has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> built over the</font>

402
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:43,440
years of trying to address these

403
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,510
challenges and sort of bring it<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up</font>

404
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the surface and have a different type</font>

405
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,820
of exchange of information so with that

406
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:51,990
you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actively as many are you</font>

407
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:54,060
may or may not know<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a pretty large</font>

408
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:55,350
technical organization we have about

409
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">four hundred and sixty thousand members</font>

410
00:20:55,350 --> 00:21:00,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">and 160 countries around the world and</font>

411
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,200
what's interesting about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and makes it</font>

412
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:05,850
a little bit unique is that we have the

413
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:08,460
foundation of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the organization is this</font>

414
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:10,889
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 40-plus technical societies</font>

415
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,090
so we're in power and energy computer

416
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,000
communications

417
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:18,779
aerospace vehicular and all have pretty

418
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:20,070
deep verticals if you will into that but

419
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,510
when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at the connectivity</font>

420
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:22,500
challenges and where how we're trying to

421
00:21:21,510 --> 00:21:25,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">use different types of infrastructure</font>

422
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,450
and innovative solutions and how we need

423
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bring</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that expertise that deep</font>

424
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:32,490
expertise that sits in those different

425
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:34,080
industry domains or sectors to connect

426
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:36,029
that type of knowledge<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to cross</font>

427
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:37,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">pollinate that so maybe different</font>

428
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,909
sectors can learn from each other<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

429
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,279
then we can bring that<font color="#E5E5E5"> information into</font>

430
00:21:38,909 --> 00:21:43,590
the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nations that are having</font>

00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,820
challenges and that we can sort helping

432
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:46,830
educate and bring that building that

433
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:48,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">capacity for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that second point well it's</font>

434
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:49,740
a very different thing how people define

435
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:52,980
things and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> people approach</font>

436
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:54,750
challenges and problems you know some I

437
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:57,779
don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's meant intentionally but</font>

438
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:59,220
for their ways of<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing things and I</font>

439
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:00,659
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's critical that we sort of sort</font>

440
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:02,880
of having<font color="#E5E5E5"> a different dialogue and yes</font>

441
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:04,289
getting on the same page about you know

442
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,870
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> real challenge is here and how we</font>

443
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:08,760
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bring that technical different type</font>

444
00:22:06,870 --> 00:22:10,379
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tenel expertise into it so we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

445
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,610
look at the infrastructure we can look

446
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:13,320
at some innovative I mean there's

447
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:16,408
amazing things going on with satellites

448
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:20,610
and balloons and you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> even you know</font>

449
00:22:16,409 --> 00:22:21,870
what we're looking at mesh thank you for

450
00:22:20,610 --> 00:22:25,439
the word I should know that<font color="#CCCCCC"> very well</font>

451
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:28,080
later too um but you know it's how we

452
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,760
can sort of sort again the theme for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us</font>

453
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,870
at i triple e saw how we cross pollinate

454
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,360
and how we can beam that type of

455
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:35,129
expertise and looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it just on the</font>

456
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,320
bestest the technical side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it but you</font>

457
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:38,789
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as man who in Carolina so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how's</font>

458
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,950
we've been working on this you know you

459
00:22:38,789 --> 00:22:43,049
look at it also from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

460
00:22:40,950 --> 00:22:46,080
there's a policy aspect there's finance

461
00:22:43,049 --> 00:22:48,720
and investment aspects<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this so it's a</font>

462
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,879
really complicated matrix in a way and

463
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:52,200
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be easy but I think</font>

464
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,970
that's where we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the roll up our</font>

465
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:55,260
sleeves and and I Triple E we'd like to

466
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:56,460
take on a challenge so we were<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

467
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:58,020
supportive of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the global connect</font>

468
00:22:56,460 --> 00:23:00,630
initiative and looking to bring our

469
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:02,580
technical expertise into it thank you so

470
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:05,610
much carrion and that's extremely

471
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,500
necessary right on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this translation</font>

472
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:13,110
is extremely necessary but an even

473
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,659
legacy and of technical community that

474
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:17,760
in many countries were<font color="#CCCCCC"> where was the</font>

folks from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Technical Community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:31,170
part now are part of the wii but talking

480
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:32,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">about legacy I think our panel was the</font>

481
00:23:31,170 --> 00:23:34,050
first panel try to come with a

482

<font color="#E5E5E5">the obvious science and technology</font>

488
00:23:50,910 --> 00:23:55,800
policy which actually has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been blowing a</font>

489
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:58,260
lot of innovative people that are really

490
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,480
worried with connectivity so if you can

491
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,240
bring a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bitch was the White House</font>

492
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,000
perspective on these and<font color="#CCCCCC"> why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Obama has</font>

493
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,550
put these on highlight and we see this

494
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">in us we fly lifeline and other programs</font>

495
00:24:08,550 --> 00:24:12,540
so if you can speak to that would be

496
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,890
grating yeah and you mentioned first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

499
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:20,480
thank you to access now we're putting

500
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:23,100
this entire of amazing event together

501
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,510
yeah you mentioned lifeline a lot of our

502
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,810
work has focused on domestic

503
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:28,830
connectivity and so you know the reason

504
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:30,360
why is because you know it's our

505
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:32,600
taxpayer dollars at work we're putting a

506
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:35,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of our money into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> our own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people but</font>

507
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:38,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">this initiative isn't doesn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involve</font>

508
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,709
taxpayer money to at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> new taxpayer</font>

509
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:45,439
money that we're spending this is about

510
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:47,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">taking the partners we already have and</font>

511
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:49,470
mobilizing them and and directing them

512
00:24:47,670 --> 00:24:51,360
in a way that's productive and that'll

513
00:24:49,470 --> 00:24:54,210
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the most whether its investments</font>

514
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:58,649
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's financing whether it's I'm</font>

515
00:24:54,210 --> 00:25:01,080
just a band-aid money this is I think

516
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:03,150
the well the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> we look at it is</font>

517
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:05,070
there's you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology</font>

518
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:07,620
experts over here like here was saying

519
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:08,700
you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the finance people over</font>

520
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">here and you've got the government</font>

521
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,230
people over here and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they kind</font>

522
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,179
of speak publicly but they never

523
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:17,480
actually sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> down at a table and talk to</font>

524
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:20,730
each<font color="#E5E5E5"> other and and talk about you know</font>

525
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,700
what's what's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue here why can't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

526
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:25,830
the technical expert just drop bring up

527
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:27,750
a map and draw out where the fiber needs

528
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:30,540
to go or like where you know what I need

529
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:33,930
to do to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get last mile or or why the</font>

530
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,370
regulatory expert you know can't say

531
00:25:33,930 --> 00:25:36,780
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's why you can't do that but</font>

532
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,000
here's how we could work together

533
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:40,560
on this that sometimes that the

534
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">conversation happens but then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe the</font>

535
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:44,610
person who has<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money like is out of</font>

536
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:46,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">that conversation right so why don't we</font>

537
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,490
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> get everyone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> together right why</font>

538
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:49,650
don't you just start this community to

539
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,440
practice why don't we start having<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

540
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:53,400
more situational awareness and why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

541
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:57,030
we start having<font color="#CCCCCC"> these conversations</font>

542
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:58,490
because you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government you know</font>

543
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:00,990
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be the answer to this</font>

544
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,210
what the what the White House what the

545
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:06,390
State Department wants to do here is get

546
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:07,740
the right people at the table and and so

547
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:09,420
that's why we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need all of you we don't</font>

548
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,800
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to be us that solves this</font>

549
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:12,870
problem it's not going to be us that

550
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:14,850
brings a nice 1.5 billion people online

551
00:26:12,870 --> 00:26:16,350
it's all of you and it's it's all the

552
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:18,870
experts and that's all the people who

553
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:19,949
<font color="#CCCCCC">who care</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about this issue clearly you</font>

554
00:26:18,870 --> 00:26:22,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">guys care about this issue because you</font>

555
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:25,470
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now so let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hear your ideas</font>

556
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,200
that's this this was our idea was you

557
00:26:25,470 --> 00:26:30,960
know we want to take you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know we</font>

558
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:33,000
recently spent a lot of money<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> both</font>

559
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:34,440
financing you know we have the overseas

560
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:38,190
Private Investment Corporation which

561
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:40,260
finances projects abroad we have the US

562
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:43,560
aid which does a lot of development in

563
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:45,270
disaster relief but what we've been

564
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,860
doing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to those organizations</font>

565
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,930
and partnering with them working with

566
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:51,510
them to see you know what opportunities

567
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,830
there are to integrate connectivity into

568
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:53,700
the work they're already doing and we

569
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">found out there are a ton of</font>

570
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:58,140
opportunities and you know at this April

571
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,160
14 conference to overseas Private

572
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,750
Investment Corporation is going to

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:02,580
announce two or three really<font color="#E5E5E5"> major</font>

574
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:04,500
financing projects<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to bring</font>

575
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:07,649
you no more than<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 million people</font>

576
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,910
online and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was that was sort of</font>

577
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,430
what we're getting at and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

578
00:27:08,910 --> 00:27:14,850
where we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go with this so that's</font>

579
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:17,550
sort of where we're coming from thank

580
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:20,699
you so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and if I can provide</font>

581
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:23,220
quickly civil society perspective here

582
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,710
one thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is important that I've</font>

583
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:27,000
been noticing since<font color="#CCCCCC"> Pokemon public</font>

584
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:34,170
knowledge has been<font color="#CCCCCC"> involved in this work</font>

585
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:36,810
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a emptiness of civil society paying</font>

586
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:39,000
attention to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> multilateral banks and</font>

587
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:41,190
it's very interesting to do that because

588
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,950
the gender movement is there the

589
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,530
environmental movement's there but we

590
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:49,980
are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> there yet and we should be there</font>

591
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:50,620
because sitting and digging with those

592
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:53,350
guys

593
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:57,909
the word bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> they and I'm from religion</font>

594
00:27:53,350 --> 00:28:00,030
so I went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> IDB the the</font>

595
00:27:57,910 --> 00:28:05,500
lighting American Development Bank and

596
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:07,899
it's our<font color="#CCCCCC"> country's do look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up for these</font>

597
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:11,160
banks because at the end of the day they

598
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,960
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting millions of grants and loans</font>

599
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:16,720
to developing<font color="#CCCCCC"> countries to develop a</font>

600
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:19,720
series of projects and we have to ensure

601
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,020
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> when the grants are made there is a</font>

602
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:24,790
series of incentives that all the

603
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:27,760
considerations we consider here in the

604
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:30,309
right scone privacy by design human

605
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,679
rights etc etc are also taking to

606
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:36,010
consideration these grants when we are

607
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,380
also telling them sat down a fiber optic

608
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:40,629
cable to connect<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next billion so</font>

609
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:42,910
it's really interesting for us to start

610
00:28:40,630 --> 00:28:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">digging in these new organizations and</font>

611
00:28:42,910 --> 00:28:47,980
not I know we are few and we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

612
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,040
few resources and we already overwhelmed

613
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:53,590
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> UN and trade agreements and all the</font>

614
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,720
other venues we follow but it but at the

615
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:57,939
<font color="#CCCCCC">end of the day sometimes where the money</font>

616
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:01,330
the power it where is the money is the

617
00:28:57,940 --> 00:29:04,090
power and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> banks do have that power</font>

618
00:29:01,330 --> 00:29:07,270
to shape policies and best practices

619
00:29:04,090 --> 00:29:09,220
through the policy papers but also to

620
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,429
the grants and loans so I'm just

621
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:14,590
clarifying this and asking more

622
00:29:12,429 --> 00:29:16,270
attention from civil society of<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

623
00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:18,040
banks<font color="#E5E5E5"> are doing and get involved with</font>

624
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:20,230
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the banks already</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have civil</font>

625
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:23,409
society committees and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Liars on so just</font>

626
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:26,230
get involved with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

627
00:29:23,410 --> 00:29:28,570
actually would like to open up for

628
00:29:26,230 --> 00:29:30,400
questions and our conversation so if you

629
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:31,870
guys have anything to add and if you

630
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:35,880
guys have anything to comment please

631
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:35,879
feel free is really a conversational

632
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:49,630
thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok um hi my name is Chen AI Qi and</font>

633
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:52,480
I'm from research ICT africa-based in

634
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:56,200
Cape Town my question is with regards to

635
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:58,110
the perception<font color="#CCCCCC"> you receive when as an</font>

636
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,330
American organization funding these

637
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:03,189
project because I'm following on from

638
00:30:01,330 --> 00:30:05,530
what you're saying with civil society

639
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:07,990
has to play a role in ensuring what

640
00:30:05,530 --> 00:30:10,149
exactly banks are doing but what is the

641
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:13,420
perception that you receive some

642
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:16,150
countries welcome american aid coming

643
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:17,620
into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their and systems but what about</font>

644
00:30:16,150 --> 00:30:21,310
other countries that are quite reluctant

645
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:23,679
for example i come from zimbabwe and we

646
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:27,040
all know my dear president is not super

647
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:31,600
keen about America coming in more in

648
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:33,580
love with China so what<font color="#CCCCCC"> um what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problems</font>

649
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:39,040
you face and what are the solutions that

650
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:41,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">you have one of the reasons why we made</font>

651
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:44,080
this multilateral effort it was because

652
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,149
to answer that very question we don't

653
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">want this to be a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. initiative at all</font>

654
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:51,910
we want this to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be we want as many</font>

655
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:53,080
countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> as possible joining us we</font>

656
00:30:51,910 --> 00:30:56,020
wanted to get the conversation started

657
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:59,050
but but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now we have I</font>

658
00:30:56,020 --> 00:31:01,570
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> 37 countries on right now yeah and</font>

659
00:30:59,050 --> 00:31:05,980
you see all those groups but you know if

660
00:31:01,570 --> 00:31:07,540
it were<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to us would be 150 so you</font>

661
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:09,160
know that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of there is going to be</font>

662
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:12,220
that perception initially but I hope

663
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:13,810
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> after the these next couple of</font>

664
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:15,700
events and after a series of

665
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:19,419
conversations that we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get</font>

666
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:22,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">started and after a new heroes come up</font>

667
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,550
yes we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want people within all these</font>

668
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:26,379
governments to come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and say you know</font>

669
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:28,360
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something not just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Global</font>

670
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:29,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Connections connectivity you know this</font>

671
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:32,459
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> something we want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to support and</font>

672
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:35,260
prioritize then hopefully we can get

673
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,830
more countries<font color="#E5E5E5"> on board and hopefully we</font>

674
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:40,780
can you know take the u.s. global

675
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:44,260
collect initiative of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. out of</font>

676
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:46,990
that line yeah and just also<font color="#E5E5E5"> adding to</font>

677
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:48,879
that in terms of clarification the

678
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:50,650
funding that<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes and there was a word</font>

679
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:53,170
bank representative hearing the past

680
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:55,240
session but in- you correct me but the

681
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:58,420
fund that comes from one word<font color="#CCCCCC"> bad word</font>

682
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,460
bank and the various regional banks do

683
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:02,260
not come from us it might come from us

684
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,600
but come from<font color="#E5E5E5"> germany and from other</font>

685
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:07,330
banks and from other countries and then

686
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:09,760
they pull<font color="#E5E5E5"> the money and distribute under</font>

687
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,649
certain strategies so even this call

688
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:13,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I made get involved if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get</font>

689
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:16,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can maybe shape that</font>

690
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:20,050
strategy<font color="#E5E5E5"> or where the money is gonna</font>

691
00:32:16,750 --> 00:32:21,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">gocho so in that sense that's why it's</font>

692
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:23,290
so important<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have this much lateral</font>

693
00:32:21,430 --> 00:32:29,730
banks because they receive and they give

694
00:32:23,290 --> 00:32:29,730
money broadly comments or questions

695
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:40,210
force the question by chennai<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think we</font>

696
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:42,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">have the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> real gain oh yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mayland fung</font>

697
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,100
the people sent it internet i'm

698
00:32:42,340 --> 00:32:49,060
originally from<font color="#CCCCCC"> singapore I live</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font>

699
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:51,550
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last 30 years um I think we face</font>

700
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:55,480
a new era of potential digital

701
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:58,330
colonialism and that's actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's</font>

702
00:32:55,480 --> 00:33:01,810
underlying all this whole bite finance

703
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:04,689
is just a disguise for that um I think

704
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:08,139
I'm very very curious<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the global</font>

705
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:10,240
connect initiative how we can take into

706
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:13,180
account the actual people and their own

707
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:16,510
voices and not just what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> think they</font>

708
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:18,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or do or the kinds of</font>

709
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:25,450
opportunities we think they should<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

710
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:28,990
so I invite you to respond I think one

711
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:33,790
of the most exciting<font color="#E5E5E5"> parts of or seeing</font>

712
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:37,270
is that stakeholders I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E the</font>

713
00:33:33,790 --> 00:33:40,149
World Bank are coming together<font color="#CCCCCC"> to put a</font>

714
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:45,100
day-long conference together on their

715
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:47,380
own to help bring in these voices and to

716
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:49,300
help shape the initiative<font color="#E5E5E5"> and to hear</font>

717
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:51,550
from local regulators from across the

718
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:54,490
world whether it's yeah Brazil Mexico

719
00:33:51,550 --> 00:33:57,580
all of them are invited and so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

720
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:01,570
you know a stakeholder driven effort to

721
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:03,010
help support<font color="#E5E5E5"> the Secretary of State who</font>

722
00:34:01,570 --> 00:34:04,659
will have a high level<font color="#E5E5E5"> event the next</font>

723
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:08,320
day with the various finance ministers

724
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:12,700
and for a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of us</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> here that has to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

725
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">really inspiring it is for me when I see</font>

726
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:17,949
that we basically have a number of kind

727
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,409
of cross-industry international plate

728
00:34:17,949 --> 00:34:22,509
people coming to Washington to kind of

729
00:34:20,409 --> 00:34:24,909
engage in a multi-stakeholder discussion

730
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:28,120
that's very inclusive to kind of talk

731
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:30,639
not only very new right this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> all kind</font>

732
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,668
of a new a new organic thing that

733
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,859
and I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> just happening on its own I</font>

734
00:34:32,668 --> 00:34:40,899
think for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us we're excited to play a</font>

735
00:34:35,859 --> 00:34:42,129
role and excited<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support and what</font>

736
00:34:40,899 --> 00:34:44,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">Meili is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> saying is absolutely critical</font>

737
00:34:42,129 --> 00:34:47,558
that we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very responsive to other</font>

738
00:34:44,589 --> 00:34:51,250
voices and other<font color="#E5E5E5"> ideas and really also</font>

739
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:54,510
talking about inclusion and the benefits

740
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:56,440
of connectivity and local challenges

741
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:58,750
which i think is going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be critical</font>

742
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:02,859
for the success<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this initiative and</font>

743
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:04,750
other initiatives like it yeah I could

744
00:35:02,859 --> 00:35:07,119
just add I totally agree i think you

745
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:10,779
know getting<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local community and the</font>

746
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,549
regional perspectives and challenges and

747
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:14,410
sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bottom-up approach that is</font>

748
00:35:12,549 --> 00:35:16,390
really critical and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know that's</font>

749
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:19,000
where organizations like I<font color="#CCCCCC"> Triple E kind</font>

750
00:35:16,390 --> 00:35:22,690
of come in in a way being a<font color="#E5E5E5"> global</font>

751
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:25,660
organization with a very deep and broad

752
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:28,480
geographic reach we have many many

753
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:30,460
technical chapters if you will all

754
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,500
around the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know the</font>

the terms that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of thrown</font>

758
00:35:35,799 --> 00:35:38,799
around a little bit as sort of

761
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of leverage organizations like I</font>

know get utilize those local communities

765
00:35:50,289 --> 00:35:54,309
to hear the challenges first and work

766
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:56,500
with the local communities and really

767
00:35:54,309 --> 00:35:58,930
have boots on the ground if you will in

768
00:35:56,500 --> 00:36:00,670
those parts of the world so that we get

769
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:03,220
that and it sort of comes up bottom up

770
00:36:00,670 --> 00:36:06,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we're also you're looking at it as a</font>

00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:55,319
involving the community to be a way I

00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,260
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to educate them inform them and</font>

787
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:02,250
make them participants to understand

788
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:05,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">really how the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> internet is structured</font>

789
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:07,770
the policies<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are implemented how</font>

790
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:09,960
they implemented<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how those can</font>

791
00:37:07,770 --> 00:37:12,810
directly affect their lives many people

792
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,420
are so removed<font color="#CCCCCC"> from that so we try to do</font>

793
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:17,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">that again at the bottoms you know</font>

794
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:19,740
bottoms up we are the boots on the

795
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:21,480
ground so to speak but my<font color="#E5E5E5"> question is</font>

796
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:22,919
how far when you talking about

797
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:26,850
stakeholders<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones you've mentioned</font>

798
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:29,010
so far our organizations and all that

799
00:37:26,850 --> 00:37:32,759
how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> it populate when you talk about</font>

800
00:37:29,010 --> 00:37:35,270
bottom up how does it populate our form

801
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:38,250
the people's views interest in all that

802
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:40,170
also because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i am actually in</font>

803
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:42,090
volunteering for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internal society</font>

804
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:44,430
I've seen how challenging it is when you

805
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:50,369
don't have resources to help you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

806
00:37:44,430 --> 00:37:52,529
that working so how do you do that I'm

807
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:53,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">glad you you know actually is a very</font>

808
00:37:52,530 --> 00:37:57,000
positive relationship a great

809
00:37:53,910 --> 00:37:58,350
partnership with I saw and for those I'm

810
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:02,760
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the knows who</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I sock</font>

811
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:04,259
is but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're there are many</font>

812
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,119
good programs<font color="#CCCCCC"> are with education and</font>

813
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,950
actually we have partnered with I<font color="#CCCCCC"> saw</font>

814
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">con with equal wireless for communities</font>

815
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:10,859
aspect and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so more on a</font>

816
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:13,800
capacity-building side so that we can

817
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:16,619
educate local communities on you know

818
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:18,240
this isn't there's many solutions or

819
00:38:16,619 --> 00:38:20,460
potential solutions and options for

820
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:22,680
connectivity to say the least this is

821
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:25,140
where more on the wireless side of it

822
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:28,230
but you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's sort of you know you</font>

823
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:31,200
start with those types of partnerships

824
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:33,810
and working in you know communities and

825
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,669
hopefully you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you can you can scale</font>

826
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:36,990
out that knowledge and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can scale up</font>

827
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,369
that information<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what you're</font>

828
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,560
building and bring it into different

829
00:38:38,369 --> 00:38:43,230
different communities by all means<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

830
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:46,500
a huge challenge but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's sort of you</font>

831
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:48,270
know one success story at a time one you

832
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:50,190
know community<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time and again</font>

833
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:53,460
taking those lessons learned and being

834
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:54,960
able to take what works and apply that

835
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:57,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">in different regions of the world it</font>

836
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,870
does or you know also learn what didn't

837
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,810
work

838
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:02,970
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those lessons but I think</font>

839
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,529
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is more sort of local level and sort</font>

840
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:06,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">of bringing those types of programs into</font>

841
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:08,340
those local communities but it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

842
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:11,430
to require resources it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

843
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,560
require partnerships and and education

844
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:15,419
and capacity building and that's why I

845
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:17,220
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this initiative is so critical so</font>

846
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:20,310
that we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> start raising the awareness</font>

847
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,220
about those challenges among investors

848
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:25,140
and technologists in you know technical

849
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,430
communities and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned earlier</font>

850
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:28,500
sort of like everything that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've</font>

851
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:30,120
learned over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past so many years to</font>

852
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,770
sort of let's bubble that up take the

853
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,180
best and see what<font color="#E5E5E5"> works in different</font>

854
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:35,280
regions of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world I mean it's not</font>

855
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:36,930
going to be a one-size-fits-all sale

856
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:38,550
there are many many challenges different

857
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:42,690
policies different cultures it's all

858
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:44,430
contextual but you know the best thing

859
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:45,930
is we can get the<font color="#E5E5E5"> best practices</font>

860
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:48,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of that and build those communities</font>

861
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:50,160
of practice in and you know it is we're

862
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:51,390
excited about<font color="#E5E5E5"> being involvement but we</font>

863
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:54,000
know that we're standing sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

864
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:56,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">the little bit of them foot about ever</font>

865
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,380
sent away but it is sort of working in

866
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">that local capacity you know so it's</font>

867
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,430
sort of getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> the support and the</font>

868
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,430
drive from organizations that can help

869
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:06,690
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> support that from resources but</font>

870
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:09,149
also then working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> local communities</font>

871
00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:11,130
and organizations like I sock to you

872
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:13,380
know bring that kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> training in into</font>

873
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:17,970
the local communities and knowledge if

874
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:22,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">you will and and just a quick testimony</font>

875
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:24,330
to that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that the folks that you</font>

876
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:27,720
know when you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> Domino's in sequences</font>

877
00:40:24,330 --> 00:40:29,400
and started so while we have some years

878
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the US government that did start that</font>

879
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,720
know me know if domino effect we are all

880
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:35,520
pieces of that and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we all should</font>

881
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:38,459
be pieces<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that and why I'm saying</font>

882
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,259
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> because every time I come and where</font>

883
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,420
I give suggestions they listen and<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

884
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:45,750
it's possible they implement or they say

885
00:40:42,420 --> 00:40:48,000
why<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't you do that so that's what I'm</font>

886
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,920
bringing here because at the end of the

887
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,340
day we come from a variety of

888
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,020
communities right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd also do open</font>

889
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,650
education the open educational community

890
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:01,050
we bring a lot of anecdotes we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> stalin</font>

891
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:03,120
jizz in communities and you bring that

892
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:08,550
inspiration from bottom up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

893
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:11,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">bring demonstrations of what happened</font>

894
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:13,560
and what worked on the floor<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if you</font>

895
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,690
here has ideas and I hear them think

896
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:17,820
about open innovation and platforms for

897
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:20,220
challenge and challenges and things like

898
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:22,410
that let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> sum that that let's plug</font>

899
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:25,200
those things to the global connect

900
00:41:22,410 --> 00:41:28,350
because the possibility is open no I

901
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,060
heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> novela saying that herself so any</font>

902
00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:35,009
idea<font color="#E5E5E5"> to plug into this and collect this</font>

903
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:37,500
grassroots initiative is really

904
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:38,970
important because just by doing that we

905
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:45,620
going to learn the best practice from

906
00:41:38,970 --> 00:41:49,819
the ground any other comment or question

907
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:52,170
Gary hi I'm Gary<font color="#CCCCCC"> Garriott primitives I</font>

908
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,320
find this session you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know super</font>

909
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:57,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting partly because I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

910
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:59,220
there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> been a narrative out there for</font>

911
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:01,710
many<font color="#CCCCCC"> years that we don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to</font>

912
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:04,200
worry about connectivity because you

913
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:05,820
know there's millions and not billions

914
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,609
of mobile phones out there and you'll

915
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:10,710
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of take care of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> itself and I the</font>

916
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:14,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">graphs that you were showing that the</font>

917
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:18,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">digital divide is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is not closing sort of</font>

918
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,520
the lies that narrative I think but as

919
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:23,490
karen was speaking I and talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

920
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:25,650
the different pillars that the I Triple

921
00:42:23,490 --> 00:42:30,450
E works with including power engineering

922
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:35,760
it made me recall at least a couple of

923
00:42:30,450 --> 00:42:39,839
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when i was looking at pictures</font>

924
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:44,910
from space of the earth at night and you

925
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:47,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know Africa has few lights parts of Asia</font>

926
00:42:44,910 --> 00:42:50,250
and certainly Latin American my guess is

927
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:51,859
that it probably coincides even today

928
00:42:50,250 --> 00:42:55,110
pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the lack of</font>

929
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:57,120
connectivity so I'm wondering maybe from

930
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:59,100
the I<font color="#CCCCCC"> tripolis point of view or any of</font>

931
00:42:57,120 --> 00:43:02,750
you if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> could care to comment</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

932
00:42:59,100 --> 00:43:05,790
specific role that providing better and

933
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:08,490
more reliable and<font color="#E5E5E5"> affordable electrical</font>

934
00:43:05,790 --> 00:43:11,279
power might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to promote this whole</font>

935
00:43:08,490 --> 00:43:14,069
idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> of global connectivity thank you</font>

936
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:15,630
yeah that's definitely one<font color="#E5E5E5"> Aspen a very</font>

937
00:43:14,070 --> 00:43:17,910
critical aspect of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> because we can</font>

938
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:21,090
have you know we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> beat hours we can</font>

939
00:43:17,910 --> 00:43:22,740
put solutions devices which know people

940
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:25,200
will definitely reap the benefits from

941
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:27,450
but if they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a power</font>

942
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:28,980
no that's that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> challenge I know</font>

943
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:30,720
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work going on with</font>

944
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:32,730
smart grid are smarter grid or

945
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:34,560
intelligent grid and where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the world you</font>

946
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:36,450
live and how they refer to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that smart</font>

947
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:39,509
cities which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit broader</font>

948
00:43:36,450 --> 00:43:41,460
than that maybe a more advanced math and

949
00:43:39,510 --> 00:43:42,869
ICT type of perspective but the power

950
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:44,460
piece of it is really critical and

951
00:43:42,869 --> 00:43:48,660
actually we are starting to bring in

952
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:50,250
that and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about connecting no pun</font>

953
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,410
intended different types of communities

954
00:43:50,250 --> 00:43:54,270
is to bring the power sectors and then

955
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:57,328
the people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are working in power</font>

956
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:59,759
power generation transmission working in

957
00:43:57,329 --> 00:44:02,460
smart grid to see you know what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

958
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">do and how that it will help enable on</font>

959
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:09,300
activity you know it's probably it's

960
00:44:05,790 --> 00:44:11,640
been there sort of underlying all of

961
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,720
this but now<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's time to bring that to</font>

962
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,000
the forefront and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this</font>

963
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,790
conversation and<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get those power</font>

964
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:19,380
engineers and utilities into the mix of

965
00:44:17,790 --> 00:44:25,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> conversation I think it's really</font>

966
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:27,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">critical sure and Natalya if you would</font>

967
00:44:25,950 --> 00:44:30,149
also bring a<font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit your experience</font>

968
00:44:27,690 --> 00:44:31,800
on I<font color="#CCCCCC"> gbn broadband before you join</font>

969
00:44:30,150 --> 00:44:33,750
american university would be great to

970
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,510
hear little bits the investments of the

971
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:40,619
bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know you cannot speak from them</font>

972
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:42,869
for them but anyway so one more question

973
00:44:40,619 --> 00:44:45,990
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> leigh again with the internet</font>

974
00:44:42,869 --> 00:44:49,050
society chapter some cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> bay area and</font>

975
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:53,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet systems consortium the question</font>

976
00:44:49,050 --> 00:44:57,300
I have is are there any local projects

977
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:59,790
that are being done maybe because there

978
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:03,480
are some connectivity issues<font color="#CCCCCC"> too in the</font>

979
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:05,910
US are there any incubated projects

980
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,560
happening locally with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> initiative</font>

981
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:17,129
to maybe act as a a good example or

982
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:18,660
something like that my colleagues

983
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:20,040
probably can speak more to it it was

984
00:45:18,660 --> 00:45:23,040
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was a couple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> weeks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ago I</font>

985
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:24,720
was at South by Southwest people are

986
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,140
familiar with that big conference right

987
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:31,770
yeah great in austin<font color="#CCCCCC"> two great city um</font>

988
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:33,629
and i did follow more of the what they

989
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:35,099
call their government policy track this

990
00:45:33,630 --> 00:45:36,420
time you're coming from<font color="#E5E5E5"> i trouble you</font>

991
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:38,289
should sort of really<font color="#E5E5E5"> focus more on the</font>

994
00:45:40,839 --> 00:45:46,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting they did attend a panel to</font>

995
00:45:43,630 --> 00:45:48,849
your point about some examples of it was

996
00:45:46,390 --> 00:45:49,989
more on the broadband it was out what

997
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,209
might be going on in some particular

00:46:01,779 --> 00:46:05,199
someone from New York<font color="#E5E5E5"> City and you would</font>

1004
00:46:04,059 --> 00:46:06,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">think New York City</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> why would they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

00:46:05,199 --> 00:46:08,559
connectivity problems its new<font color="#E5E5E5"> york</font>

1006
00:46:06,519 --> 00:46:11,078
<font color="#E5E5E5">city's like one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the major cities of</font>

1007
00:46:08,559 --> 00:46:13,059
the world but when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think about the</font>

1008
00:46:11,079 --> 00:46:14,919
the concrete in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> infrastructure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1009
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:16,749
<font color="#E5E5E5">the old infrastructure it really is a</font>

1010
00:46:14,919 --> 00:46:18,819
challenge for them and then they have

1011
00:46:16,749 --> 00:46:19,899
some community still after still after

1012
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:22,599
so many years of the impact of

1013
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:23,919
superstorm sandy and knowing what

1014
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:25,509
happened<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only from a power</font>

1015
00:46:23,919 --> 00:46:28,209
perspective but you know power goes down

1016
00:46:25,509 --> 00:46:30,249
on activity goes down literally you know

1017
00:46:28,209 --> 00:46:31,899
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I live</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the east coast so I know</font>

1018
00:46:30,249 --> 00:46:33,759
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know nine days of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> no electricity</font>

1019
00:46:31,900 --> 00:46:36,880
that's no I'm living in New Jersey um

1020
00:46:33,759 --> 00:46:38,529
but it was really<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it was an</font>

1021
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:40,929
eye-opening experience for many city

1022
00:46:38,529 --> 00:46:43,359
planners and addressing these types of

1023
00:46:40,929 --> 00:46:45,189
issues so one<font color="#E5E5E5"> that really kind of caught</font>

1024
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:46,839
my attention was what was going on<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

1025
00:46:45,189 --> 00:46:48,609
her<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to kick off in New York to</font>

1026
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:50,169
address some of those challenges they

1027
00:46:48,609 --> 00:46:52,089
have massive amount of concrete they

1028
00:46:50,169 --> 00:46:53,859
have high buildings you know signals get

1029
00:46:52,089 --> 00:46:56,558
law and then they have areas that were

1030
00:46:53,859 --> 00:46:59,619
you know under sea level that during a

1031
00:46:56,559 --> 00:47:01,479
bad storm are just totally taken out so

1032
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:03,099
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know although in a developed</font>

1033
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:05,140
part of the world in a very major city

1034
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,089
of the world there are<font color="#E5E5E5"> lessons I think</font>

1035
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:09,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're doing there that can be</font>

1036
00:47:07,089 --> 00:47:10,929
applied maybe to some other regions of

1037
00:47:09,009 --> 00:47:13,689
the world so you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the more</font>

1038
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:16,209
<font color="#CCCCCC">we can learn</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about those types of of</font>

1039
00:47:13,689 --> 00:47:18,129
pilots and projects an initiative not

1040
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:19,779
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> in North America</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and around the</font>

1041
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,759
world the better that will be enough i

1042
00:47:19,779 --> 00:47:24,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">think one of our key kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of objectives</font>

1043
00:47:21,759 --> 00:47:25,689
along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with all this is let's sort of</font>

1044
00:47:24,219 --> 00:47:27,789
find out what's gone and going on there

1045
00:47:25,689 --> 00:47:29,589
so that we in around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the world in those</font>

1046
00:47:27,789 --> 00:47:30,969
type of the pilots and examples and

1047
00:47:29,589 --> 00:47:32,949
initiatives and what they're really

1048
00:47:30,969 --> 00:47:34,959
learning it was best practices thing

1049
00:47:32,949 --> 00:47:36,219
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can apply but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i said for me it</font>

1050
00:47:34,959 --> 00:47:37,569
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just sort of io family you never</font>

1051
00:47:36,219 --> 00:47:39,339
really thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> City having a</font>

1052
00:47:37,569 --> 00:47:40,839
conductivity problem you know and i

1053
00:47:39,339 --> 00:47:42,578
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another party like this</font>

1054
00:47:40,839 --> 00:47:45,369
awareness that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and what</font>

1055
00:47:42,579 --> 00:47:47,079
we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> learn from that and i just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1056
00:47:45,369 --> 00:47:49,869
to actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think that's one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1057
00:47:47,079 --> 00:47:51,119
biggest flags at the work of for public

1058
00:47:49,869 --> 00:47:53,549
knowledge nationally

1059
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:56,999
<font color="#CCCCCC">international part but public knowledge</font>

1060
00:47:53,549 --> 00:48:00,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually core work is exactly to support</font>

1061
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:01,558
infrastructure and access and we do a

1062
00:48:00,119 --> 00:48:03,450
lot of work<font color="#E5E5E5"> with african-american</font>

1063
00:48:01,559 --> 00:48:06,660
communities and rural communities the

1064
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:09,118
pockets in<font color="#E5E5E5"> us are surprising to me even</font>

1065
00:48:06,660 --> 00:48:11,069
coming from Brazil and I think we have

1066
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:13,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> commemorate that yesterday they have</font>

1067
00:48:11,069 --> 00:48:15,529
to see actually voted to adopt the order

1068
00:48:13,559 --> 00:48:18,119
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the first time a level allows</font>

1069
00:48:15,529 --> 00:48:20,069
low-income subscribers should use the

1070
00:48:18,119 --> 00:48:21,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">Lifeline subzi did you help them connect</font>

1071
00:48:20,069 --> 00:48:24,089
so even if there is infrastructure

1072
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:25,950
sometimes we they still cannot connect

1073
00:48:24,089 --> 00:48:28,349
right so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it's a great step in</font>

1074
00:48:25,950 --> 00:48:30,660
the connectivity direction and maybe

1075
00:48:28,349 --> 00:48:33,359
with that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there might be more market</font>

1076
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:35,670
incentives and estates incentives for

1077
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:38,609
the expansion of infrastructure so I

0 and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you may be being let down</font>

1084
00:48:51,930 --> 00:48:56,970
by your slideshow so if you've already

1085
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">address these concerns don't don't</font>

1086
00:48:56,970 --> 00:49:00,988
hesitate to<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell me so one of your</font>

1087
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:05,640
slides has four boxes on it and it talks

1088
00:49:00,989 --> 00:49:08,400
about various digital ambitions that you

1089
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:11,129
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this one here so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is great</font>

1090
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay but the World Bank just came out</font>

1091
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:16,170
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a report or digital dividends where</font>

1092
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:19,230
it says that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the digital dividend has to</font>

1093
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:21,779
be supplemented by the analog compliment

1094
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:24,150
which is good governance skills

1095
00:49:21,779 --> 00:49:27,869
development and good regulation and

1096
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:30,239
competition I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> seeing that analog</font>

1097
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:33,269
compliment here and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

1098
00:49:30,239 --> 00:49:35,190
very important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to encompass in</font>

1099
00:49:33,269 --> 00:49:36,328
your presentation I'm sure you've

1100
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:38,009
thought about it as a part of the

1101
00:49:36,329 --> 00:49:39,960
project but it certainly should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1102
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:42,989
and to the point that was raised earlier

1103
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:44,519
on one of the things that's clear when

1104
00:49:42,989 --> 00:49:45,930
you look at this presentation is that

1105
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:47,519
there's no<font color="#E5E5E5"> reference to</font>

1106
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:49,288
<font color="#E5E5E5">multi-stakeholder them there's no</font>

1107
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:50,910
reference to local community there's no

1108
00:49:49,289 --> 00:49:53,220
reference to what you need to be doing

1109
00:49:50,910 --> 00:49:55,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">on the ground in developing countries to</font>

1110
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:58,470
make this happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that's a</font>

1111
00:49:55,489 --> 00:50:00,180
should be a core part of this initiative

1112
00:49:58,470 --> 00:50:01,950
and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be reflected in that</font>

1113
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,200
presentation and it needs to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be talked</font>

1114
00:50:01,950 --> 00:50:04,779
up because right now it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not coming</font>

1115
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,879
across

1116
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:07,990
um and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

1117
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:10,780
other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really need to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1118
00:50:07,990 --> 00:50:12,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">addressed here I mean as a is this when</font>

1119
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:14,560
the Secretary of<font color="#E5E5E5"> State</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is meeting with</font>

1120
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:16,990
the finance ministers is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> new money</font>

1121
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:19,180
this old money is this redirected money

1122
00:50:16,990 --> 00:50:21,160
what exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> is coming out of this</font>

1123
00:50:19,180 --> 00:50:23,200
initiative and what's the goal from the

1124
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:24,850
kind of support and investment

1125
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,890
perspective so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are some</font>

1126
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:28,509
key questions here that aren't answered

1127
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:30,009
I'm sure you have the answers but

1128
00:50:28,510 --> 00:50:31,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're certainly not answered in your</font>

1129
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:37,840
presentation I think it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> good to</font>

1130
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:40,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">get more clarity on that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Thanks I think</font>

1131
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:43,120
there are excellent questions we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

1132
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:45,310
pleased to<font color="#CCCCCC"> tell you that the World Bank</font>

1133
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:48,850
is launching a digital development

1134
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:51,779
partnership to respond to the challenges

1135
00:50:48,850 --> 00:50:54,520
of the world of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Elmet report that will</font>

1136
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:57,910
help countries with those analog

1137
00:50:54,520 --> 00:51:01,870
compliments and it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> exciting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1138
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:03,940
see this multi-country program that is

1139
00:51:01,870 --> 00:51:06,640
focused on capacity building and policy

1140
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:09,370
development and it'll be a major subject

00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,400
they hope is that actually we set a

1186
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:05,110
series of progress checkers and those

1187
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:09,760
questions need to be part of those

1188
00:53:05,110 --> 00:53:12,040
progress checkers so join if I may I

1189

dimension that's missing here and and

1194
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:24,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">and how are those forces marshaled which</font>

1196
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,930
are we<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to take into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> account the</font>

1203
00:53:40,270 --> 00:53:43,000
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how the Internet is just</font>

1204
00:53:42,070 --> 00:53:43,860
as important<font color="#E5E5E5"> as traditional</font>

1205
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:46,540
infrastructure they should be

1206
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:48,760
prioritizing programs and projects and

1207
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,470
funding and financing and so to that

1208
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:53,170
regard the overseas Private Investment

1209
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:55,419
Corporation has already announced a 250

1210

million dollar loan<font color="#CCCCCC"> for Myanmar for</font>

1211
00:53:55,420 --> 00:54:00,340
2,500 satellite towers that will really

1212
00:53:58,120 --> 00:54:02,080
boost connectivity in one of the

1213
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,600
country's that's really fallen the most

1214
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:06,730
behind<font color="#CCCCCC"> oh the overseas Private</font>

1215
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,250
Investment Corporation is also and will

1216
00:54:06,730 --> 00:54:11,920
be as was alluded by by US government

1217
00:54:09,250 --> 00:54:14,590
colleague another major announcement of

1218
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:17,710
170 million in financing for another

1219
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:19,750
country that being India so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is new</font>

1220
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:21,400
financing money that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1221
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:22,870
make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a difference in connecting millions</font>

1222
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:25,240
of households and we're hope that it's a

1223
00:54:22,870 --> 00:54:26,770
model for other donor countries that are

1224
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,359
also partners with<font color="#E5E5E5"> us in the global</font>

1225
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:31,420
connect initiative whether it's the UK's

divid or osita or other kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Germany</font>

other

1228
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,578
and we're hoping to catalyze more donor

1229
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,169
money and attention behind this so we

1230
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:41,380
can help as many people get connected as

1231
00:54:38,170 --> 00:54:43,770
possible I just<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be sure give to</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Natalya but actually we have</font>

1233
00:54:43,770 --> 00:54:48,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">choo-choo-choo-choo then and there is</font>

1234
00:54:46,270 --> 00:54:53,550
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> session but ok not a lien then</font>

1235
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:55,960
quickly just to reply to your request

1236
00:54:53,550 --> 00:54:59,820
through my<font color="#CCCCCC"> experience of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the world bank</font>

1237
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:03,040
and ND bei<font color="#CCCCCC"> i could feel that well</font>

1238
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:05,650
development banks are a development

1239
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,839
agency and a bank at the same time so

1240
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:10,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually that's an advantage but also a</font>

1241
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:12,700
challenge in the sense that you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in</font>

1242
00:55:10,750 --> 00:55:17,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">the end of the day they they want to</font>

1243
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:19,598
have they want to foster development but

1244
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:23,169
in the end of the day they need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have</font>

1245
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,839
project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> loan so what actually I saw</font>

1246
00:55:23,170 --> 00:55:30,510
from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the projects like work is that</font>

1247
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:33,578
whenever in broadband ya whenever yeah

1248
00:55:30,510 --> 00:55:36,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">whenever it's aligned to the country's</font>

1249
00:55:33,579 --> 00:55:38,319
policy that actually makes a huge

1250
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:41,349
difference because if you try to create

1251
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">something new that's much harder but</font>

1252
00:55:41,349 --> 00:55:46,990
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you already have like some sort of</font>

1253
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:49,000
structure and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> country is already</font>

1254
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:51,490
looking for the type of things your look

1255
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:58,300
your you can provide<font color="#E5E5E5"> that actually makes</font>

1256
00:55:51,490 --> 00:56:01,689
it much easier hi I'm wallah casse me

1257

1260
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:15,339
questions the first one did we think

1261
00:56:09,430 --> 00:56:16,839
about the outreach of like people if we

1262
00:56:15,339 --> 00:56:19,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking about connectivity if</font>

1263
00:56:16,839 --> 00:56:21,910
everyone gets connected to internet you

1264
00:56:19,599 --> 00:56:24,099
know that Internet can be used for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1265
00:56:21,910 --> 00:56:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">good and it can be use it for the bat to</font>

1266
00:56:24,099 --> 00:56:30,670
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the MENA region Isis is</font>

1267

using this tool to recruit young people

1268
00:56:30,670 --> 00:56:39,520

of questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have to think</font>

1285
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:51,649
deeply about like the one that you

1286
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:54,470
raised about how we can encourage

1287
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,500
through this initiative the good we

1288

1289
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,760
these types of difficult questions we do

provide a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> stability in certain</font>

1297
00:58:13,670 --> 00:58:17,390
the benefit of connectivity in this but

1298
00:58:15,619 --> 00:58:20,180
but you are raising good questions that

1299
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:23,058
can only be answered with with dialogue

1300
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,740
and really kind of hard thinking and so

<font color="#E5E5E5">this is why we're excited about the 13th</font>
