00:17:11,589 --> 00:17:15,169
Ron can you just start by talking a

16
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:21,859
little bit about Citizen lab and about

17
00:17:15,170 --> 00:17:24,050
the work that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're doing there there</font>

it

24
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:41,960
so in terms of the Citizen lab is a

25
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:43,880
research group<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the University of</font>

26
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:46,430
Toronto that does research from a

27
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,710
mixed-methods perspective on information

28
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,770
controls by mixed methods I mean when

29
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:55,010
combined disciplines of<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer science</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering law area studies field</font>

research to do a<font color="#E5E5E5"> variety of research</font>

32
00:17:58,910 --> 00:18:03,220
projects basically from a civil society

33
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,390
perspective we're not an advocacy group

34
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:08,720
we're interested in approaching

35
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:13,030
questions from a human race perspective

36
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:16,160
and trying to produce reports that are

37
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:17,870
very rigorous and evidence-based that

38
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:20,360
help inform some of the debates that

39
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:23,780
we're all interested in here thank you

of crowd who already understands a lot

63
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,470
of what the problems are and what we

64
00:19:31,230 --> 00:19:37,860
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do to fix the challenge is how</font>

65
00:19:34,470 --> 00:19:42,210
do we expand our reach right a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

66
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:45,299
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> issues are not visible to you know</font>

00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:47,940
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mass of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> audience the larger</font>

68
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,679
portion of it and increasingly<font color="#E5E5E5"> we see</font>

69
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,950
governments that are trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prevent</font>

70
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:55,710
them from being able to so we see a lot

71
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:58,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of efforts including in countries like</font>

72
00:19:55,710 --> 00:20:01,169
Russia where they're actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font>

73
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:03,210
pretext of copyright protection and

74
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:05,250
things like that to pass new laws to

75
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:08,040
pass new regulations to create new fines

76
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:10,620
for discussing what they call the

77
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:13,740
propaganda of circumvention tools things

78
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:16,110
like VPNs<font color="#E5E5E5"> toward</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saurons award but what</font>

79
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:18,240
we're really talking about there is the

80
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:19,110
right of access the right to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

81
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,490
connect the<font color="#E5E5E5"> right to be able to</font>

82
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:25,678
associate the right to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

83
00:20:20,490 --> 00:20:28,950
discuss and wow this is a really

84
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:31,410
challenging time to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> living in in the</font>

85
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:33,809
context of these issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> because so many</font>

86
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,240
governments so many institutions so many

87
00:20:33,809 --> 00:20:38,220
corporations feel increasingly

88
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,010
threatened by our ability to understand

89
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,900
contextualize and communicate what these

90
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:45,120
new threats are the thing that really

91
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:46,260
gives me<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope it keeps me going the</font>

92
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,610
thing that gets me out of bed in the

93
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,980
mornings the fact that we have rooms

94
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:52,740
around the world filled with people like

95
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:55,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">you and I think because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that maybe</font>

96
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,360
maybe we can carve out a victory here

97
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:59,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">and there and ultimately leave behind</font>

98
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,389
more rights than we ourselves<font color="#CCCCCC"> inherit</font>

99
00:20:59,990 --> 00:21:04,830
thank you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> much for joining us both of</font>

00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,950
an audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> of activists journalists</font>

107
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,690
lawmakers policymakers kind of the

111
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:30,600
people a little bit about your own

112
00:21:28,259 --> 00:21:32,159
theories of change and what you're

113
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:33,240
working on right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now what you're excited</font>

114
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:37,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">about and what you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

accomplish ed do you want to go first

116
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:43,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll go first in the context of</font>

117
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:45,779
this you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know there's there are a number</font>

118
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:49,139
of different<font color="#E5E5E5"> levels that we can have</font>

119
00:21:45,779 --> 00:21:52,169
impact is people working on efforts to

120
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:54,269
<font color="#CCCCCC">change the status quo where we have</font>

121
00:21:52,169 --> 00:21:57,230
increasing levels of intervention of

122
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:59,970
interference of lawful or unlawful

123
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:02,850
activities and operations that begin to

124
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:05,700
sort of impinge or limit the boundaries

125
00:22:02,850 --> 00:22:07,019
of our rights and we see this<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the</font>

126
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,299
world with sort of hacking operations

127
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:12,480
that are targeted against journalists

128
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:15,179
against NGOs human rights organizations

129
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:19,139
I mean even people who some governments

130
00:22:15,179 --> 00:22:22,980
they could reasonably argue are radicals

131
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:24,719
or radicalize errs as they prefer but at

132
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">the same time these aren't individuals</font>

133
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:29,879
who are known or even suspected to be

134
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:32,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with violence or terrorism</font>

135
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:34,230
and once we<font color="#E5E5E5"> start going down that path</font>

136
00:22:32,039 --> 00:22:36,539
there's really a question of how do we

137
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:39,899
fix it how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop and how do we make</font>

138
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:43,230
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people can organize they can</font>

139
00:22:39,899 --> 00:22:44,850
communicate they can reach and in my

00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:48,539
work<font color="#E5E5E5"> at soar the freedom of press</font>

141
00:22:44,850 --> 00:22:50,969
foundation is increasingly becoming

142
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:52,889
technical because there are<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

143
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:55,769
are better positioned in policy circles

144
00:22:52,889 --> 00:22:58,168
in political circles to make arguments

145
00:22:55,769 --> 00:23:00,360
to change minds because I don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

146
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:02,820
background you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> in politics i'm an</font>

147
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,830
engineer but increasingly we're seeing

148
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:06,960
the technology even though it's being

149
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">used as a sword against the public in</font>

150
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:13,950
many different spheres it can<font color="#E5E5E5"> also be</font>

151
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:15,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">shield technology and our science more</font>

152
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:17,970
generally is increasingly becoming needs

153
00:23:15,629 --> 00:23:21,149
where we can enforce human rights

154
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:23,190
through new means beyond words across

155
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:24,299
jurisdictions because we have to

156
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:25,980
remember at the end of the day even<font color="#CCCCCC"> if</font>

157
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:28,559
we get sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of a renaissance of reform</font>

158
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,080
in the United States Germany France or

159
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:32,639
some other country that's not going to

160
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,020
help everybody else that's not gonna

161
00:23:32,639 --> 00:23:35,280
help people in China that's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

162
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:38,220
people in Iran that's not going to help

163
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,629
people in Yemen or Dubai or any of the

164
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:48,800
place and I think increasingly we have

165
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:52,200
to work very hard<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expand and create a</font>

166
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:56,879
nexus of<font color="#E5E5E5"> fusion sort of sense of</font>

167
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,560
critical mass of values of community or

168
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,660
reaching in and pulling people on a

169
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,610
cross-disciplinary since<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly the</font>

170
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,770
kind of work the Citizen lab is doing

171
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:07,709
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> frid impressed foundations now</font>

172
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:11,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">increasingly doing as well where we work</font>

173
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,980
in the same sort of multidisciplinary

174
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:18,990
approaches<font color="#E5E5E5"> serve across domains across</font>

175
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:20,460
boundaries that our adversaries are well

176
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,840
actually just picking up<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

177
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,270
asked you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what you were working on</font>

178
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:26,240
now we're passionate<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and I feel</font>

179
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:28,710
<font color="#CCCCCC">very strongly about the role of</font>

180
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:31,020
university based<font color="#CCCCCC"> evidence based research</font>

181
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the type that Citizen lab is doing</font>

182
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,750
and right now I feel so fortunate to be

183
00:24:34,530 --> 00:24:38,940
surrounded by such an extraordinary team

184
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,860
of people at the Citizen lab that I work

185
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:43,860
with every day<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them are back</font>

186
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,540
there and we're at a really good space

187
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:48,510
right now we know what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing and</font>

188
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:52,080
how we have a vision and what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

189
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:54,270
accomplish we see ourselves as part of a

190
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,149
growing community of university based

191
00:24:54,270 --> 00:24:59,610
and researchers that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on</font>

192
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:01,680
bringing evidence to questions of

193
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,479
information controls essentially as I

194
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:05,040
often say lifting the lid<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

195
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet whether that's through reverse</font>

196
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,220
engineering mobile applications to find

197
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,870
hidden security vulnerabilities maybe

198
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:15,090
that have been baked in at the request

199
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:16,979
of governments or doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

200
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:18,929
measurement techniques to identify the

201
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,840
vendors<font color="#CCCCCC"> of filtering or surveillance</font>

202
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:24,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">equipment in the early</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

203
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,470
Citizen lab the the inspiration for this

204
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,820
I've said this maybe once or twice<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

205
00:25:27,470 --> 00:25:31,860
you know I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually thinking about</font>

206
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:34,470
the methods that state intelligence

207
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:36,149
agencies use especially the combination

208
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:39,810
of technical intelligence and human

209
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:42,000
intelligence and as a student of this I

210
00:25:39,810 --> 00:25:44,580
thought you know why isn't that you

211
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,940
can't plagiarize those methods turn them

212
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,120
on their head to watch the Watchers<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

213
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:49,650
set

214
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,620
essentially a civil society

215
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:54,150
counterintelligence capacity and that

216
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:56,399
was really the inspiration for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

217
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,440
Citizen lab in the early days I had no

218
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,960
basis to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> that claim it was really</font>

219
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,940
unfounded hubris and I think actually

220
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:04,560
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe and my government took</font>

221
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,870
it too literally and they said who's the

222
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,600
crazy professor in<font color="#CCCCCC"> toronto's talking</font>

223
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:12,629
about setting up a<font color="#E5E5E5"> counterintelligence</font>

224
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,330
capacity personal society so I dropped

225
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">that language but effectively now what</font>

226
00:26:15,330 --> 00:26:20,760
what we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> created and what we are</font>

227
00:26:17,850 --> 00:26:22,800
part of with our partners many of<font color="#E5E5E5"> whom</font>

228
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:25,290
are here in this room<font color="#E5E5E5"> are cyber stewards</font>

229
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:27,060
network working with groups like Human

230
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:29,690
Rights Watch and Amnesty International

231
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:33,720
and others is part of a growing movement

232
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:36,150
that applies rigorous methods to bring

233
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,670
forward evidence to do shed light on

234
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:40,680
what's going on in areas that

235
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:42,510
governments and corporations don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

236
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,670
you poking into and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

237
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,980
research is essential to everything else

238
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:49,290
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're doing because you need the</font>

239
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:52,410
data you need the facts to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to</font>

240
00:26:49,290 --> 00:26:54,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">support the policy claims the advocacy</font>

241
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:57,090
the litigation that anyone is doing

242
00:26:54,290 --> 00:27:02,550
beyond<font color="#E5E5E5"> that to promote and protect human</font>

243
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:04,199
rights online so you both talked a

244
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,909
little bit about messaging and about how

245
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,650
to take what you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

246
00:27:05,910 --> 00:27:09,720
communicate it out and I'm just

247
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:12,000
interested in what<font color="#CCCCCC"> your strategies are</font>

248
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:14,490
they're very<font color="#CCCCCC"> different um the way you</font>

249
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,530
both approach things the strategies for

250
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:18,030
packaging the the materials that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

251
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:20,850
think are really important<font color="#E5E5E5"> to relevant</font>

252
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:22,530
and sending<font color="#E5E5E5"> them out into the audience I</font>

253
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:24,840
think one of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've seen</font>

254
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:27,629
is that there is an increasing divide

255
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,879
between people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who really understand</font>

256
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:32,570
technology and you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

257
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,850
implement the tools and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> techniques</font>

258
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:37,230
needed to protect<font color="#E5E5E5"> themselves and people</font>

259
00:27:35,850 --> 00:27:40,949
who maybe don't understand technology

260
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:43,530
and rely a lot on defaults and products

261
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">as they come out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the package and it</font>

262
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,770
becomes really important to educate

263
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:48,240
those people especially as we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

264
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:50,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> things like encryption mandates</font>

265
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:52,290
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> popping up all over the world</font>

266
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:54,810
that could actually make the defaults

267
00:27:52,290 --> 00:27:56,520
really insecure and so what do you think

268
00:27:54,810 --> 00:27:58,169
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you're as your messaging things</font>

269
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:00,330
that you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to people is</font>

270
00:27:58,170 --> 00:28:01,799
there any rules of the road that you go

271
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,629
by I know I know

272
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:07,230
word has has just<font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple Twitter</font>

273
00:28:03,629 --> 00:28:09,238
followers that pay attention to him and

274
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:14,039
and look and try to see what he has to

275
00:28:09,239 --> 00:28:15,629
say yeah Ron why don't we let you sort

276
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:18,710
of start<font color="#CCCCCC"> a conversation on this one</font>

277
00:28:15,629 --> 00:28:22,619
since I took the last one sure okay so

278
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:25,679
yeah we take the communication of our

279
00:28:22,619 --> 00:28:28,980
research very seriously at Citizen lab

280
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:30,840
and for every research project that

281
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:33,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're engaged in we have a multiple</font>

282
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:35,668
track effort so part of it is to make

283
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:38,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">sure whatever we're doing is peer</font>

284
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">reviewed and taken seriously in the</font>

285
00:28:38,129 --> 00:28:42,320
academic<font color="#CCCCCC"> pure community of which we're</font>

286
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,369
apart so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> make sure that we place</font>

287
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:46,619
refereed journal articles and

288
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:48,269
conferences and so on the reason we do

289
00:28:46,619 --> 00:28:51,629
that is if you if you don't have

290
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:53,909
legitimacy in that community then you

291
00:28:51,629 --> 00:28:56,369
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're the basis of your research</font>

292
00:28:53,909 --> 00:28:58,440
maybe question and so it's very

293
00:28:56,369 --> 00:29:00,928
important to target and communicate to

294
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,460
that particular audience but then you

we work a lot with journalists

so many journalists are now targeted by

00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:32,810
weird being kind of thrust into a

2013 does the NSA collect any type of

beyond that right how do we move to

00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:33,689
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think ultimately it comes down to</font>

understanding what your values are

protections that we do in the United

394

States because how do you develop your

395
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:48,070
faults right how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> determine what</font>

396
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,570
it is that you truly believe how do you

00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:52,480
determine what it is that you really

398
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:55,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to say if you can't even keep notes</font>

00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,910
safely if you can't have some private

space some space for<font color="#CCCCCC"> thoughts some space</font>

they're sort of compare its ending or

406
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:16,179
social movements and ultimately i think

407
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:17,800
we reach a point where we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to become</font>

comfortable we have to create a culture

where people are comfortable making

sanctity of their own private space and

412
00:34:25,710 --> 00:34:30,130
it's not that i would say i'm

<font color="#CCCCCC">wrist this was actually a mistake from</font>

420
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,790
the counterintelligence perspective but

421
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:47,350
I talked to my colleagues I said well

422
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,239

this this shows we're collecting more

intelligence on Americans or

425
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:56,889
communications on Americans in America

426
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,839
than we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are on Russians in Russia is</font>

this really supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be our division</font>

428
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:05,230
of labor and of course I would say yeah

429
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:06,609
you know that's kind of crazy but you

430
00:35:05,230 --> 00:35:08,320
know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's wrong maybe that's not</font>

431
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:11,500
right maybe the tools got a glitch<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it</font>

432
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,180
no but whether it is or isn't you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

what happens to people who say something

about that and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> true obviously there</font>

these perfect dynamics of circumstance

441
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:37,750
we need to constantly be pressuring

it's typical corruption whatever it is

to allow us<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> permit us or more</font>

447
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,600
directly to not be able to<font color="#CCCCCC"> stop us from</font>

448
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:58,990
finding out what the<font color="#CCCCCC"> truth of our world</font>

453
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:13,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">substance a little bit I think there are</font>

454
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,890
so many negative things happening right

00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">now so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many threats that were responding</font>

456
00:36:14,890 --> 00:36:20,680
to in fact right<font color="#E5E5E5"> now there's an</font>

457
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:23,650
emergency session that popped up on laws

00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:25,029

460
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:30,760
and so we had to pop up a whole new

461
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:32,800
session just to deal with that issue one

462
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:35,050
of the threats that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're facing is this</font>

those threats is in the United Kingdom

467
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,220
where the the investigatory powers bill

468
00:36:45,630 --> 00:36:50,980
and the associated documents actually

469
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,370
would allow the government to force

470
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:57,360
companies to insert malware through a

471
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:58,799
dates and that's a real big problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

trust on the internet and<font color="#E5E5E5"> trust of</font>

I know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do a lot of work on</font>

480
00:37:17,510 --> 00:37:24,090
government use of off-the-shelf products

481
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:25,920
and how they use those in order to

482
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:27,810
perpetuate some of these activities<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

483
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,190
there controls that should be in place

you know we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> walked a little</font>

489
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:42,230
does your calculus on this question

<font color="#E5E5E5">change a little bit with the fact that</font>

the FBI in the United<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States at</font>

least in different ways<font color="#CCCCCC"> that are not</font>

00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:55,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">expected so you have the national</font>

498
00:37:55,860 --> 00:38:03,090
it kind of filters down to the everyday

499

police as time<font color="#E5E5E5"> goes on yeah so that's a</font>

00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:09,600
you know sorry go ahead and no no please

501
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:11,730
we're going so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a big</font>

502
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,009
topic and obviously it's probably the

503
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:16,440
topic that's been talked about most at

504
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:18,690
this conference and leading up to it

505
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:21,300
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the FBI Apple issue it's been in</font>

506
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:24,120
the news and I think what we're dealing

507
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,040
with here is a fundamental<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem of</font>

508
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:28,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">Public Policy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> national security and</font>

509
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:30,660
civil<font color="#CCCCCC"> liberties and computer security</font>

510
00:38:28,830 --> 00:38:32,970
information security and different

511
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:35,069
perspectives of security and clash

512
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:37,709
between the<font color="#CCCCCC"> national security</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> paradigm</font>

513
00:38:35,070 --> 00:38:40,260
and a different paradigm that is

514
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,450
hopefully emerging where people think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

515
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:44,970
the security of users first and foremost

516
00:38:42,450 --> 00:38:47,549
in this undifferentiated network that we

517
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:50,100
call the internet that we all love and

518
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:53,490
hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep secure and open at the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> same</font>

519
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:56,100
time the problem of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course is that you</font>

520
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:58,410
have many agencies now in governments

521
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:01,710
that are<font color="#E5E5E5"> very well equipped many of whom</font>

522
00:38:58,410 --> 00:39:03,270
where these<font color="#E5E5E5"> dual hats on the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hand</font>

523
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:05,670
they're supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be helping secure</font>

524
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:06,930
ourselves and our networks but then

525
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:09,210
they're developing

526
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:11,419
capacities to undermine them to exploit

527
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:14,190
them to destroy them and degrade them

528
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:17,190
what worries<font color="#CCCCCC"> me most actually is what's</font>

529
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:19,589
coming down the horizon and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is why</font>

530
00:39:17,190 --> 00:39:21,900
we are particularly interested in

531
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:23,849
looking at consumer applications things

532
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:26,400
like mobile browsers in a market like

533
00:39:23,849 --> 00:39:28,650
China when you begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> peel</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> back the</font>

534
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,760
layers of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> technologies and you see</font>

535
00:39:28,650 --> 00:39:34,920
oh my god you know you have dozens<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

536
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:37,680
vulnerabilities that are throughout

537
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,859
these applications that hundreds of

538
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,290
millions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are depending on you</font>

539
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:45,779
know who needs a Trojan horse when you

540
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:47,400
can get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mobile application installed</font>

541
00:39:45,780 --> 00:39:49,559
that's insecure and you can push a

542
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:51,420
malicious software update like we

543
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:53,819
demonstrated you can essentially take

544
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:56,670
over the device track<font color="#E5E5E5"> people through</font>

545
00:39:53,819 --> 00:39:59,819
their device<font color="#E5E5E5"> IDs we live in this</font>

546
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,750
environment we're emitting now a digital

547
00:39:59,819 --> 00:40:04,980
exhaust constantly around us that

548
00:40:02,750 --> 00:40:09,240
governments and other threat actors are

549
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:12,240
able to exploit so that this is a major

550
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:17,279
public policy issue that involves very

551
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:20,390
complicated debates and questions that

552
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,780
cross domestic international

553
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:25,828
jurisdictions obviously my preference is

554
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,400
probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> just about everyone in this</font>

555
00:40:25,829 --> 00:40:33,230
room is that we need strong encryption

556
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:36,720
from throughout every aspect of the

557
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:38,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure to protect communications</font>

558
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:41,730
to protect our security but that's not

559
00:40:38,819 --> 00:40:48,839
the way the trend line is actually going

560
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:50,819
and it worries me greatly this is a

561
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:53,160
really complicated space and it's not

562
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:54,630
made easier by sort of the claims of

563
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:57,480
government I don't want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get too deep</font>

564
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:58,799
into the Apple versus<font color="#CCCCCC"> the eye thing</font>

565
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,140
because I'm sure it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> talked to</font>

566
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:03,450
death but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bottom line is you know</font>

567
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:05,190
technical experts knew from day one that

568
00:41:03,450 --> 00:41:07,859
there were alternative means of getting

569
00:41:05,190 --> 00:41:10,290
into this phone that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were not reliant</font>

570
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:12,000
upon Apple these were laboratory

571
00:41:10,290 --> 00:41:15,569
techniques that existed since you know

572
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,770
the 1990s there<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-established every</font>

575
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:22,270
could even prefer

576
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:24,640
these sort of attacks they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> done for</font>

577
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:27,670
beneficial purposes at Chinese markets

in less than you know 30<font color="#E5E5E5"> minutes where</font>

00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:31,930
they'll swap out sort of memory chips on

the most important companies in America

out from that right when we put set the

sort of the basic argument in context we

realized<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this really isn't about</font>

one particular from this is about this

third of this is ultimately an argument

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> authority it's about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> power and</font>

further down<font color="#CCCCCC"> that path it becomes clear</font>

598
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:17,560
this is actually an issue of basic

00:42:12,610 --> 00:42:20,560
Liberty does the public enjoy the same

600
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,590
right to privacy that we have in the

601
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:26,320
past are we still private citizens and

602
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:27,580
then public officials where the

603
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:30,370
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> knows very little about us</font>

but we know everything about them or are

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> dynamics of the modern day where we</font>

606
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:35,380
see greater and greater levels of

00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:36,790
classification we some common

608
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,650
politicians we're creating sort of

609
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:40,600
secret email servers to exempt

00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,310
themselves from public records laws and

their defense for doing this kind of

612
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,200
activity is saying well other

613

00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:58,870
that's what we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should be focusing on why</font>

619
00:42:56,530 --> 00:43:01,480
are we the public becoming disempowered

620
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:04,560
at the same time that governments around

we get to a point where protocols and

standards have to change the actual sort

actually change in a meaningful

fundamental way that applies to<font color="#E5E5E5"> everyone</font>

everywhere otherwise we're trying to

onesies twosies in this jurisdiction or

683
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:31,270
that jurisdiction where we're able to

684
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,100
carve out something for example privacy

685
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,509
laws in the United States we're one of

686

the only<font color="#E5E5E5"> Western democracies that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't have a basic consumer privacy</font>

688
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:43,049
wall we have a few sort of niches like a

689
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:45,610
HIPAA law in health we've got credit

690
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:46,160
privacy laws but we don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a general</font>

691
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,440
rules of the

00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,549
the go look you can't collect<font color="#E5E5E5"> this you</font>

693
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:52,700
can't share this you can't do anything

<font color="#CCCCCC">with this unless you're abiding by these</font>

695
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:56,990
basic rules and so there's no commercial

696
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:59,150
pressure there's no commercial impetus

697
00:45:56,990 --> 00:46:01,850
that make sure we think about these

698
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:04,600
things we're developing safe systems

699
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:07,400
from day one rather than designing

700
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:09,140
unsafe structures that aren't putting

701
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:11,960
individuals at risk they're putting

702
00:46:09,140 --> 00:46:14,060
society at risk and we're simply hoping

703
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,770
that no one will take advantage of the

704
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:19,580
sort of tragedy comes problem that we're

705
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:21,410
building<font color="#CCCCCC"> for ourselves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

706
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:23,450
the audience questions and the audience

707
00:46:21,410 --> 00:46:25,670
is really interested in what both<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you</font>

708
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:27,669
are doing next and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to take a</font>

709
00:46:25,670 --> 00:46:30,020
cue and I'm going to start with Edward

710
00:46:27,670 --> 00:46:32,000
because the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants to know what</font>

711
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:35,560
you think Citizen lab should be doing

712
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:38,600
next and so then I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to ask Ron</font>

713
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:41,029
what you think the next role is that

714
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:43,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">Edward should take on in his you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

715
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:45,170
post whistleblower he is now fairly

716
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:52,220
established capacity i gotta i gotta

717
00:46:45,170 --> 00:46:55,820
suggest<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok i'll start with the Citizen</font>

718
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:56,750
lab similar things the Citizen lab has

719

done in the past that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have had</font>

720
00:46:56,750 --> 00:47:02,180
incredibly high impact at least in the

00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:04,790
circles that ice will be traveling more

778
00:49:31,859 --> 00:49:38,520

<font color="#E5E5E5">very passionately in maybe in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bit of a</font>

of the university's system I it's

790
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:07,290
difficult because right now the

798
00:50:21,030 --> 00:50:25,440

00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:27,960
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us to do what we do and</font>

things recently that's happened I feel

it's just terrific are these fellowship

put them in other people's hands and

important responsibility and we took

00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:46,049
maybe an independent advisory board that

874
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:47,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">is set up that would adjudicate</font>

875
00:53:46,049 --> 00:53:50,509
applications from journalists and

876
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:54,299
researchers who want to responsibly

877
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:56,849
investigate the material and bring to

878
00:53:54,299 --> 00:53:59,520
light some other stories that simply one

879
00:53:56,849 --> 00:54:01,950
organization from a capacity perspective

880
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:05,430
isn't able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> deal with effectively so</font>

881
00:54:01,950 --> 00:54:08,399
I'm wondering if ed thinks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

882
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:10,348
status of the materials going into the

883
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,819
future and if I could<font color="#CCCCCC"> just piggyback a</font>

884
00:54:10,349 --> 00:54:14,250
question on to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and what advice</font>

885
00:54:11,819 --> 00:54:18,119
would you give to the next person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who is</font>

886
00:54:14,250 --> 00:54:20,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to follow your footsteps yeah i</font>

887
00:54:18,119 --> 00:54:22,140
mean this is this is a really important

888
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:24,390
space for discussion<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't think it</font>

889
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:25,710
gets enough there's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> big challenge</font>

890
00:54:24,390 --> 00:54:27,480
which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really call the</font>

891
00:54:25,710 --> 00:54:29,970
shots anymore because I no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

892
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:33,150
access to any other<font color="#CCCCCC"> material it is</font>

894
00:54:33,150 --> 00:54:36,119
say hey you know hear my thoughts but

895
00:54:34,529 --> 00:54:38,770
ultimately it's no longer my decision

896
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:40,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">and that's actually proper I think</font>

897
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,250
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want a single</font>

this countervailing argument that I

whoa that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is too hot for us and that's</font>

932
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:16,150
because many universities are reliant

quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult to find an institution</font>

that's both got the credibility publicly

this from the charges that national

look these are academics they don't know

what they're doing they can't fight

against Chinese spies they can't fight

and this was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that you</font>

actually a technical issue that I think

00:57:22,010 --> 00:57:26,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">is possible to resolve in a quite</font>

compelling sort of interesting way but I

963
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,300
don't talk about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the particular projects</font>

that I'm working on until they're

aside if there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are technical solutions</font>

00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:50,300
this now in the first days again I

1020
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,980
government can't say you can't do this

1021
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:42,770
for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> government did have an</font>

1022
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,180
opportunity<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make their case and maybe</font>

1023
00:59:42,770 --> 00:59:46,009
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> journalists overlooked something</font>

1024
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:48,859
some equity some interests that should

1025
00:59:46,010 --> 00:59:50,810
be taken into account now from my

1026
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,370
perspective this was probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> the best</font>

1027
00:59:50,810 --> 00:59:54,980
that I could have done acting in a

1028
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:57,529
vacuum but then<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ron brought up this</font>

1029
00:59:54,980 --> 01:00:00,110
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> of what should the next</font>

1030
00:59:57,530 --> 01:00:02,120
generation do I would argue actually

1031
01:00:00,110 --> 01:00:05,030
that I'm not the best<font color="#CCCCCC"> placed to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

1032
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:06,529
that argument so actually Ron and Amy

1033
01:00:05,030 --> 01:00:08,630
I'd like to turn it over you what do<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1034
01:00:06,530 --> 01:00:10,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">think the next whistleblower should do</font>

1035
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:12,440
when they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are confronted with sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1036
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:18,500
evidence of unlawful<font color="#E5E5E5"> non-constitutional</font>

1037
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:22,550
activity well you know I reflecting on

1038
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:25,160
the decisions that you made and having

spoken to in the in the more on the

1041
01:00:27,740 --> 01:00:32,029
conservative side of the spectrum I

1042
01:00:29,750 --> 01:00:34,160
guess one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefits if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to</font>

1043
01:00:32,030 --> 01:00:35,420
call<font color="#CCCCCC"> it that of being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the position at</font>

1044
01:00:34,160 --> 01:00:38,950
the Citizen lab where we've done

1045
01:00:35,420 --> 01:00:42,530
research on cyber espionage networks

1046
01:00:38,950 --> 01:00:44,779
I've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> fortunate to be able to enter</font>

1047
01:00:42,530 --> 01:00:47,570
into conversations with people who are

1048
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:53,660
part of national security circles and

1049
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:57,230
NSA FBI and so on and I'm really shocked

1050
01:00:53,660 --> 01:01:00,529
at the extreme reaction that I still see

1051
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:01,790
to this day to what you did ed in those

1052
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:07,070
conversation because I certainly don't

1053
01:01:01,790 --> 01:01:09,800
share that I see what you did as a

1054
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:12,800
heroic effort to open up a<font color="#CCCCCC"> much needed</font>

1055
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:14,660
public debate and we're all<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1056
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:16,760
grateful for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that as citizens this</font>

1057
01:01:14,660 --> 01:01:18,350
needed to happen there are things some

1058
01:01:16,760 --> 01:01:20,660
of us knew were going on

1059
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:24,500
but there it wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> happening in the</font>

1060
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:26,480
conversation and and so I think that

1061
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:28,340
obviously the situation that you're in

1062
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,010
the country that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you now find yourself</font>

1063
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:34,280
in you're not in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> position to be given</font>

1064
01:01:31,010 --> 01:01:36,920
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fair trial under the charges that</font>

1065
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:39,380
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been charged with that is a</font>

1066
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:42,650
pretty daunting prospect for any future

1067
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:44,540
whistleblower and I I don't know exactly

1068
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:49,100
what's gone but I imagine things have

1069
01:01:44,540 --> 01:01:52,820
been ratcheted up even more I was at a

1070
01:01:49,100 --> 01:01:55,610
workshop a couple of weeks<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago at MIT</font>

1071
01:01:52,820 --> 01:01:57,140
and Admiral Rogers was there and I

1072
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:59,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">mentioned that I would be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> here in a</font>

1073
01:01:57,140 --> 01:02:01,779
couple weeks and I asked him what

1074
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:05,900
questions would you suggest I asked

1075
01:02:01,780 --> 01:02:11,750
Edward Snowden and it was as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1076
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:13,400
brought up Darth Vader so I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1077
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:14,930
don't know i don't i think that's

1078
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:16,910
something that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to work on within</font>

1079
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:19,520
liberal democracy is to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure there</font>

1080
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:22,190
are proper avenues and protections for

1081
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:24,800
whistleblowers that extreme charges with

1082
01:02:22,190 --> 01:02:26,960
the most<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimate penalties are put out</font>

1083
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:29,390
there for people who do this that there

1084
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:31,910
is an avenue with in law enforcement

1085
01:02:29,390 --> 01:02:33,589
intelligence organizations for people to

1086
01:02:31,910 --> 01:02:36,200
raise problems through appropriate

1087
01:02:33,590 --> 01:02:40,820
channels if now they don't exist and

1088
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:42,740
those punishments are so severe um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can</font>

1089
01:02:40,820 --> 01:02:44,750
follow up on that just because I you

01:02:42,740 --> 01:02:47,209
know this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is a substantive issue</font>

1100
01:03:09,470 --> 01:03:13,640
know about what would happen because it

1101
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:15,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">just seems so unlikely that one</font>

01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:18,049
individual working with few journals

1103
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:20,920
could actually succeed against such

1104
01:03:18,050 --> 01:03:24,890
incredibly well resourced adversaries

1105
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:26,660
but leaving leaving that aside leaving

1106
01:03:24,890 --> 01:03:28,589
aside the fact that I you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know I don't</font>

1107
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:30,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">think I'm an unhappy</font>

01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:36,150
great deterrent I'm actually more

1110
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:39,150
fulfilled now more connected now and

1111
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:40,740
more effective now in my work and

1112
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:43,170
satisfied with it than I ever have been

1113
01:03:40,740 --> 01:03:44,490
before but when we get back on the focus

1114
01:03:43,170 --> 01:03:46,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the actual material there's one big</font>

1115
01:03:44,490 --> 01:03:48,029
counter-argument to the model question

1116
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:49,770
that we were talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about which is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">or that put lives at risk and was</font>

reckless and there<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course reasonable</font>

1123
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:07,890
could have been handled more carefully

1124
01:04:06,870 --> 01:04:11,060
because the number of documents were

1125

published an unredacted format<font color="#E5E5E5"> however</font>

this is actually i<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the largest</font>

01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:17,700
counter argument that we have against

appropriately and that they really still

write a single paragraph of this

serious damage to<font color="#CCCCCC"> this national security</font>

01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:37,050
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> secret</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> level would cause grave</font>

1161
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:40,049
damage the security national of the

1162
01:05:37,050 --> 01:05:41,490
United States can be published<font color="#E5E5E5"> without</font>

1163
01:05:40,050 --> 01:05:43,080
anyone coming<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1164
01:05:41,490 --> 01:05:44,490
without anyone dying and that's pretty

1165
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:47,490
much a matter of public record now

1166
01:05:44,490 --> 01:05:52,470
because that happened in 2009 2016 now

1167
01:05:47,490 --> 01:05:58,229
there's no real controversy about it are

1168
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:59,879
we have we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> I been too careful this</font>

1169
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:02,130
is a reasonable argument<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be made I</font>

1170
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:05,010
don't know the answer<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I don't think</font>

1171
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:06,800
I'm the right person to answer it but

1172
01:06:05,010 --> 01:06:09,990
increasingly the older I get the more

1173
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:12,990
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of familiar i become with this side</font>

1174
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:18,330
of the equation rather than my previous

1175
01:06:12,990 --> 01:06:20,040
side looking out from the government we

1176
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:22,259
need to be more aggressive<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a</font>

1177
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:26,150
community we need to be more<font color="#E5E5E5"> comfortable</font>

1178
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:29,040
with radicalism and radical change

1179
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:31,440
radical is not a dirty word radical

1180
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:33,720
means we're looking at the fundamental

1181
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:36,480
problems it doesn't mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> extremists it</font>

1182
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:39,020
doesn't mean were you know arguing in

1183
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:42,410
favor of violence or anything like that

1184
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:44,369
but when we're facing systemic problems

1185
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:50,009
we need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to think about systemic</font>

1186
01:06:44,369 --> 01:06:52,170
solutions so one of the slightly

1187
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:53,369
personal story um that I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably</font>

1188
01:06:52,170 --> 01:06:55,550
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in trouble</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with my family</font>

1189
01:06:53,369 --> 01:06:58,650
for telling um one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

1190
01:06:55,550 --> 01:07:00,420
conversations I had Edward after after

1191
01:06:58,650 --> 01:07:03,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">your document started being released was</font>

1192
01:07:00,420 --> 01:07:06,090
with my mother and<font color="#E5E5E5"> she responded very</font>

1193
01:07:03,480 --> 01:07:07,530
strongly<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the fact that somebody had</font>

1194
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:09,510
started releasing these documents and we

1195
01:07:07,530 --> 01:07:10,950
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a long time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1196
01:07:09,510 --> 01:07:14,130
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> she was so</font>

1197
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:16,169
emotional about this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> after about a</font>

1198
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:19,080
30 minute conversation what she said to

1199
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:22,580
me is what I'm scared<font color="#E5E5E5"> of is that you</font>

1200
01:07:19,080 --> 01:07:22,580
would do the same thing in that<font color="#E5E5E5"> position</font>

1201
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:29,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">bradley don't let her access to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1202
01:07:26,910 --> 01:07:30,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">document and i thought that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was very</font>

1203
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:33,359
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because we do tend to</font>

1204
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:35,730
personalize a lot of this activity and a

1205
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,380
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we see but one of</font>

1206
01:07:35,730 --> 01:07:41,130
the things that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i was most amazed by i</font>

1207
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:43,080
have to say<font color="#E5E5E5"> is how many of the programs</font>

1208
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:45,900
that were revealed actually we're

1209
01:07:43,080 --> 01:07:49,319
operating the way that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> are allowed</font>

1210
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:50,970
to operate by law<font color="#E5E5E5"> but still having such</font>

1211
01:07:49,320 --> 01:07:53,580
a profound impact because the law is

1212
01:07:50,970 --> 01:07:55,319
really complicated and really legalese

1213
01:07:53,580 --> 01:07:57,060
and people don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

1214
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,190
um but when they were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finally</font>

1215
01:07:57,060 --> 01:08:01,650
figure out in layman's terms<font color="#CCCCCC"> what was</font>

1216
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:03,780
happening they reacted to that when they

1217
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:05,700
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> prism program was put out in</font>

1218
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:08,190
colorful slides in<font color="#CCCCCC"> The Washington Post</font>

1219
01:08:05,700 --> 01:08:11,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">and The Guardian people were reacted to</font>

1220
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:13,290
that and so I'm trying to channel a few

1221
01:08:11,760 --> 01:08:17,550
of the different audience questions into

1222
01:08:13,290 --> 01:08:21,000
one which is do we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> obligation to</font>

1223
01:08:17,550 --> 01:08:23,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">be explaining how these things work in</font>

1224
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:25,649
that way not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only to people but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> also I</font>

1225
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:28,560
think there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a specific question</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1226
01:08:25,649 --> 01:08:31,500
explaining to children how security

1227
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:33,930
works and how the law works and what are

1228
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:35,819
the barriers to that and how can we do

1229
01:08:33,930 --> 01:08:38,700
things how can we put things in law now

1230
01:08:35,819 --> 01:08:41,880
things like transparency may be in order

1231
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:44,550
to try to equal out the playing field

1232
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:46,770
and make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we are no longer kept</font>

1233
01:08:44,550 --> 01:08:48,570
in the dark about how these programs are

1234
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:50,700
operating and what's happening in the

1235
01:08:48,569 --> 01:08:53,040
government's not only in the US but

1236
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:56,910
around the<font color="#CCCCCC"> world and what's going on is</font>

1237
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:58,319
is there anything we can do so i don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1238
01:08:56,910 --> 01:09:03,569
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> mind going first if you don't mind</font>

1239
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:06,059
add on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that um please so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually I was</font>

1240
01:09:03,569 --> 01:09:08,189
speaking with joseph menn yesterday and

1241
01:09:06,060 --> 01:09:09,510
he<font color="#E5E5E5"> brought up a really good point that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1242
01:09:08,189 --> 01:09:12,660
hadn't quite thought of which is that

1243
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:14,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">organizations like the NSA we we</font>

1244
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:17,250
typically associate their powerful

1245
01:09:14,729 --> 01:09:19,169
capabilities with technical exploits and

1246
01:09:17,250 --> 01:09:21,089
we often<font color="#CCCCCC"> overlook the fact that</font>

1247
01:09:19,170 --> 01:09:24,390
organizations like that and their

1248
01:09:21,089 --> 01:09:26,339
partners have probably equal resources

1249
01:09:24,390 --> 01:09:29,490
and capabilities that they devote to

1250
01:09:26,339 --> 01:09:31,559
legal exploits and you know I've spent

1251
01:09:29,490 --> 01:09:33,599
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> entire career trying to understand</font>

1252
01:09:31,560 --> 01:09:35,670
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world of information security and</font>

1253
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:37,890
signals intelligence and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

1254
01:09:35,670 --> 01:09:39,480
must<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not an American</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but looking</font>

1255
01:09:37,890 --> 01:09:42,650
at the legal system here i'm still

1256
01:09:39,479 --> 01:09:45,089
befuddled by the different layers of

1257
01:09:42,649 --> 01:09:47,639
obfuscating legal arrangements that

1258
01:09:45,089 --> 01:09:51,330
cover this or that and it's like a house

1259
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,609
of cards<font color="#E5E5E5"> that in mystery tunnels of</font>

1260
01:09:51,330 --> 01:09:56,400
legal exceptions and loopholes that

1261
01:09:53,609 --> 01:09:59,460
apply to different aspects and that this

1262
01:09:56,400 --> 01:10:02,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">is extraordinary in terms of a cloak</font>

1263
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:04,920
that can shield various aspects of this

1264
01:10:02,070 --> 01:10:07,679
and it's very hard to bring

1265
01:10:04,920 --> 01:10:09,290
accountability to it let alone explain

1266
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:11,600
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the public in a way that</font>

1267
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:13,580
make sense and of course that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1268
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:16,610
United States which among all of the

1269
01:10:13,580 --> 01:10:20,710
five eyes and probably arguably in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1270
01:10:16,610 --> 01:10:24,070
world has the most adversarial and

1271
01:10:20,710 --> 01:10:27,410
rigorous oversight mechanisms in place

1272
01:10:24,070 --> 01:10:31,450
certainly better than in my country in

1273
01:10:27,410 --> 01:10:33,920
Canada where we have a CSE<font color="#CCCCCC"> Commissioner</font>

1274
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:37,639
essentially a retired judge who once a

1275
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:39,530
year does a review very rarely finds

1276
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:41,900
anything wrong because the judge is

1277
01:10:39,530 --> 01:10:43,880
actually just making sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

1278
01:10:41,900 --> 01:10:46,490
government is complying with their own

1279
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:51,680
interpretation of laws which themselves

1280
01:10:46,490 --> 01:10:54,800
are secret so this is extraordinary and

1281
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:57,980
it shows just how far we are removed

1282
01:10:54,800 --> 01:11:00,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the basic checks and balances</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1284
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:07,490
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> somehow claw those back and</font>

1285
01:11:03,530 --> 01:11:10,639
bring back some measure of proper

1286
01:11:07,490 --> 01:11:13,340
restraints around the exercise of power

1287
01:11:10,640 --> 01:11:19,030
by governments but it is extraordinarily

1288
01:11:13,340 --> 01:11:21,640
complicated on the legal side just a

1289
01:11:19,030 --> 01:11:23,840
personal motive opinion they're on a

1290
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canada's roll it's true their oversight</font>

1291
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:26,840
it's hideous it's it's never been

1292
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,670
effective because<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was never really</font>

1293
01:11:26,840 --> 01:11:31,610
thought about but<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

1294
01:11:28,670 --> 01:11:34,040
that in my experience of the five eyes

1295
01:11:31,610 --> 01:11:36,320
the Canadian<font color="#E5E5E5"> intelligence services were</font>

1296
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:37,760
always the least aggressive they were

1297
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:39,950
the least adventurous they didn't really

1298
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:43,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">push the legal boundaries it was</font>

1299
01:11:39,950 --> 01:11:45,309
difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> target Canadians legally</font>

1300
01:11:43,580 --> 01:11:48,230
and so on<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so forth for surveillance</font>

01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:56,809
started to<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly oversight</font>

1306
01:11:55,430 --> 01:11:58,370
became more important because they

1307
01:11:56,810 --> 01:12:00,530
became much more aggressive in a very

1308
01:11:58,370 --> 01:12:03,070
short period of time but setting that

1309
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:06,559
aside look the broader challenged there

1310
01:12:03,070 --> 01:12:10,370
that amy was was bringing up was how do

1311
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:11,900
we teach children about this and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1312
01:12:10,370 --> 01:12:13,670
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult because what we're</font>

1313
01:12:11,900 --> 01:12:17,960
inheriting is we're inheriting a culture

1314
01:12:13,670 --> 01:12:21,470
here from sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of thousands of years of</font>

1315
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:23,620
human progress of civilization where the

1316
01:12:21,470 --> 01:12:26,930
way that we kept people in line

1317
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:29,269
was explaining<font color="#E5E5E5"> to them that there's an</font>

1318
01:12:26,930 --> 01:12:31,730
omniscient being somewhere up there

above you whether it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> God whether</font>

it's your<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lord whether it's your</font>

1321
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:38,349

01:12:35,750 --> 01:12:40,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">police who know what it is you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing</font>

1323
01:12:38,350 --> 01:12:43,150
and so because of that you shouldn't do

1324
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:47,720
anything bad could just be your parents

1325
01:12:43,150 --> 01:12:49,780
and that kind of authoritarian mentality

1326
01:12:47,720 --> 01:12:52,550
is our first step that's our

1327
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:57,940
indoctrination into the culture of human

1328
01:12:52,550 --> 01:13:00,800
interrelationship at a large scale now

1329

something<font color="#CCCCCC"> happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> progress of</font>

Technology with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> progress of human</font>

1331
01:13:02,780 --> 01:13:08,240
culture where we started to<font color="#CCCCCC"> see people</font>

1332
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:10,460
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> to challenge power more and</font>

1333
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:12,980
more we began to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> the public gaining</font>

1334
01:13:10,460 --> 01:13:14,330
greater and greater voices in the

1335
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:16,099
direction of their governments we saw

1336
01:13:14,330 --> 01:13:20,390
sort of explosion of liberal democracy

1337
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:22,490
and at some point intelligence services

1338
01:13:20,390 --> 01:13:24,710
which is really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a euphemism</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for state</font>

1339
01:13:22,490 --> 01:13:25,940

protecting the state they're protecting

one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a national security what they</font>

1343
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:33,740
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the institutions of that nation</font>

1344
01:13:32,540 --> 01:13:41,240
not really the country<font color="#E5E5E5"> and its people</font>

1345
01:13:33,740 --> 01:13:43,280
particularly there is a culture within

1346
01:13:41,240 --> 01:13:45,460
government and I've seen it sitting in

1347
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:47,900
meetings you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know throughout my career</font>

1348
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:50,690
you've seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> briefings you sit in slides</font>

1349
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:53,420
you see it<font color="#E5E5E5"> everywhere where they go what</font>

1350
01:13:50,690 --> 01:13:56,509
can we do not what should we do and

01:13:53,420 --> 01:13:58,670
eventually technology<font color="#E5E5E5"> reach the point</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">we're in secret behind closed doors</font>

01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:03,380
without the involvement in public the

wow we may not<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to ask God a</font>

01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:12,110
question about what this person is doing

if you believe in<font color="#CCCCCC"> God we can build our</font>

realize how<font color="#CCCCCC"> repugnant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that is</font>

1368
01:14:36,180 --> 01:14:40,320
when it's very difficult in even in most

01:14:39,090 --> 01:14:43,170
modern societies to even have

1370
01:14:40,320 --> 01:14:44,940
discussions about that level of dis

carrying<font color="#E5E5E5"> our almost religious</font>

disempowered to a point where if you

want it to resist<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you wanted to</font>

the capability no matter how well

1378
01:14:58,260 --> 01:15:05,490
organized you are that's something that

1379

if we don't recognize<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pardon me for</font>

1384
01:15:16,770 --> 01:15:20,520
again thinking about our language think

1385
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:21,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">about how we phrase things need about</font>

1386
01:15:20,520 --> 01:15:23,310
how we communicate what are the cultures

1387
01:15:21,870 --> 01:15:26,040
that were building they were<font color="#CCCCCC"> passing to</font>

1388
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:28,050
our friends you know when I<font color="#E5E5E5"> was growing</font>

1389
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:31,890
up when I was in school whenever

1390
01:15:28,050 --> 01:15:33,870
somebody asks you something or basically

1391
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:35,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">threw shade on your activities they</font>

01:15:37,440 --> 01:15:42,780
a free country isn't I don't hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a</font>

1395
01:15:40,350 --> 01:15:47,430
lot anymore I don't see that<font color="#E5E5E5"> on shows I</font>

1396
01:15:42,780 --> 01:15:50,219
don't see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in movies when our values</font>

1397
01:15:47,430 --> 01:15:52,800
have begun<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fall out a favor in the</font>

1398
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:54,930
terms of the way they're communicated we

1399
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:57,690
need to think very hard about are we

1400
01:15:54,930 --> 01:16:02,310
losing them and if we<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how can we</font>

1401
01:15:57,690 --> 01:16:04,830
reinforce them so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you</font>

1402
01:16:02,310 --> 01:16:06,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">both time for some short closing</font>

1403
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:09,210
comments because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

1404
01:16:06,210 --> 01:16:11,490
time or a little over time but I want to

1405
01:16:09,210 --> 01:16:13,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw two thoughts to you and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can</font>

1406
01:16:11,490 --> 01:16:15,900
either respond to either of these or go

1407
01:16:13,350 --> 01:16:18,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">off on your own way the first is that</font>

1408
01:16:15,900 --> 01:16:21,210
yesterday I was actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> sent a photo of</font>

1409
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:23,460
a panel on technology policy from back

1410
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:25,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">in Washington</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DC and the reason I would</font>

1411
01:16:23,460 --> 01:16:28,170
send that photo was because the panel

1412
01:16:25,020 --> 01:16:30,180
consisted of five white men and I can't

1413
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:33,570
help<font color="#E5E5E5"> but look at the stage today and see</font>

1414
01:16:30,180 --> 01:16:35,970
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> have as close problem and</font>

1415
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:38,400
calling myself out here<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little bit so</font>

1416
01:16:35,970 --> 01:16:41,280
the first one is can we support efforts

1417
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:43,700
how do we support efforts by groups and

1418
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:46,590
organizations to help protect

1419
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:49,139
marginalized and vulnerable communities

1420
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:49,900
especially when they are far too often

1421
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:52,750
left out of the

1422
01:16:49,900 --> 01:16:54,040
versation the second piece that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I want</font>

1423
01:16:52,750 --> 01:16:56,290
to throw<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there for comment</font>

1424
01:16:54,040 --> 01:16:59,650
potentially is that I was recently told

1425
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:02,320
by a former<font color="#CCCCCC"> National Security high-level</font>

1426
01:16:59,650 --> 01:17:06,040
official that tear the threat of

1427
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:09,870
terrorism kept him awake at night and I

1428
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:12,190
told<font color="#E5E5E5"> him that I don't believe him um</font>

1429
01:17:09,870 --> 01:17:14,320
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> I actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that he</font>

1430
01:17:12,190 --> 01:17:17,440
loses sleep over that but is there

1431
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:18,730
anything that you would say on the same

1432
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:21,040
level is there anything that you think

1433
01:17:18,730 --> 01:17:22,750
keeps you awake at night um any worries

1434
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:24,850
that you have that when you look out and

1435
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:26,440
think this is a real threat that we're

1436
01:17:24,850 --> 01:17:28,540
facing right now and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a thing</font>

1437
01:17:26,440 --> 01:17:33,849
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think is going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> problem as</font>

01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:35,290
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future goes on so I think I can</font>

United States or Canada and frankly I

1449
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:05,980
think the trends are really quite

1450
01:18:00,820 --> 01:18:08,920
disturbing I think that we see problems

1451
01:18:05,980 --> 01:18:12,428
magnified and not part of the world that

1452

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually we're contributing to in many</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">rights activists and journalists and so</font>

1461
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:35,920
on when essentially we're doing those

1462
01:18:32,469 --> 01:18:38,949
very same things here and if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look</font>

just at the demographics<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of</font>

1471
01:18:57,330 --> 01:19:03,119
alone it's very important to make sure

to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> these Congress</font>

so much from them about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to approach</font>

01:19:29,519 --> 01:19:35,669
not just a sense of<font color="#E5E5E5"> community response I</font>

the most highly targeted communities in

Canaries in a coal mine because of the

1487
01:19:41,579 --> 01:19:46,438
situation there so they've seen

1488
01:19:43,709 --> 01:19:49,639
everything thrown at them when you hear

1489
01:19:46,439 --> 01:19:52,280
the US government officials talk about

1490
01:19:49,639 --> 01:19:55,590
advanced persistent threats targeting

fortune 500 companies Tibetans are

1492
01:19:55,590 --> 01:20:00,329
experiencing that as well the way that

1493
01:19:58,050 --> 01:20:02,639
they've reacted to that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> has been</font>

1494
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:05,159
really admirable both in terms of

01:20:02,639 --> 01:20:07,379
network defenses but also in terms of

1496
01:20:05,159 --> 01:20:09,089
educating their community on best

1497
01:20:07,379 --> 01:20:10,860
practice and that's why you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

bring in people outside the usual

traditionally at least as I look at it

01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:52,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">sort of tried to puzzle out human</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">to focus more on it one of the things</font>

1520
01:21:11,489 --> 01:21:15,879
actually encourages me on this is the

1521
01:21:15,090 --> 01:21:18,790
fact

1522
01:21:15,880 --> 01:21:21,030
that I'm seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> more and more people who</font>

come from underprivileged backgrounds

who come from minority backgrounds who

1525
01:21:24,429 --> 01:21:30,489
didn't enjoy the same advantages that

1526

for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> I myself did and yet they</font>

1527
01:21:30,489 --> 01:21:38,199
are much more capable relative to me

1528
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:39,730
than I was at that age and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1529
01:21:38,199 --> 01:21:42,129
maybe this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just advances in</font>

01:21:39,730 --> 01:21:44,949
technology and you know sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of each</font>

1531

generation gets better than the last but

1532
01:21:44,949 --> 01:21:49,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">I like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to think that it's something more</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">I like to think that you know when you</font>

have people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who have been exposed to</font>

there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us with more</font>

1546
01:22:19,060 --> 01:22:25,120
we know it's false at least in the West

1547
01:22:20,830 --> 01:22:28,000
right there was a recent sort of media

1548
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:31,809
hysteria over the attacks in Brussels

1549
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:34,030
which were a monstrous crime but when

1550
01:22:31,810 --> 01:22:36,670
you look at the actual metrics of lives

1551
01:22:34,030 --> 01:22:39,070
lost due to terrorism over the case of

1552

the last year 40 50 years<font color="#E5E5E5"> in in Western</font>

Europe they lost more lives more

ETA then they have ever lost against

was much higher<font color="#CCCCCC"> in previous areas as</font>

01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:11,888
well it's too easy for us to forget the

actually place explosives in her hotel

1567
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:24,790
and nearly<font color="#CCCCCC"> killed her at a summit um yes</font>

1568
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:26,210
it is outrageous it's appalling and we

1569
01:23:24,790 --> 01:23:29,480
should condemn

1570
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:31,310
the people or engage in the kind of

01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:34,190
murderous criminality that's claiming

1572
01:23:31,310 --> 01:23:36,710
lives at subway stations<font color="#CCCCCC"> and airports</font>

01:23:34,190 --> 01:23:39,769
but at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same time we should not</font>

1574
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:42,489
delude ourselves into thinking we face a

period of objectively greater threat now

1576
01:23:42,489 --> 01:23:46,309
then when our actual structures of
