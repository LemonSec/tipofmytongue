00:00:05,930 --> 00:00:14,670
hello right Scott and welcome to the

2
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,310
second day at nine o'clock so I'm the

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,960
first lightning toward speaker as you

4
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,990
can probably tell i'm not speaking at

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:24,750
exactly a lightning pace here<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was</font>

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:28,740
going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do a presentation using my</font>

7
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,539
outdoor<font color="#E5E5E5"> activist voice but then i</font>

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,339
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be speaking at</font>

9
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:34,440
nine o'clock in the morning and<font color="#CCCCCC"> at nine</font>

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,020
other calculor morning no one wants<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,449
hear<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> high energy least of</font>

12
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">all me I'm not sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I can even muster</font>

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:45,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of energy at nine o'clock in</font>

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:50,250
the morning we have six incredible

15
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:52,829
speakers for you and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I am one of them so</font>

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,600
I'm actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons I'm</font>

17
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:57,059
going to be relatively downbeat in this

18
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,579
this first<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk is because I'm</font>

19
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,439
discussing a relatively downbeat topic

20
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:10,110
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have the the website art please</font>

21
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:11,970
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> October of last year I i started</font>

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:14,789
my name is<font color="#CCCCCC"> Larry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> O'Brien I went for the</font>

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:18,030
Electronic Frontier Foundation and I did

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:20,159
a small site here called offline which

25
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,500
was to draw<font color="#CCCCCC"> attention to the increasing</font>

26
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of technologists who were being</font>

27
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:28,829
targeted with detention and imprisonment

28
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:31,439
around the world and this this this

29
00:01:28,829 --> 00:01:33,570
actually comes from partly from my

30
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,339
experience working<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the Committee to</font>

31
00:01:33,570 --> 00:01:37,679
Protect Journalists there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long</font>

32
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:42,740
tradition that we're not necessarily all

33
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:47,280
aware of of creating movements around

34
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:49,679
individuals journalists writers when

35
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,880
they're imprisoned to restore some of

36
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:56,490
their integrity and to widen awareness

37
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,670
of their situation to a broader audience

38
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,399
and my concern<font color="#E5E5E5"> when I rejoin the FF was</font>

39
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:03,869
that in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same way as journalists and</font>

40
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,509
writers are targeted because of their

41
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:08,520
disproportionate effect in protecting

42
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,220
human rights and exercising human rights

43
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,720
of freedom of expression and assoc

44
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:12,920
version that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same thing was going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:14,590
happen to technologists the

46
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,179
technologists were going to be

47
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:20,180
specifically targeted because if you

48
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:22,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">take out technologists you can diminish</font>

49
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:27,980
the magnifying effect that they can have

50
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:29,450
on dissent in reform as I worked on

51
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,679
offline<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if we could scroll it down a</font>

61
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,600
was editing their stories in a

62
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,870
particularly interesting way when you

63
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:05,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">win you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> when you write about individual</font>

65
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:11,090
them into heroes you end up editing the

66
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:13,850
gray areas and the story becomes much

67
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:16,519
more black and<font color="#CCCCCC"> white and this is</font>

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:18,170
understandable<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a lot of reasons one</font>

69
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,690
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the reasons why people are detained</font>

70
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:22,280
and targeted in this way is to defame

71
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,410
them is to separate them from the rest

72
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,590
of society and one of the ways you do

73
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:32,269
that is you pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> on you know tiny flaws</font>

74
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:35,030
or imaginary conspiracies and you throw

75
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:37,010
as much mud as you can and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'd hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

76
00:03:35,030 --> 00:03:38,300
it sticks and and tiring them with<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

77
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:40,940
prison sentence is one of the most

78
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:44,870
effective ways of doing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> um</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but it</font>

79
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:47,810
felt strange to ally the shades of<font color="#CCCCCC"> grey</font>

80
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:49,700
if it felt strange to me to be writing

81
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:52,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">these stories and these people aren't</font>

82
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,950
sinners but they're not Saints either

83
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,190
and one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the reasons</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> why that happens</font>

84
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:59,988
as well is its distance frankly the

85
00:03:58,190 --> 00:04:01,910
further you are away<font color="#CCCCCC"> from a political</font>

situation the easier it is to be

<font color="#E5E5E5">people outside of our community right</font>

91
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:15,980
when we talk about journalists when I

92
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:18,310
wrote about<font color="#CCCCCC"> journalists the Committee to</font>

Protect Journalists protect journalists

94
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:24,530
you know you saw them as heroes

95
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:26,060
in a country not your own whereas in

96
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,190
that country of course journalists are

97
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:30,169
as controversial as they are in your own

98
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:31,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">country you know no one no one has</font>

99
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:33,590
absolute respect for a journalist

100
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:35,599
particularly representing an opposite

101
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,448
political view so it's a distance thing

102
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,260
that turns things into black<font color="#CCCCCC"> and white I</font>

103
00:04:37,449 --> 00:04:41,150
realize<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be a</font>

that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> more dling bet that I've made</font>

106
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,409
by launching off line is that we're

107
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,760
going to see<font color="#E5E5E5"> more people in this lifts</font>

the technology is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to be</font>

112
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:01,219
close to us because over there they're

113
00:04:57,740 --> 00:05:03,949
our friends we have loyalty to them but

114
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:08,800
we also see<font color="#CCCCCC"> these shades of grey and</font>

115
00:05:03,949 --> 00:05:08,800
that shades of<font color="#E5E5E5"> grey can be debilitating</font>

116
00:05:09,850 --> 00:05:15,680
many people saw sort so Aaron Swartz as

117
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:18,050
a hero after after<font color="#E5E5E5"> his his passing away</font>

118
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,590
but many of us also remembered when he

119
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:25,070
was arrested and how ambiguous and and

120
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:26,539
diminished the response was in those

121
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:28,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">early days if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go through</font>

122
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:30,889
the internet archive and look at

123
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,229
people's responses the moment a charge

124
00:05:30,889 --> 00:05:35,840
was made there was a distancing effect

125
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:38,210
and people people walked away from a

126
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,619
person who<font color="#E5E5E5"> was at that particular moment</font>

127
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:44,719
most vulnerable a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of weeks ago a</font>

128
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:47,030
Facebook vice president was was arrested

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:49,430
in Brazil and I had this interesting

130
00:05:47,030 --> 00:05:53,198
moment of going well well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> prison do</font>

131
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:57,800
we look through at a president of a

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,630
corporation who is arrested in that

133
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,970
situation for protecting the privacy of

134
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:03,620
their users and I think that viewpoint

135
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:05,570
looks very different if you're in Brazil

136
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,910
than if you're looking from outside

137
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,159
Brazil and we know all these names but

138
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:12,410
but but I mean does anyone know the name

139
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">of the the Facebook vice president I do</font>

140
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:18,080
but I looked it up it's diego de cerdo

141
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:19,940
and he was detained for a day how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

142
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">write about that I don't have any good</font>

143
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:23,840
answers to this and it's very early<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

144
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,460
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> morning</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> expect any of you</font>

145
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,869
to have good answers to this this is

146
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:29,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that communities have</font>

Iran one hot afternoon we were strolling

continued we entered a fabric store and

00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:54,790
as we entered the door opened up again

194
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:59,810
so I turned around and my heart sank

195
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:04,240
there there were two men in uniform with

196
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:07,790
mean piercing eyes staring right at me I

197
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:11,090
knew there were the moral police and

198
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:13,280
they were there<font color="#CCCCCC"> for me the men</font>

199
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:15,640
approached me and said because my hair

200
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:19,100
had shown they were going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to arrest me</font>

201
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:21,710
mom refused to let<font color="#CCCCCC"> me be taken alone so</font>

202
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:25,280
they piled all of us<font color="#CCCCCC"> into a van and took</font>

203
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:27,560
us in the best that I could come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with</font>

204
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,600
was to pretend that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was religious so I</font>

205
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:31,250
asked for<font color="#CCCCCC"> a notepad</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and a pen and jotted</font>

206
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:34,600
down everything they were saying as fast

207
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:38,390
as I could like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really good student I</font>

208
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:41,980
was held for five hours and only

released after repenting and writing

next time they warned I would receive

433
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,590
tell you having worked for 23 years and

434
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,730
diplomacy it's very I do think that

435
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,959
national governments actually have

436
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:44,669
pretty good knowledge and pretty good

437
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,020
idea of what what needs to be done and

<font color="#E5E5E5">often we do have our hearts in the right</font>

441
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:56,039
that does point to a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a potential</font>

442
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:57,780
naivete in the petition model because

443
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,690
when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're petitioning you're asking</font>

00:21:57,780 --> 00:22:01,820
someone else to take action on your

445
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:03,929

449
00:22:08,010 --> 00:22:12,780

450
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:14,940
what you find in global affairs is that

00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:17,280
global leaders end up looking like this

452
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:19,260
guy the wizard of oz himself who as we

459
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:36,168
government citizens themselves need to

460
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:38,820
band together to take direct action in

461
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:40,780
what Mitchell<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the Mozilla</font>

462
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:43,360
Foundation yesterday morning said

463
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:45,970
is distributed action the most powerful

464
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,169
method of human collaboration<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we've</font>

465
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:48,930
seen that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is made possible</font>

466
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:51,250
in many different domains of human life

<font color="#CCCCCC">needs to be harnessed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for global affairs</font>

468
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:57,190
now that leads me to another accusation

469
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:58,480
that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> often get when we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to</font>

471
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,070

472
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:05,320
accused of collectivism this is a famous

<font color="#CCCCCC">that a lot of the online organizing that</font>

476
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:17,199
takes place is extremely short term it's

477
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:19,600
a petition that might<font color="#E5E5E5"> just last for a</font>

revolutionaries came together to change

00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:28,150
their governments but a year later those

482
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:29,880
movements barely existed whatsoever

483
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:34,210
there's a kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term</font>

484
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:38,260
short-termism in civic organizing and

485
00:23:34,210 --> 00:23:39,730
often some of the causes that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> see on</font>

486
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,190
petition sites tend to be relatively

487
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:44,050
superficial in their in their<font color="#CCCCCC"> reach and</font>

488
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,610
in their impact how many of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

489
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">been asked to sign petitions to save</font>

490
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:50,260
bees I have nothing against saving bees

491
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:52,000
but the reason<font color="#CCCCCC"> that they're so popular</font>

492
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,440
on all these petition sites is that they

493
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,860
have this wide appeal that no one could

494
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:00,160
put it action that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> powered by social</font>

495
00:23:56,860 --> 00:24:01,419
algorithms so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a company</font>

496
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,970
like Facebook is actually quite

497
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,610
successful in motivating users to

498
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:08,410
undertake actions over and over and over

499
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,850
again and undertake more significant

500
00:24:08,410 --> 00:24:12,700
actions is because they study<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

patterns of users behavior online to

those that are taking

perennial aims to build a distributed

model for civic engagement in global

524
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:08,409
affairs powered by social algorithms and

525
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,480
protected through a blockchain the

526
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:13,540
blockchain is an architecture which

527
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:16,780
allows you to separate<font color="#E5E5E5"> the key pieces of</font>

00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:20,020
social algorithms is going to have

530
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:21,939
personal data that needs to be kept

it'll be protected through the

as a<font color="#CCCCCC"> laboratory for moved for civic</font>

HG Wells who as many of you know was

<font color="#CCCCCC">Human Rights the idea that everyone</font>

anti-colonialist and Gandhi's response

681
00:31:15,629 --> 00:31:21,478
is illustrative in a couple ways Gandhi

682
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:24,719
responds with this instead of focusing

683
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:26,519
<font color="#CCCCCC">exclusively on rights well should</font>

684
00:31:24,719 --> 00:31:29,190
instead begin with the charter of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:32,179
duties of man and I promise that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

686
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:35,629
rights will follow as spring

687

winter now apart from<font color="#CCCCCC"> being a sort of</font>

688
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:40,610
quirky historical anecdote I think this

689
00:31:38,899 --> 00:31:44,330
this exchange is illustrative in a

690
00:31:40,610 --> 00:31:47,240
couple ways it shows us first of all of

691
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:49,189
a very basic fact which is that the

692
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:51,710
language<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Human Rights is not the only</font>

693
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:54,259
language available to us to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

694
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:55,639
issues<font color="#E5E5E5"> of digital justice in fact there</font>

695
00:31:54,259 --> 00:31:58,009
are many discourses than many

696
00:31:55,639 --> 00:32:00,678
vocabularies we can use and some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

697
00:31:58,009 --> 00:32:03,139
those resonate with others I think the

698
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:05,240
exchange also hints at the fact that

699
00:32:03,139 --> 00:32:07,639
different vocabularies resonate with

700
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:10,210
different audiences especially those in

701
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:12,649
the global north and the global<font color="#E5E5E5"> South</font>

702
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:16,940
especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language of duty and</font>

703
00:32:12,649 --> 00:32:23,029
obligation which often resonates in much

704
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:25,039
of Latin America Africa and Asia not to

705
00:32:23,029 --> 00:32:27,889
create<font color="#CCCCCC"> a overly simple dichotomy but</font>

706
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:30,139
often to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> anglo-american rights</font>

707
00:32:27,889 --> 00:32:32,889
tradition which focuses on individual of

rights against the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state against</font>

709
00:32:32,889 --> 00:32:38,449
infringement this idea of a mutual

710
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:41,269
reciprocal relationship can seem a bit

711
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:44,090
foreign but in fact it's part of the

712
00:32:41,269 --> 00:32:46,940
rice tradition going back all the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

00:32:44,090 --> 00:32:50,779
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 40s and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think it can also help us</font>

714
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,779
address this idea of really<font color="#CCCCCC"> the language</font>

715
00:32:50,779 --> 00:32:55,279
of vocabulary of duty<font color="#CCCCCC"> and responsibility</font>

716
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:57,590
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> help us address some of the limits</font>

717
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:00,139
and the problems we're seeing with

718
00:32:57,590 --> 00:33:02,928
rights today so I assume if everyone

719

here is you know attending that you're a

720

fan of the idea of<font color="#CCCCCC"> human rights but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

721
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:12,499
some ways we're seeing rights language

722
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,679
become over extended and used in ways

723

to refrain from arbitrary limitation of

00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:47,930
this freedom and prevent denial of

reasonable access to channels of

00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:53,450
communication and so you know just here

783
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:55,730
in this little claws we see what has

whether states and private actors can

towards this greater sense of digital

and specificity and that adopting<font color="#CCCCCC"> dd's</font>

00:47:20,999 --> 00:47:25,930
gathering over 7 million reports and

1014
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:28,229
that's actually just in the cloud

1015
00:47:25,930 --> 00:47:32,019
version of the software open source

1016
00:47:28,229 --> 00:47:33,489
because the software<font color="#CCCCCC"> is open</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> source it's</font>

1017
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:35,649
on its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> server</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so we don't actually</font>

1018
00:47:33,489 --> 00:47:37,630
know how many reports are being gathered

1019
00:47:35,650 --> 00:47:42,249
right that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the benefit from the pros</font>

1020
00:47:37,630 --> 00:47:45,069
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> cons of open source so I it's been a</font>

1021
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:48,910
really powerful story about two years

1022
00:47:45,069 --> 00:47:50,769
ago we started rebuilding the core

1023
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:54,940
software about two and a half years<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago</font>

1024
00:47:50,769 --> 00:47:57,669
I trying to learn and build a new

1025
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,979
version of shaheedi because the original

1026
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:02,380
code base was written in 2009 had gotten

1027
00:47:59,979 --> 00:48:04,868
a little old<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it was starting to be</font>

1028
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,180
held together by duct tape and popsicle

1029
00:48:04,869 --> 00:48:10,209
sticks and so we we built a new version

1030
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:12,339
a new<font color="#CCCCCC"> architecture and to do that we had</font>

1031
00:48:10,209 --> 00:48:14,169
to understand<font color="#CCCCCC"> really you know the first</font>

1032
00:48:12,339 --> 00:48:17,049
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> we built it we had a very simple</font>

1033
00:48:14,170 --> 00:48:21,670
use case and we had for initial users

1034
00:48:17,049 --> 00:48:24,569
right the four founders now we had a

1035
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:28,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">hundred thousand deployers seven million</font>

1036
00:48:24,569 --> 00:48:31,119
reporters I that gets pretty hard that's

1037
00:48:28,509 --> 00:48:32,979
a totally different problem to solve so

1038
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:34,779
we looked first okay who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are the main</font>

1039
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:37,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">people using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your shaheedi well there</font>

1040
00:48:34,779 --> 00:48:39,640
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> three core groups if we think about</font>

1041
00:48:37,390 --> 00:48:42,489
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> like industry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> human rights reporting</font>

1042
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,759
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Syria tracker doc crowd maps six</font>

1045
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:51,939
ports of violence in Syria I think

1046
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:54,400
there's now a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8000 maybe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> even over</font>

1047
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:57,190
10,000 reports on that website one of

1048
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:59,470
the most powerful firsthand archives of

1049
00:48:57,190 --> 00:49:04,930
one of the greatest travesties of this

1050
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:08,529
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> century and I the second was human</font>

now actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> across North Africa what I</font>

1056
00:49:21,849 --> 00:49:26,020
loved was this was just a group of

1057
00:49:23,170 --> 00:49:27,910
citizens doing this using our open

1058
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:31,570
source software putting it on a website

1059
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:34,118
<font color="#E5E5E5">and now they are a over 20 person</font>

1060

1061

women's rights in<font color="#E5E5E5"> in North Africa and</font>

1062
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:40,690
the Middle East and and then the<font color="#E5E5E5"> third</font>

1063
00:49:39,099 --> 00:49:42,339
you know citizen and government kind of

1064
00:49:40,690 --> 00:49:45,099
call this transparency this is election

1065
00:49:42,339 --> 00:49:47,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">monitoring this is corruption mapping</font>

1066
00:49:45,099 --> 00:49:51,160
this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of piece of citizens trying to</font>

1067
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:54,759
bring attention to to their needs as

1068
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:56,348
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> as bad actors so these are kind of</font>

1069
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:58,119
the three big groups but then by the

1070
00:49:56,349 --> 00:50:00,490
type there were kind of two different

1071
00:49:58,119 --> 00:50:05,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">ways people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> were using our crowdsourcing</font>

1072
00:50:00,490 --> 00:50:08,020
tool the first wise response so this is

1073
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:09,520
I'll say election monitoring or crisis

1074
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,560
response if you've heard of shaheedi

1075
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:13,329
this might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be one of the ways that</font>

1076
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,710
you've heard<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it the haiti reports the</font>

1077
00:50:13,329 --> 00:50:19,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">japan most recently earthquake the most</font>

1078
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:21,400
recently than the Nepal earthquake and

1079
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:24,040
in this case you're trying to gather

1080
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:26,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">information from what from someone let's</font>

1081
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:28,810
say<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's saying help I'm stuck and you</font>

1082
00:50:26,560 --> 00:50:31,029
want to help them want to help that want

1083
00:50:28,810 --> 00:50:33,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">that one person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to respond to</font>

1084
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:36,210
that report<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to allocate your</font>

1085
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:38,680
resources more effectively the second is

1086
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:40,810
transparency or sort of advocacy and

1087
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:43,410
this is different this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is you want to</font>

1088
00:50:40,810 --> 00:50:49,089
gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> all as many voices as possible</font>

1089
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:51,490
and and and then try to build a body of

1090
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:53,980
knowledge say this is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem right in</font>

1091
00:50:51,490 --> 00:50:57,279
in Egypt and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> harassed map there it</font>

1092
00:50:53,980 --> 00:50:59,140
would be really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it is problematic to to</font>

1093
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:01,000
try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be responding</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> each one of</font>

1094
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:04,060
those harassment cases

1095
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:06,160
that's as a small civil organization but

1096
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:08,920
by gathering everyone's voices and

1097
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,620
having thousands of examples they can

1098
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:15,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">start to say this is a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> problem and try</font>

1099
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:16,779
to direct policy and attention and enter

1100
00:51:15,550 --> 00:51:20,680
the international community to do

1101
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:23,410
something about it so as we we learned

1102
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,540
we looked at kind of the way and thought

1103
00:51:23,410 --> 00:51:28,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">about the way that kind of this term</font>

1104
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:30,970
crowdsourcing or just data is

1105
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:33,790
influencing the transparency in response

1106
00:51:30,970 --> 00:51:35,350
the humanitarian space and we think

1107
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:37,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it kind of like a data supply</font>

1108
00:51:35,350 --> 00:51:40,089
chain this is this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the best way</font>

1109
00:51:37,930 --> 00:51:41,799
you have gathering of information so

1110
00:51:40,090 --> 00:51:44,320
that's kind of where or<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think who</font>

1111
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:46,660
should he<font color="#E5E5E5"> D as a tool excels we help</font>

1112
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:49,810
people gather information from all sorts

1113
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:52,089
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different ways and then you analyze</font>

1114
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:54,570
it you compress it you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

1115
00:51:52,090 --> 00:51:57,460
you filter it you try to gain insight

1116
00:51:54,570 --> 00:52:01,600
and then you do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you respond</font>

1117
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:03,130
perhaps to that and and then you you or

1118
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,170
you might visualize it you might try<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1119
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:07,780
analyze trends and get into predictive

1120
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:10,030
components so that's that was sort of

1121
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:12,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trick chain we were seeing and the</font>

1122
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:14,230
way that we think about our tool and

1123
00:52:12,970 --> 00:52:16,959
fundamentally is trying to answer this

1124
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:19,240
question of what happened when and where

1125
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:21,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happening on the ground</font>

1126
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:26,379
that's the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we're building</font>

1127
00:52:21,790 --> 00:52:28,180
tools to help people solve and I and so

1128
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,420
to dive a little deeper right what

1129
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,819
happens is anyone pens in information it

1130
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,440
gets processed you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> then not only</font>

1131
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:37,480
crowdsource the information<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1132
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:39,790
coming in but you can also crowdsource

1133
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:42,480
the filtering and understanding of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1134
00:52:39,790 --> 00:52:44,800
information so everyone in this room

1135
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:46,510
sitting at their you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I was called</font>

1136
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,810
armchair volunteer sitting all over the

1137
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:52,140
world could begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> log</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> into your</font>

1138
00:52:49,810 --> 00:52:54,960
instance or whether it's your entire I

1139
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:56,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">it perhaps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's your entire staff and</font>

1140
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,510
this table<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be working</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1141
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:00,730
translation and this table<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be</font>

1142
00:52:58,510 --> 00:53:02,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">working on just checking location and</font>

1143
00:53:00,730 --> 00:53:04,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> table could be doing first step</font>

1144
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:08,770
verification second step verification

1145
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:10,330
right before<font color="#E5E5E5"> it goes to goes out and</font>

1146
00:53:08,770 --> 00:53:14,800
then you have your analysts over here

1147
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:16,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right then so the tool</font>

1148
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:18,460
you to manage that<font color="#E5E5E5"> workflow basically</font>

1149
00:53:16,780 --> 00:53:20,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">ask the bait one of the big things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1150
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:22,930
we built up in the next version of your

1151
00:53:20,410 --> 00:53:26,440
shaheedi first was complex forms second

1152
00:53:22,930 --> 00:53:27,669
was managing workflow and so kind of one

1153
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,990
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the most important things I think</font>

1154
00:53:27,670 --> 00:53:31,060
when you're MIT when your crowdsourcing

1155
00:53:28,990 --> 00:53:34,569
information go to where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

1156
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:36,130
don't build your own app you know that's

1157
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:38,740
like really annoying people have to go

1158
00:53:36,130 --> 00:53:40,060
download your app that's obnoxious I

1159
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:43,959
hate downloading apps I don't know about

1160
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:46,509
you so we build in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ability to gather</font>

1161
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:48,700
to information via text message via

1162
00:53:46,510 --> 00:53:50,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">email web form this was sort of the</font>

00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:52,359
original<font color="#CCCCCC"> nuanced abuse shaheedi go to</font>

1164
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:54,010
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the people are allow you to gather</font>

1165
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:56,470
a bunch of direct crowd-sourced

1166
00:53:54,010 --> 00:53:58,030
information as well as<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to gain a</font>

1167
00:53:56,470 --> 00:54:00,339
little bit of signal through the noise

1168
00:53:58,030 --> 00:54:02,110
so solving the problem of reading the

1169
00:54:00,340 --> 00:54:04,600
entire<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet is pretty difficult</font>

1170
00:54:02,110 --> 00:54:06,070
there are for-profit companies out there

1171
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:09,100
that do it I think it's quite

1172
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:11,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenging in the nonprofit space but</font>

1173
00:54:09,100 --> 00:54:13,240
but you can still try<font color="#E5E5E5"> to gain specific</font>

1174
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:16,509
insight by looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> through our RSS feeds</font>

1175
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:18,520
hashtags specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> api's that we then</font>

1176
00:54:16,510 --> 00:54:21,280
allow you to filter through like if this

1177
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:23,320
then that type statements so if this

1178
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:25,300
hashtag has a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> word on it and</font>

1179
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,640
you know help and it comes<font color="#CCCCCC"> from this</font>

1180
00:54:25,300 --> 00:54:30,250
specific location during this time then

1181
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:32,710
put it into<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bucket of immediate</font>

1182
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:35,170
response and then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said you can</font>

1183
00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:36,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">filter you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verify amongst your group</font>

1184
00:54:35,170 --> 00:54:38,800
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then the outputs is you know one is</font>

1185
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:41,020
a map which looks really great on slides

1186
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:42,880
but it's also you know you can send

1187
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:45,580
alerts you can get a<font color="#CCCCCC"> text message hey I</font>

1188
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:49,240
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if there's been a instance</font>

1189
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:50,740
of harassment rape or violence in my

1190
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:55,330
neighborhood send me a text<font color="#CCCCCC"> message</font>

1191
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:56,919
geofence that send me you can visualize

1192
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:58,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">it you can begin</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to look at trends and</font>

1193
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,390
then you can export the data and put it

1194
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:05,170
into other great tools for analysis that

1195
00:55:01,390 --> 00:55:07,509
are out there I so a couple of examples

1196
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:08,860
of the new version I like this one this

1197
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:11,290
is what they're going on an election

1198
00:55:08,860 --> 00:55:13,150

1199
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:15,460
remembers like vote or die what did I

1200
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:18,880
boat like P Diddy this is like way

1201
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:22,360
better vote like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a boss so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

that one report right that's that's a

1217
00:55:56,830 --> 00:56:00,819
little more challenging you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to find</font>

1218
00:55:57,970 --> 00:56:03,098
that one blog post much harder to go to

1258
00:57:46,750 --> 00:57:50,800
source software was that I actually

1259
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:52,300
found out recently that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UN</font>

Department of field services the

years and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we actually didn't even really</font>

1268
00:58:07,390 --> 00:58:13,060
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the largest</font>

1269
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:15,700
impact that we make that we didn't know

1270
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:17,170
about so again pros and cons of open

1271
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:18,970
source but it's it's awesome because

1272
00:58:17,170 --> 00:58:21,310
they've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> using it and they use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1273
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:22,899
across eight of their countries they

1274
00:58:21,310 --> 00:58:29,590
work in some of the hardest places you

1275
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:31,720
can work Molly Somalia I DRC so it's

1276
00:58:29,590 --> 00:58:34,420
pretty powerful<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they're using that</font>

1277
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:35,740
internally for their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own staff to be</font>

1281
00:58:40,330 --> 00:58:43,270
kind of the story of shaheedi over the

am frankly a white American male working
