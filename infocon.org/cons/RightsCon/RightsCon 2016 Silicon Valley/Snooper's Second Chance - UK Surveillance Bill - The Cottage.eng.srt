thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Peter for that generous</font>

41
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:21,900
introduction and of course um<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think</font>

42
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:24,540
with the allusion to<font color="#E5E5E5"> for decades he was</font>

43
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,520
saying I was old as well I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

44
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,180
didn't slip past to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> keeper anywhere</font>

45
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:33,299
and so I am old and I'm old enough to

46
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:34,680
remember the<font color="#E5E5E5"> history of this and if</font>

47
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,720
you'll forgive me I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk a</font>

48
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,790
bit about the investigative powers bill

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,430
but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think you have to understand it in</font>

50
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,460
context and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the best</font>

51
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,990
place to start is perhaps in 1984 in the

52
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,469
European Court of Human Rights in

53
00:05:45,990 --> 00:05:51,840
Strasbourg which found in a case called

54
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:55,470
Malone against the United Kingdom that

55
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,280
the UK's phone-tapping regime wasn't up

56
00:05:55,470 --> 00:06:01,169
to snuff and fell and was delinquent to

57
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:04,739
international standards of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Human Rights</font>

58
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,880
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> led in 1985 to the government</font>

59
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,340
passing the interception of

60
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,130
communications bill you have to

61
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:15,450
understand that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the UK we have a</font>

62
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:18,450
Gordian knot of legislation practice

63
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:21,120
notes um sort of administrative

64
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,250
regulations and<font color="#CCCCCC"> suchlike which all weave</font>

65
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,280
together and frankly the only people who

66
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:29,070
understand it at all really are the

67
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:30,890
lawyers for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the intelligence</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font>

68
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,960
you might almost think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

69
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:36,690
legislative not a legislative<font color="#E5E5E5"> Gordian</font>

00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:40,159

71
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,280
rather than to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make things clear that</font>

72
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:46,080
interceptions of<font color="#CCCCCC"> communications act led</font>

73
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,289
to another case in the european court of

74
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,340
human rights in 1997 so it lasted about

75
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:57,120
a decade<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a bid and in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> holford against</font>

77
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:02,760
to the in year in the year 2000 the

regulation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of Investigatory Powers bill</font>

00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:10,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">or act which included things like the</font>

00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:14,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">ability to command the mandatory</font>

if you happen to<font color="#E5E5E5"> forget your encryption</font>

83
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:22,500
key so there was those kinds of things

84
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:25,260
which were rather<font color="#E5E5E5"> G nearly included by</font>

85
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,900
the British<font color="#CCCCCC"> government um then of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course</font>

86
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:31,860
we had the Snowden revelations which

87
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:33,719
gave a degree<font color="#CCCCCC"> of clarity to some of the</font>

88
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:36,690
activities that were going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and people</font>

89
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:39,950
then went back and kind of put<font color="#CCCCCC"> the slide</font>

90
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:42,840
rule across<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the behaviors of the</font>

Nigel shine<font color="#E5E5E5"> wold a very senior Mandarin</font>

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,680
in the British government and the other

95
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:59,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">David Anderson QC who was a slightly</font>

96
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:02,970
more independent minded barrister and he

97
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:06,090
reported back on a in a report called a

98
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:10,830
question of trust um that of course led

99
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:13,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> new legislation and that's led us to</font>

100
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,349
the investigative powers bill which has

101
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,960
been introduced into Parliament this

102
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:22,560
year and it will be on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> statute books</font>

103
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,729
by December and there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

104
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:29,190
process of discussions around it they've

105
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:31,950
listened<font color="#CCCCCC"> people but they have ignored</font>

106
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:33,950
them so it's important to<font color="#E5E5E5"> understand</font>

107
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:36,330
that it was also interesting that they

108
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:39,690
divided up those that they consulted

109
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:43,979
with in 23 effectively are the companies

110
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:46,100
who got some very very minor reforms so

111
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically they couldn't be compelled to</font>

112
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:51,140
decrypt stuff that they couldn't decrypt

113
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:54,540
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was the concession to them</font>

114
00:08:51,140 --> 00:09:00,210
then there<font color="#CCCCCC"> was somebody got the irony of</font>

115
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:05,849
that and then there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NGOs and</font>

116
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:08,040
they were put into a group and they were

117
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:10,170
given airtime with very lowly civil

118
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,780
servants and not listen to effectively

119
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:14,760
and then there was the global network

120
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">initiative which I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the independent</font>

121
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:19,470
chair of

122
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:21,209
and we were given some time with some

123
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:23,130
very senior civil servants some of whom

124
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:26,270
are at this conference and have spoken

125
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:29,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">uh so that was quite an interesting</font>

126
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:31,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">istra issue I don't think that the</font>

127
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,590
backdrop to this is also<font color="#E5E5E5"> should one</font>

128
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:38,040
should say that you know both the state

129
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:40,920
and you know privacy campaigners agree

130
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:43,349
about one thing that a comprehensive

131
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:52,890
review and reform is absolutely

132
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:55,110
necessary the so I think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> those the</font>

133
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,990
government has sort of split the data

00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:00,030
into<font color="#CCCCCC"> two communications data which is</font>

135
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:04,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically the mapping of all the</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">whom when you know logs all the rest of</font>

it that information is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be free</font>

142
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:27,180
at all um I'd be interested to hear what

143
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:29,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">the audience thinks about that um oh say</font>

144
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:33,719
a bit louder they<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven't heard that in</font>

those communications what the person's

00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:42,810
actually said or sent and that kind of

148
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,730
thing and there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other</font>

149
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:48,750
powers which are worth picking up

150
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:53,190
communications have to be held for a

151
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:55,050
year irrespective of whether or<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

152
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:56,490
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be looked at so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that on</font>

153
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:01,040
the off chance they may need to look at

154
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:05,010
it interception and reading of

155
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:07,770
communications are approved have to be

156
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,300
approved by a warrant from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the from a</font>

157
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:13,260
politician from the Home Secretary

158
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:14,849
currently<font color="#CCCCCC"> to resume they have put in</font>

159
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,760
place what they call a double lock

160
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:19,680
system so once the politician has said

161
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,600
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to intercept the</font>

162
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,660
communications of a particular

163
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,220
individual or target them then it goes

164
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:29,949
to a former judge or currently sitting

165
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,610
judge it's not

166
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:35,680
yet clear but certainly not sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a</font>

167
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:37,930
capacity as a judge just someone who's

168
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:41,520
sort of got eminent legal qualifications

169
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:44,530
so what they've done is this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

170
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:48,100
sprinkle some judicial fairy dust over

171
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:50,470
the process which says that<font color="#E5E5E5"> once the</font>

172
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:52,660
Home Secretary has made a decision then

173
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:54,520
a judge<font color="#E5E5E5"> will give it a sort of blessing</font>

174
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,689
and the fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> that he's a judge has some</font>

175
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,189
magic powers<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's of course</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

176
00:11:55,690 --> 00:12:00,190
reviewable because he's not sitting as<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

177
00:11:57,190 --> 00:12:03,430
judge she would be reviewable I think

178
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,230
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> only on a judicial review basis that</font>

179
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,500
you know she'd acted so far without her

180
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:10,480
powers that no reasonable person could

181
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:14,460
there's also powers to interfere with

182
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:17,770
computers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack to acquire information</font>

183
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:20,730
and there is also a newly imposed

184
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:22,780
obligation on companies to assist

185
00:12:20,730 --> 00:12:25,750
officially sanctioned hacking operations

186
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:29,829
so the telcos the ICT sector are now

187
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:34,150
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have to actively encourage and</font>

188
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:36,010
assist as opposed to just sit mute and

189
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:39,490
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's the collection of this</font>

190
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:41,230
massive amounts of data but you've got

191
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:43,990
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> have encryption but there's</font>

192
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,030
still this power to compel decryption

193
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:49,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we saw even under the previous</font>

194
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:51,579
regime how powerful that was when a

195
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:53,320
journalist was arrested at Heathrow

196
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,750
Airport whilst carrying data from Russia

197
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to Brazil so I think that's quite</font>

198
00:12:55,750 --> 00:13:03,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting um I just want to say a</font>

199
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:06,430
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things about what is said to</font>

200
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,830
be safeguards there are said to be this

201
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,900
double lock I've spoken about about the

202
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:12,700
politically approved inception which

203
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:16,140
then have to be double looked at by a

204
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:18,040
former judge they're also this

205
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,590
intelligence to commute<font color="#CCCCCC"> security</font>

206

207
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:25,180
the security agencies unfortunately

208
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:28,060
they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> being given a budget that</font>

209
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:30,790
would be necessary or allow them to do

210
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:32,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">that effectively or efficiently but</font>

211
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:35,110
that's part of their role and they've

212
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,120
also got to<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain to the public how</font>

213
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:41,500
the powers in this bill are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

214
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,660
used um it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting that the bill</font>

215
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:47,680
the draft bill has now been

216
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:50,230
viewed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> three external bodies</font>

217
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,579
effectively well to say it's tell one<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

218
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:53,920
the Joint Committee of the House of

eminent informed elected<font color="#CCCCCC"> officials who</font>

00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,950
proposed serious amounts of changes the

Intelligence and Security Committee

<font color="#E5E5E5">security services came up with a</font>

225
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:20,260
significant number I think about 140

226
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:22,420
proposed changes Andrew see the Royal

227
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:25,650
United Services Institute which they

228
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:28,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">give away that it's the services and is</font>

00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:31,810
filled with spies and former spies and

230
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:33,940
they also gave<font color="#CCCCCC"> it some criticisms a</font>

231
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:36,819
couple of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> criticisms which I'd sort</font>

232
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:39,310
of like just tease out as Peter asked

233
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:45,450
was one there's no probable<font color="#E5E5E5"> cause</font>

234
00:14:39,310 --> 00:14:48,459
standard to the judicial approval is

235
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:51,970
absent except at the highest levels and

236
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:54,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">the most intrusive things there's of</font>

237
00:14:51,970 --> 00:14:57,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">course this blanket our data retention</font>

238
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:59,290
without any attempt to justify the

239
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:02,760
proportionality of the invasion<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

240
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:07,209
everybody's privacy without having any

241
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,680
interest in specific individuals and so

242
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:11,910
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> purpose of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this mass surveillance</font>

243
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:16,599
isn't articulated anywhere particularly

244
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:21,430
cleverly and effectively what they've

245
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:24,090
done is that they've gone to take the

246
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:27,280
powers that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I would Snowden revealed</font>

247
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:30,910
were being<font color="#CCCCCC"> used and put them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on a</font>

248
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,980
statutory footing I suspect that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

249
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,569
informed will not have expected<font color="#E5E5E5"> them to</font>

250
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,840
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything else since why they're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

251
00:15:34,570 --> 00:15:40,030
changing even when they had very heavy

252
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:42,970
criticisms and I think that there are

253
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:45,660
some real questions around whether or

254
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:52,170
not this particular<font color="#E5E5E5"> piece of legislation</font>

255
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:55,449
will reach the smell test in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> US when</font>

256
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:57,810
there's a sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> data pooling issue</font>

257
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,330
there is

258
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:03,969
another issue which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should</font>

259
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">just be aware talking about data pooling</font>

260
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,490
is that this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is about interception of</font>

261
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,770
communications and it doesn't affect

262
00:16:09,490 --> 00:16:13,840
data pooling and of course there's no

263
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:15,490
legislative oversight in relation to

264
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:18,100
data pooling and effectively the five

265
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:21,270
eyes are pooling and that's where most

266
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:24,940
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data is coming from so this is</font>

267
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:27,040
<font color="#CCCCCC">very much about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data information washing</font>

268
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,440
being able to get washing of information

269
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,589
or getting information in a form which

270
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:35,080
is presentable to a court and legitimize

271
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,390
so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's part of where we</font>

272
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,460
should go so I would like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind</font>

273
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:41,470
of leave it<font color="#E5E5E5"> there I think I've posed</font>

274
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:42,700
some of the questions that but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

275
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:45,130
others that come out and I'm happy to

276
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:46,920
comment on those as we go yeah thank you

277
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:50,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mark those those were very helpful</font>

278
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">comments i'm going to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduce our</font>

279
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:54,280
other two panelists and also just note

280
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:56,020
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're you're all very</font>

281
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:57,760
likely familiar with slide<font color="#E5E5E5"> o at this</font>

282
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,189
point because you were three days<font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font>

283
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:02,380
the conference but just to remind you

284
00:17:00,190 --> 00:17:04,810
please ask questions through slide-outs

285
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:06,490
the cottage is the room and and we're

286
00:17:04,810 --> 00:17:10,780
you know obviously happy to encourage

287
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,310
participation um so a staleness a is my

288
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:15,550
colleague she worked for access now as

289
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:17,169
well as a jury based in Brussels she's a

290
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:19,209
policy analyst and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> also I have</font>

foundation so I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to I'd like to</font>

294
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:27,790
delve into a bit just some a little bit

295
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:30,190
more<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the substance of the bill and</font>

296
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,800
it's it's obviously very it's very

297
00:17:30,190 --> 00:17:35,950
complex<font color="#E5E5E5"> and convoluted and and we don't</font>

298
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">have time if we focus the entire</font>

299
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:38,800
conference on on the bill we still

300
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,000
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have time time to really</font>

301
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,710
address anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just to highlight a</font>

302
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,470
couple things Danny I know that I know

303
00:17:41,710 --> 00:17:46,600
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of the one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the focuses for</font>

304
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:49,450
for the eff has been this equipment

305
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:51,189
interference which what what is what

306
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:56,950
does<font color="#E5E5E5"> that mean is it interference what</font>

307
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:59,320
does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that mean worth what would be</font>

308
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:01,990
cooled in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States tailored</font>

309
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:04,139
tailored access operations and for

310
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:08,500
almost everybody else it means hacking

311
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,179
and as Mark brilliantly said I feel<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

312
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:12,490
I'm on<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> route of</font>

313
00:18:10,179 --> 00:18:14,649
scizzum about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> British government and</font>

314
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:16,809
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature of law and I'm like halfway</font>

315
00:18:14,649 --> 00:18:21,309
there and Marcus better have had the

316
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:23,168
experience to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go all the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way and so so</font>

317
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,330
my experience was was was halfway

318
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:26,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">through that that story which was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

319
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:30,090
river bill so that was my<font color="#E5E5E5"> first</font>

320
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:33,249
<font color="#CCCCCC">experience of how the British</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

321
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:36,639
attempt to comply with external

322
00:18:33,249 --> 00:18:39,429
requirements for them to write<font color="#CCCCCC"> down what</font>

323
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:41,590
they would I've always do that and the

324
00:18:39,429 --> 00:18:43,179
part of the reason for the existence of

325
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,129
the investigatory powers well it's

326
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:48,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">partly driven by Snowden revelations but</font>

327
00:18:45,129 --> 00:18:50,590
it's partly this idea that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they that the</font>

328
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:54,580
compliance that they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been forced to</font>

329
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:56,709
take essentially requires them to do

330
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:58,360
stuff in accordance with law and so they

331
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:01,210
get to<font color="#E5E5E5"> write the law and as long as it's</font>

332
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:02,860
in accordance with that then they feel

333
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,480
that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> might have a chance of being</font>

334
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:07,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do it without it being instantly</font>

335
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,440
thrown out at<font color="#CCCCCC"> a later stage so equipment</font>

336
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:10,959
interference is kind of interesting

337
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:13,389
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> GCHQ not</font>

338
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,730
only has done for many years<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's</font>

339
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:18,719
it's sort of its its its crowning glory

340
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:21,940
if you look at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Snowden revelations</font>

341
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:23,590
the slides from the NSA describe their

342
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,139
practices and their policies and so

343
00:19:23,590 --> 00:19:27,908
forth are very disturbing and<font color="#CCCCCC"> gchq is</font>

344
00:19:26,139 --> 00:19:29,590
sort of like this younger crazy brother

345
00:19:27,909 --> 00:19:31,269
who's sitting there going we can do

346
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,999
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like well we'll just go out</font>

347
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:37,769
and hack the world and they see this is

348
00:19:33,999 --> 00:19:37,769
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the possibilities that we have</font>

349
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:45,100
what this bill does is not only

350
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:48,369
legitimize and legalize that<font color="#E5E5E5"> practice it</font>

351
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:50,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">also extends it because as soon as you</font>

352
00:19:48,369 --> 00:19:53,168
start describing the powers of the

353
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:56,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">potential of being able to break into a</font>

354
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:59,499
laptop or break into a phone and access

355
00:19:56,529 --> 00:20:01,779
the data that's on it but also transform

356
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:03,490
it into a surveillance device which one

357
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:06,490
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices we have here has a</font>

358
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:08,139
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> microphone has a little camera as</font>

359
00:20:06,490 --> 00:20:10,389
long as that as soon<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you begin to</font>

360
00:20:08,139 --> 00:20:12,758
understand the potential of that almost

361
00:20:10,389 --> 00:20:14,350
anybody in any part of government

362
00:20:12,759 --> 00:20:16,240
realizes that would be tremendously

363
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,609
useful for executing their bureaucratic

364
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,289
or law enforcement function so the first

365
00:20:18,609 --> 00:20:22,918
part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of equipment interference is it's</font>

366
00:20:20,289 --> 00:20:26,639
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just for spies anymore</font>

367
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:28,769
law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> canoes use this the Tax</font>

368
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:32,158
<font color="#CCCCCC">Service can use this and the customs can</font>

369
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:35,690
use this it's also not just limited to

370
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:38,070
the UK of course because the GCHQ's

371
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:39,659
attempted reach was was globally that

372
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:41,970
you could hack into<font color="#CCCCCC"> Reuters you could</font>

373
00:20:39,659 --> 00:20:47,190
steal secrets from Belgium companies and

374
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:49,139
so forth so it's also global it does

375
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:51,359
have this strange sprinkling of

376
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:53,459
compliance which I want to touch into a

377
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:56,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">little bit more but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the real the</font>

378
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:58,529
real poison in this pill for me is that

379
00:20:56,220 --> 00:21:01,499
obviously<font color="#E5E5E5"> law enforcement doesn't have a</font>

380
00:20:58,529 --> 00:21:03,989
special hacking team unless they pay

381
00:21:01,499 --> 00:21:06,450
hacking team the company to do it for

382
00:21:03,989 --> 00:21:10,289
them but they don't have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the built-in</font>

383
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:12,059
capabilities of<font color="#CCCCCC"> GCHQ so what what the</font>

384
00:21:10,289 --> 00:21:14,340
investigator<font color="#E5E5E5"> éclairs bill grant to them</font>

385
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:16,320
is the ability to take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> warrant that</font>

386
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:18,689
they have to hack into a device or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

387
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,658
group of devices we we have these

388
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,789
dematic warrants which you will know in

389
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,739
the declaration of independence as

390
00:21:23,789 --> 00:21:27,539
warrants general these ideas that you

391
00:21:25,739 --> 00:21:30,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">can just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> apply a warrant to a class of</font>

392
00:21:27,539 --> 00:21:32,039
people take those warrants and take them

393
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:35,129
to what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> described in the bills</font>

394
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:37,070
communication service providers and and

395
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:39,029
they will do your hacking for<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

396
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:41,580
communication service providers is

397
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:44,580
described incredibly widely basically if

398
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:46,439
you deal with electromagnetic radiation

399
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,019
in your job you're a communication

400
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,570
service provider and I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

401
00:21:49,019 --> 00:21:53,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">the point and I'm I'm not kidding you at</font>

402
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,080
all this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a joke this was</font>

403
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:57,418
the point when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> were looking through</font>

404
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:58,949
the bill and the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of practice that I</font>

405
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:01,320
turned to my colleague at eff and said

406
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,639
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the drinks out and we SAT</font>

407
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,320
there when we poured a hard drink

408
00:22:02,639 --> 00:22:07,189
because we realized at that point the

409
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,809
communication service provider apply to

410
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:12,720
local Wi-Fi<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it applied to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> library it</font>

411
00:22:09,809 --> 00:22:15,119
would apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the BBC it will apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

412
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,679
anybody who writes a nap it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply</font>

413
00:22:15,119 --> 00:22:18,418
to anybody writing an open source

414
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,460
software like Mozilla it applies to

415
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:22,649
anybody who acts as a conduit<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

416
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:24,690
communications any of those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

417
00:22:22,649 --> 00:22:26,428
be served with this order and be

418
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:29,129
required to not only hack their own

419
00:22:26,429 --> 00:22:31,080
customers by<font color="#E5E5E5"> adapting or changing the</font>

420
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:33,779
capabilities of their software but hack

421
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,629
anyone else there's no there's no

422
00:22:33,779 --> 00:22:38,550
limitation there so to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give an example</font>

423
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:41,100
and this is the example that of course

424
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:45,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">GCHQ actually does and so this is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

425
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,159
it's designed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to allow you can place</font>

426
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:48,929
malware in a watering hole as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

427
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,170
called so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that you would</font>

428
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:54,870
go to an advertising company and say we

429
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:56,820
would like you to deliver malware in a

430
00:22:54,870 --> 00:22:59,969
targeted way because we know you know

431
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,919
who your appetizers are your your

432
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,990
audience are and we would like you to

433
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,640
put malware in your advertising network

434
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:08,070
and distribute it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to this class of</font>

435
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,810
people universally so that's that's

436
00:23:08,070 --> 00:23:12,629

the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ripper bill ross anderson and a</font>

group of really strong advocates managed

461
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:18,590
to squeeze in to the provision that said

462
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:20,639
you must hand over your private keys a

00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:24,150

465
00:24:22,590 --> 00:24:26,820
of this in other parts of the

00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:29,460
investigative powers bill but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

467
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:31,040
in this so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I have a massive set of</font>

468
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,630
concerns of this because basically

469
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:36,960
people here understand and this is why

470
00:24:33,630 --> 00:24:41,910
we all collectively are freaked out to

471
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:44,700
use the local term about a police is FBI

472
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:47,640
we realized that that was a line that we

473
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,010
had to draw because as soon as Apple

474
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:53,880
becomes the agent of the

475
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:56,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">eight everything is is is is literally</font>

00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,140
rewritten the code<font color="#CCCCCC"> is rewritten the</font>

477
00:24:56,070 --> 00:25:00,409
functionality of everything you use is

478
00:24:58,140 --> 00:25:03,240
re-written there is no trust anymore

479
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:05,280
there are plenty of<font color="#E5E5E5"> provisions in the</font>

480
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,070
rest of the bill that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think are</font>

481
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:10,170
incredibly weak arm that basically say

482
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:12,510
if we serve you with a national security

483
00:25:10,170 --> 00:25:14,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">notice if we put a technical</font>

484
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:17,840
capabilities that service notice on you

485
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:20,220
there will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> some element of oversight</font>

486
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:22,439
there's very little oversight in this

487
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,770
and this is where the back doors will

488
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:30,170
happen this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Apple versus FBI and it's</font>

489
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:33,389
already pre written and for every<font color="#CCCCCC"> single</font>

490
00:25:30,170 --> 00:25:34,860
statement by Theresa May and anyone in

491
00:25:33,390 --> 00:25:36,660
this administration that there are no

492
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:38,820
back doors and there are no requirements

493
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:41,130
to decrypt that's because they<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

494
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:45,330
need it this is a this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> back door as</font>

495
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:47,610
big as the entire ICT industry and at

00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:52,139
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> point I stopped reading and started</font>

497
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:57,810
drinking so I'll in that was a very

498
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:01,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">sobering assessment Thank You Estelle so</font>

499
00:25:57,810 --> 00:26:03,960
so part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the the rush to get this bill</font>

500
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:06,659
done according to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the government is that</font>

501
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:07,980
they have this power the date they have

502
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:10,740
data retention powers that are expiring

503
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:12,680
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> December because it was ruled the</font>

504
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:15,540
current powers were ruled not to satisfy

505
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:18,000
domestic and regional human rights

506
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:21,149
standards so now that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're we're</font>

507
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,100
approaching data retention again are we

508
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:26,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">doing it in a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> way that satisfies the</font>

509

courts concerns well worse than<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

510
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,800
actually and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> basically for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> those of</font>

00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:26,809
where some EU countries were rippling

your in your opening remarks but there's

586
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:41,330
a question<font color="#CCCCCC"> on here about about vesting</font>

we're creatures of habit<font color="#E5E5E5"> and as a</font>

00:30:53,870 --> 00:31:02,059

00:30:56,380 --> 00:31:04,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's no effective remedy to say</font>

those grounds but<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going back to the</font>

622
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:20,799
perhaps the the bull point in all of

00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:24,799
this which is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to justify</font>

already put<font color="#CCCCCC"> in his reports that he</font>

there to<font color="#CCCCCC"> report on terrorism and</font>

634

countermeasures for terrorism so<font color="#CCCCCC"> he</font>

635
00:31:55,389 --> 00:32:00,039
doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think it does I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that we</font>

636
00:31:58,149 --> 00:32:02,649
are off to a pretty retrograde start

00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:05,669
start and of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other rather</font>

638
00:32:02,649 --> 00:32:10,299
ironic thing is that the Home Secretary

639
00:32:05,669 --> 00:32:13,389
has to verify that in her opinion that

640
00:32:10,299 --> 00:32:14,860
the piece of<font color="#CCCCCC"> legislation meets human</font>

641
00:32:13,389 --> 00:32:17,320
rights standards so she has already

642
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:19,869
certified to Parliament<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in her</font>

643
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:22,389
opinion this is human rights compliant

644
00:32:19,869 --> 00:32:24,908
and I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know it's not going to</font>

645
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:27,459
take well I won't take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a moron in a</font>

646
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:30,249
hurry to work out<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it hasn't done</font>

647
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:34,299
that um and it will be I think

648
00:32:30,249 --> 00:32:36,100
increasingly unpicked as we go and I

649
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:39,039
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is part of the problem that</font>

650
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:41,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">um the security services have with this</font>

651
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:44,289
bill I don't think they're entirely you

652
00:32:41,379 --> 00:32:46,389
know happy<font color="#CCCCCC"> with what they've got because</font>

653
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:48,610
they want clarity they don't want

654
00:32:46,389 --> 00:32:50,469
lawyers being able to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

655
00:32:48,610 --> 00:32:53,258
systems and expose through court cases

656
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,850
what's going on and so as a consequence

657
00:32:53,259 --> 00:32:57,759
of that they would much prefer to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

658
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:59,860
much clearer operational bill and also

659
00:32:57,759 --> 00:33:01,480
one that works internationally and I

660
00:32:59,860 --> 00:33:03,490
think they are smart enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> realize</font>

661
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,090
this doesn't actually achieve those

662
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,559
objectives I just try to<font color="#CCCCCC"> I agree i think</font>

663
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:11,439
there's a real tension you know there's

664
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:13,539
a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of explanation as to why this is</font>

665
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:15,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">written as broadly as it is and the</font>

666
00:33:13,539 --> 00:33:17,499
standard explanation is well we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

667
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,269
plan for the future right we can't

668
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:22,240
anticipate what technology will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be like</font>

669
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,460
so why don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> we say everything that uses</font>

670
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:25,450
electromagnetic radiation and<font color="#CCCCCC"> and i</font>

671
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,919
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that there's there's an</font>

672
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,929
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've sort of</font>

673
00:33:26,919 --> 00:33:30,970
picked out here in the panel which is

674
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:33,789
there is a life cycle to these bills

675
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,470
these bills start out they start out

676
00:33:33,789 --> 00:33:37,769
broad they get broader in their

677
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:41,019
interpretation so with the Ripper bill

678
00:33:37,769 --> 00:33:41,710
in our most paranoid wonderings we SAT

679
00:33:41,019 --> 00:33:44,679
there are going

680
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:47,409
who does<font color="#CCCCCC"> this apply to and by two years</font>

681
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:48,970
in the surveillance powers in that were

682
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,669
being<font color="#E5E5E5"> used by the milk marketing board</font>

683
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:53,830
and local councils and and then it gets

684
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:55,929
rained in no no I again once again

685
00:33:53,830 --> 00:34:00,789
everything i say is actually literally

686
00:33:55,929 --> 00:34:03,399
true so so this gets rained in again<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

687
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:06,549
then but by that time these powers have

688
00:34:03,399 --> 00:34:09,069
become established and used so one of

689
00:34:06,549 --> 00:34:12,909
the things so the next<font color="#CCCCCC"> bill just</font>

690
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,649
describes current practice one of the

691
00:34:12,909 --> 00:34:16,570
things that it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

692
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:18,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually do encourage people to read not</font>

693
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:19,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">necessarily the bill but the codes of</font>

694
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,260
practice that are associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

695
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:25,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">because they're actually pretty pretty</font>

696
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,730
clear in the sense of that you can look

697
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">at them and go this this is this is</font>

698
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:32,230
excessive but but some of the subtle

699
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:33,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">granularity of it then again I'm going</font>

700
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,990
to dive in on the equipment<font color="#E5E5E5"> appearance</font>

701
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:38,530
so we talked a lot about like the

702
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:40,928
responsibility of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the of the Home</font>

703
00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:42,909
Secretary the politician who gives the

704
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:45,339
stamp and also the sprinkle of

705
00:34:42,909 --> 00:34:49,839
legitimacy so in equipment interference

706
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:51,969
there's actually two forms of order that

707
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:53,619
the Home Secretary signs and one of them

708
00:34:51,969 --> 00:34:56,020
is for law enforcement and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tax</font>

709
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:57,820
office and customs and their powers of

710
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:01,030
equipment interference and in those

711
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:04,720
orders it's actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> listed what the law</font>

712
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:06,339
enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> wants the communication</font>

713
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:09,368
service providers everyone to do and

714
00:35:06,339 --> 00:35:12,040
that spelled out and the Home Secretary

715
00:35:09,369 --> 00:35:13,510
has to determine on a case-by-case basis

716
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:15,970
whether that's necessary and

717
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:19,170
proportionate who decides that the Home

718
00:35:15,970 --> 00:35:22,029
Secretary that's the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the story</font>

719
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:23,800
with the intelligence<font color="#E5E5E5"> services there's a</font>

720
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:26,619
description of<font color="#E5E5E5"> who the target is and why</font>

721
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:28,570
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> being targeted but what the</font>

722
00:35:26,619 --> 00:35:31,450
communication service providers are

723
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:34,119
obliged to do is not described it's

724
00:35:31,450 --> 00:35:36,910

to the three committees and there was a

section that my<font color="#E5E5E5"> colleague Eva galperin</font>

the James Bond stuff and secondly like

798
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:36,070
what will will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> laughed outright like</font>

this will be<font color="#E5E5E5"> people accuses of confusing</font>

services and under the Chatham House

Rules so I won't say probably already

00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:56,140
internal but anyway he described like

805
00:38:54,070 --> 00:38:58,270
our characterization of this is paranoid

806
00:38:56,140 --> 00:39:00,160
and that it would all be clarified when

807
00:38:58,270 --> 00:39:01,750
the codes of practice came out codes of

808

codes of practice that's specifically

810
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:07,060
what they say and they spell out data

811
00:39:05,410 --> 00:39:09,399
protection and they spell out computer

00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:21,730
something I mean I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you've</font>

made<font color="#E5E5E5"> that point incredibly powerfully</font>

820
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:27,220

00:39:24,310 --> 00:39:30,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">course is that the Home Secretary can't</font>

be complying with human rights law when

823
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:34,000
she signs the warrant because she

824
00:39:32,650 --> 00:39:35,859
doesn't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it's going to be used</font>

00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:41,799
of proportionality in her compliance it

827
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:43,839
seems<font color="#E5E5E5"> to me that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's got these</font>

828
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,070
kind of built-in flaws and you know

829
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,990
lawyers are going to be crawling all

830
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:48,490
over this and you know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> those that</font>

834
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:05,650
surveillance in in the EU we have a

835
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:09,220
request to specifically give a numerical

836
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,470
evaluation comparing the UK bill with

837
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:13,359
France Turkey and Russia whether or<font color="#CCCCCC"> not</font>

838
00:40:11,470 --> 00:40:15,879
you're comfortable with with a specific

839
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:17,670
<font color="#CCCCCC">request how do you think this compares</font>

840
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,740
and how<font color="#E5E5E5"> much influence was there in</font>

841
00:40:17,670 --> 00:40:23,410
passing legislation elsewhere then that

842
00:40:20,740 --> 00:40:26,560
provided the coverage for UK to pass

843
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,899
something itself so I'm not really good

844
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,940
at attributing numbers but I can try to

845
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:34,240
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of conversation there um</font>

846
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:35,830
there's a lot of similarities in the

00:40:35,830 --> 00:40:40,450
too wet to the two bills or four if we

849
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:43,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">had the two bills that were passed two</font>

856
00:40:55,869 --> 00:41:00,010
they're similar in the sense that both

of them are trying to put into<font color="#CCCCCC"> a legal</font>

framework a situation that was happening

<font color="#E5E5E5">for a very very long time and a lot of</font>

what has been codified in France where's

861
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,170
the practice and was known and was

revealed by the stone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Revelation and</font>

00:41:11,170 --> 00:41:15,340
they try to legitimize this practice by

00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:16,660
making me below and explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're being</font>

transparent about the fact that we're

doing the surveillance not understanding

867
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:21,730
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the transparency part was not</font>

868
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:25,840
really the issue it was more the fact

869
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:28,720
that it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening then we also have</font>

870
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:30,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">the issue of the actual breadth of that</font>

871
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:34,990
surveillance because both the UK and

872
00:41:30,850 --> 00:41:37,600
France has a big history in having

873
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:40,299
empires in colony and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the</font>

00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:42,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">map of what constitute</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> French</font>

875
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:44,109
territory at the moment a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

876
00:41:42,250 --> 00:41:45,550
are thinking of Paris and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

877
00:41:44,109 --> 00:41:48,430
surroundings but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the map</font>

878
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:50,650
it's actually tons of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Island around the</font>

879
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:52,509
world and you have this international

880
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:54,220
surveillance bill that allow any French

881
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:56,200
authority to taps into undersea cable

882
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:57,910
buy things for its territories and if

883
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,220
you're considering the alum that France

884
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,140
owned in front of the United States in

885
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:04,000
the territory that<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs own in Latin</font>

886
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:06,640
America the numerous island that France

887
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:08,680
owned around India the ones in Africa

888
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,650
the one in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pacific's it's actually</font>

889
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:13,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">very big and it's not only surveillance</font>

890
00:42:11,650 --> 00:42:15,070
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> France and around France but it's but</font>

891
00:42:13,510 --> 00:42:17,590
its global surveillance in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

892
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:19,000
situation apply to the UK so when we're

893
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:20,800
talking about surveillance in UK and

894
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:23,260
France you have to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about global</font>

895
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,230
surveillance as well I mean being an old

896
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:28,270
rock and roller I think that to use an

897
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:30,630
analogy they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> just turned the Marshall</font>

898
00:42:28,270 --> 00:42:37,859
amps up to 11 um

899
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:39,509
I i I'm glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> that Estelle raised the</font>

900
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:42,328
question of undersea cables because I

901
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:44,460
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the big blind spot that</font>

902
00:42:42,329 --> 00:42:45,710
nobody's looking at because<font color="#E5E5E5"> suddenly</font>

903
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,390
they're saying they're all

904
00:42:45,710 --> 00:42:49,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">extraterrestrial um the question asks</font>

905
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:52,769
you know how does<font color="#E5E5E5"> this rank with Russia</font>

906
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:58,529
I used to<font color="#E5E5E5"> live and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> work in the Soviet</font>

907
00:42:52,769 --> 00:43:01,319
Union<font color="#E5E5E5"> and a lot of the people who I came</font>

908
00:42:58,529 --> 00:43:05,250
to know from the KGB now cunningly

909
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:07,920
renamed FSB you know they had<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

910
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:11,339
capabilities that we've got there just

911
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,190
less obvious about it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't i think</font>

912
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:17,519
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically they're in we're in</font>

913
00:43:14,190 --> 00:43:20,490
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same bracket as Russia China the</font>

914
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:23,008
United States what you're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a</font>

915
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:26,089
quick glimpse under the petticoats of

916
00:43:23,009 --> 00:43:28,380
what the government can actually achieve

917
00:43:26,089 --> 00:43:35,250
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to move to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a question from</font>

918
00:43:28,380 --> 00:43:38,849
the audience thanks my battery is dead

919
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:40,710
um so I you know I sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of appreciate in</font>

920
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:43,019
one sense that the UK is trying to

921
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:46,109
comply with the the legality principle

922
00:43:43,019 --> 00:43:48,240
but you know the legality principal says

923
00:43:46,109 --> 00:43:49,710
you know not only that government action

924
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,089
has to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> established in law but that</font>

925
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,359
that law has to comply with

926
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:55,470
international human rights standards and

927
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:57,180
you know this relates a little bit to

928
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,890
another question here and it's

929
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,019
interesting to see how the UK has

930
00:43:58,890 --> 00:44:02,430
reacted over the years<font color="#E5E5E5"> to decisions of</font>

931
00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:04,618
the European Court of Human Rights and

932
00:44:02,430 --> 00:44:08,399
amended its you know surveillance powers

933
00:44:04,619 --> 00:44:09,809
accordingly but now you know the UK has

934
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,970
called the Human Rights Act into

935
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:13,170
question you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's debated I think</font>

936
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:15,058
withdrawing from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> European Convention</font>

937
00:44:13,170 --> 00:44:18,900
on Human Rights it's possibly

938
00:44:15,059 --> 00:44:21,029
withdrawing from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the European Union how</font>

939
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:22,529
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see that element the you know the</font>

940
00:44:21,029 --> 00:44:25,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">International Human Rights the</font>

941
00:44:22,529 --> 00:44:28,619
international legal order playing into

942
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,230
the debate around<font color="#E5E5E5"> this bill I mean I</font>

943
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:34,140
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that if the current government has</font>

944
00:44:31,230 --> 00:44:36,900
its way it will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> out of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the European</font>

945
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:38,339
Convention on Human Rights the argument

946
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:41,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">is that there's absolutely no difference</font>

947
00:44:38,339 --> 00:44:44,230
between<font color="#E5E5E5"> English human rights and those</font>

948
00:44:41,069 --> 00:44:48,820
Johnny Foreigner ones across the channel

949
00:44:44,230 --> 00:44:50,859
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think in reality the British</font>

950
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:52,359
government will be far more restrictive

951
00:44:50,859 --> 00:44:54,520
in the way in<font color="#E5E5E5"> which they interpret them</font>

952
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:56,920
the British courts will be far more

953
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:59,530
reticent about striking down legislation

954
00:44:56,920 --> 00:45:03,100
particularly when the government utters

955
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:04,900
the words national security we all know

956
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:08,170
how courts are very fawning in those

957
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:10,690
circumstances and not at all careful or

958
00:45:08,170 --> 00:45:13,690
diligent in their scrutiny so I think

959
00:45:10,690 --> 00:45:16,450
there really are problems on a sort of

960
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:18,310
practical level it's quite clear<font color="#CCCCCC"> to me</font>

961
00:45:16,450 --> 00:45:22,089
that the cooperation that we're seeing

962
00:45:18,310 --> 00:45:24,190
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europol to combat terrorism the</font>

963
00:45:22,090 --> 00:45:28,570
intelligence sharing that kind of thing

964
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:32,280
is operationally pretty good and that

965
00:45:28,570 --> 00:45:32,280
will continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the share</font>
