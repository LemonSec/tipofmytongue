00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:03,520

but also a poet a performance poet i'm

6
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,119
the founder of sarira gaza poetry in the

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:17,680
streets

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,520
i perform on metro stations in narrow

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,519
lanes and market places

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,359
on roads and crossings and

11
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,039
on ferries on top of the ocean um

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
i started performing uh in public spaces

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,920
to subvert

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,160
the margins that are created in these

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,280
public spaces

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,399
and also primarily because cases of mob

17
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,800
lynchings of valids and muslims and

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,320
trans people in india was growing to an

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,920
unprecedented number

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
it was getting very close home and

21
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:52,960
became

22
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,879
essential to rewrite

23
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:59,280
narratives in public spaces if they

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,960
could spill blood

25
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,000
if they could spread hatred on roads

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,280
it was my duty to go out there

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,760
and spread love and sing songs of

28
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
resistance and

29
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,439
tell poems about um revolution

30
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:18,479
in those very streets uh so i won't

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:21,040
take much time i'm going to start with

32
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,159
the first poem

33
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,439
it is an anti-war poem i wrote it when i

34
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:26,159
was

35
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,439
in i think my undergrad i wrote it

36
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:30,400
because

37
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,920
i remember one army general of a certain

38
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,880
country had come out and announced that

39
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,600
they are now going to have biodegradable

40
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,479
bullets

41
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
being used for war and draining the

42
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,600
bullets

43
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:46,720
will plant themselves in the soil

44
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
and flowers will grow out and

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
it was bizarre it was a bizarre

46
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
idea and that is why i wrote this poem

47
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,439
it is called

48
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,919
letter jasmine pro there too

49
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,240
so the army of a place whose people

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,520
have unlearned love again

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,520
wants to create bullets that plant

52
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,080
flowers where they fall

53
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,239
what a beautiful idea is it not

54
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,040
what a peace loving thoughtful gesture

55
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,160
to re-flower

56
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,200
the places whose flowers you

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,800
have destroyed there will be flowers

58
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,720
inside and ground and papua

59
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,800
and everywhere that bullets are dropped

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,360
in american school rooms and gay clubs

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,840
and violent classes in palestine

62
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,160
in a nursery in lahore and the streets

63
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,200
in kashmir

64
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
in the forests of chhattisgarh and

65
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,920
valleys of the northeast

66
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
where the bullets are dropped flowers

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,200
will grow

68
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,560
in the deserted concrete floor i bet

69
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,040
i bet you have thought of exotic colors

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,800
that you want the flowers to flaunt

71
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,519
tanager

72
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,319
tuberose yarrow lobelia mesclun

73
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,000
jacaranda

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,200
species of orchids roses and those that

75
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,200
have unpronounceable

76
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
biological names will now grow and be

77
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
reaped by the scarlet

78
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,959
blood of those whose bodies

79
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,400
will recompose even before

80
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
your biodegradable bullet shells what an

81
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,560
idea

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,000
to unplug the unriped unblossomed bloods

83
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,879
of the local

84
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,760
glatella so your flower seeds could be

85
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,799
dispersed

86
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,360
it will justify all the bullets that

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,959
you've ever fired

88
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,640
no one no one will ask you about

89
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,959
fallen buildings of aleppo but applaud

90
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:42,480
you for the new

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,400
beautification process no one no one

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
will utter a word on how many strains

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,640
turned red in kashmir but the aesthetic

94
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:53,280
garden

95
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,200
you planted right next to the tulips

96
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,439
will not go unnoticed we

97
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,560
we will understand your message of love

98
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,439
the father will make sure that a bullet

99
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:08,239
shell is

100
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,000
planted on the head side of his

101
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,640
daughter's grave

102
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,040
i would want you to sprinkle these

103
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,238
bullets into the sea

104
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,478
so that they implant themselves in the

105
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:22,400
decomposing bodies of those who embraced

106
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,000
the sea to escape

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,120
my being is like barren land

108
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,160
a conflict zone

109
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,759
my being is like barren land a conflict

110
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,720
zone

111
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,000
please fire a bullet into my

112
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,360
heart and let a jasmine

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,919
grow there too and let a jasmine

114
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:56,479
grow there too

115
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,000
the second poem is um

116
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,360
something that i wrote when we were

117
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,039
sitting in protest last year

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,919
against the citizenship laws that my

119
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:10,000
country had just passed

120
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,039
it was it seemed like a direct attack on

121
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,400
my community and we were grieving and so

122
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,080
you realize that when your entire

123
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,039
community is pushed against the wall

124
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,360
when you are discriminated against

125
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,840
because of your identity

126
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:28,240
that is fighting that is your only

127
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,360
priority

128
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,479
then heartbreak romantic love

129
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,919
all personal grief takes

130
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:38,960
a back seat and that's when i wrote this

131
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:39,440
and it

132
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,880
and and i've seen a lot of fellow actors

133
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,120
face this struggle this this

134
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,400
prioritizing of personal grief and

135
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,199
trauma

136
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,280
over collective grief and collective

137
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:52,720
resistance and

138
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
um so this poem i wrote in urdu

139
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,720
initially it's called

140
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,120
um i can't be a lover right now i'm

141
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,960
going to translate as well

142
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,160
it goes like this i can't be a lover

143
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,840
right now

144
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:04,610
[Music]

145
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:06,400
i can't be a lover right now no

146
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,879
i cannot write poems for you my brown

147
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,759
eyed lover

148
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,199
not when my ink boils with anger my pen

149
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,720
refuses to write anything but freedom

150
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,160
no i can't be a lover right now because

151
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,599
petitions need more blood than love

152
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:24,800
letters

153
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,800
and i need to hold hands with women of

154
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,879
shaheen bhag and khan

155
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,199
instead of entangling my fingers with

156
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:31,919
yours

157
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:35,360
no i can't be a lover right now because

158
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,440
my nights are spent protesting

159
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,559
in the cold and i cannot

160
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:44,480
afford to exchange it with the warmth of

161
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,240
your embrace

162
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,360
no i can't be a lover right now and

163
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,279
mourn your departure because it's not

164
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,240
just my heart

165
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,080
that is at risk for my very existence

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,760
no i can't be a lover with with bloody

167
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,399
marks on my back swollen toes empty

168
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:03,120
stomach

169
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,640
no i can't be your lover right now

170
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,920
probably because grief has a right time

171
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,360
every grief has a right time an apt

172
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
moment and right now i am grieving

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,480
that the death

174
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,440
the approaching death of my existence my

175
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,399
vajud

176
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,880
no i can't be a lover right now

177
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,399
my brown knight lover i can't

178
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,839
be a lover right now

179
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,360
the next poem is something that i wrote

180
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,519
during my college during my university

181
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,120
days when

182
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,240
we had different few hours

183
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,000
boys and girls and there's a lot of

184
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,519
discrimination on campus and

185
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,080
a movement was started i was also part

186
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,120
of that movement

187
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,040
and it was called break cages and

188
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,440
started off as a feminist movement it

189
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:06,800
was an anti-fascist

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,040
anti-carciss anti-communalism

191
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,240
movement and i

192
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,399
met some really inspirational women

193
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:17,920
while being a part of that while

194
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:18,720
protesting

195
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,720
while dancing on the streets and i

196
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,600
learned through that movement how to

197
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,480
celebrate our resistance and how to form

198
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,240
a community

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,399
and so this poem is also in urdu and

200
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,480
it's a performance poem but uh

201
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,800
i'm going to read out the translation

202
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,519
and it goes like this

203
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,680
it is about it is dedicated to the women

204
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,880
who came before me

205
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,200
the women who went short that i am

206
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,519
articulate enough to assert

207
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,560
and it is a tribute to all of them and

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,720
it goes like this

209
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,320
today i will tell stories of my

210
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,200
shamelessness

211
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,440
today i will tell stories of my

212
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
shamelessness

213
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,120
and the shamelessness of thousands of

214
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:01,600
women

215
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,600
the locks of whose schedules are getting

216
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,880
stronger by the day

217
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,320
you who have further

218
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,959
tightened the existing ropes around our

219
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,600
throat

220
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,399
you who have taken our freedom in a free

221
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:15,360
country

222
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,839
you who have kept the knights to

223
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:18,959
yourselves

224
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,000
and evicted us from the ownership of the

225
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:22,880
dark

226
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:26,640
skies who refused to share the treasures

227
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,079
the stars and the galaxies had to offer

228
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:31,600
when we asked

229
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
you read out the long chapters from the

230
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,959
books of honor

231
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,160
and security on instances when we tried

232
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,720
to take it on our own

233
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,160
we couldn't manage to return home

234
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:47,839
you you who have changed our feet

235
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,160
who have chained our feet and built

236
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,519
walls of culture

237
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,639
religion civilization nationalism

238
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:57,920
around our being you who stand guard

239
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,600
with conditioned minds

240
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,800
ignoring our very existence

241
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,600
at my doorstep and draw lines that can

242
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,959
never be crossed you

243
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,519
shout and press hard you force and try

244
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:10,639
new methods

245
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,600
to cage us down and silence us and you

246
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,560
thought

247
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,519
and you thought that we yes we would

248
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:18,639
bowed heads

249
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,920
year after year century after century

250
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:24,399
school after school neighborhoods after

251
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,360
neighborhoods

252
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,079
country after country nation after

253
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:28,639
nation

254
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
will wear your chains as if they were

255
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,800
anklets

256
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
we will take your ropes to be beautiful

257
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,639
necklaces

258
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:39,360
red lipstick will shine atop the locks

259
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,760
you've put on our tongues and we

260
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,079
will dance to the rhythms of your

261
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,040
oppression

262
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,639
no no no no no no history

263
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,680
has seen days

264
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,560
the history has seen days when women

265
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,120
have come

266
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,160
down as lightning and destroyed your

267
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,120
forests of oppression and misogyny your

268
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,600
imposed standards of sexuality

269
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,800
and parameters of honor and shame we

270
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,680
have broken locks and dismantled prison

271
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:18,560
bars

272
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,880
and the battle continues every day

273
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
we will turn every dagger into pens that

274
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,519
will write

275
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,240
ropes will be transformed into anklets

276
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,839
and then

277
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,639
we will dance on the chest of the world

278
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:34,959
on

279
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:37,600
roads markets and homes and fraud as

280
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,399
gatherings

281
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,639
libraries and universities and

282
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,000
parliaments and

283
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,279
senates and then and then you

284
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:47,120
you would have nothing to do but stare

285
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
at us unemployed as you've been

286
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,120
dismissed from the job of guarding our

287
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:52,560
bodies

288
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,600
you can now sit on stools of patriarchy

289
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,000
and fascism and wait for a bro brigade

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,880
who will arrive

291
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,920
soon and apply the ointment of honor and

292
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,639
the wounds

293
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,040
of your patriarchy

294
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,760
while you judge our characters through

295
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:10,720
our clothes

296
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,720
and we we are witches and granddaughters

297
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:14,959
of

298
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:18,560
shameless women who will keep walking

299
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:22,000
never surrendering breaking cages recrea

300
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:26,240
reclaiming the nights eating the stars

301
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,519
and we we are witches and granddaughters

302
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:30,480
of shameless

303
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,430
women

304
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:36,019
[Music]

305
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,079
who will keep walking never surrendering

306
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,360
breaking cages

307
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,880
reclaiming the nights eating the stars

308
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,399
while the moon adorns our forehead

309
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,839
or chand hamare mater

310
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
bindi banter champa

311
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:59,839
or chan hamade mata

312
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
and so i this is going to be my last

313
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,320
poem it

314
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:09,839
is about hope and every day

315
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:12,079
i have struggled to keep we have

316
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,000
struggled to keep hope alive

317
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,040
uh but as we say uh hope is what leads

318
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:17,680
the world

319
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,560
and so this is the poem inspired by the

320
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,040
nisha lamarris's poem on hope

321
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,839
it is

322
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:31,839
it goes like this

323
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,839
every morning

324
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,680
every morning when i wake up my ribs are

325
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,040
heavy

326
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,240
i carry within them two plants

327
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
one is that of hope and the other of

328
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,880
hopelessness and days are water one

329
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,920
on most days the other but that is the

330
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,040
thing about hope

331
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,440
it isn't a feeling it isn't a month

332
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,600
right isn't just the efforts our face

333
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,000
muscles take to round our lips and say

334
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,279
oh and let it fall at the drop of

335
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,959
pea hope hope is labor

336
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:16,000
hard work resistance it is a sit-in

337
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,639
protest against hopelessness

338
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,920
hope does not just smile it is grief and

339
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,800
prayers it is

340
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,079
placards and that song on loops slogans

341
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,839
on the streets and hula hoop

342
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,240
to the right beats it is picking up

343
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,440
rubble

344
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,240
undead bodies from burns streets and

345
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,199
scribbling

346
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,800
ideas on you sheets sometimes hope

347
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,320
seems to be a privilege but the whole

348
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
plant within my ribs wants to fight all

349
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,680
odds and hope still that on the other

350
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,240
side we will come out more compassionate

351
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,279
kind

352
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,399
dismantling systems of marginalization

353
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,839
more love and safe spaces more calm and

354
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,240
less

355
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,680
races in inclusive work spaces cleaner

356
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,399
air

357
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:04,799
and cleaner hearts original news and

358
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,959
crater starts

359
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,919
the plant of hope has climbed my neck

360
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:10,240
and

361
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,280
ribs and reached out to my ears

362
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:19,839
just to whisper inshallah

363
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,000
and with this i want to thank the access

364
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,039
now and

365
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:28,160
rightscon team for having me here and

366
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,960
all of you for listening to these

367
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
poems which might not be that important

368
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,880
but

369
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,520
it definitely can

370
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,120
hinder hope even if in even if it is

371
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,280
in one person's heart it would mean the

372
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,320
world

373
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,280
um to me so if you have any questions

374
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,559

375
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:56,720
