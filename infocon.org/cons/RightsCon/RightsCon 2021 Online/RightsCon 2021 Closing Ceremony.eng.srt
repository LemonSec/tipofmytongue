9
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:49,840
not gonna lie i think

10
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,239
wright's gone is always super intense

11
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:54,000
but the whole of access time

12
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,960
now team i think uh would probably kill

13
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,239
us if we were uh

14
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,120
putting a motion to extend rightscon

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,239
well that is that is

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,720
an implied shout out to the rightscom

17
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,400
team which has been amazing and the rest

18
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,840
of the accessnow team who has been

19
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,560
working

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,080
crazy for this event right of course and

21
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,040
so

22
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,799
maybe you can share with us what has

23
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,119
been one of the highlights of uh

24
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,560
the summit for you well it's been a

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,400
very exciting conference a very

26
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
interesting conference

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,320
a lot of learning always i'm never tired

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
of of all the

29
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
the you know the big spectrum of

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,720
learning that we have but if i have to

31
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,079
pick a favorite i would say that the

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:33,759
social hours with the little tables that

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:34,400
you could just

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,200
jump around and meet new people were

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,159
very very cool

36
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,320
i mean i really like that that interface

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,240
uh you know civil society connecting

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,920
with funders connecting with the private

39
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,119
sector i think that is

40
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,880
amazing it's like a mini reproduction of

41
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,320
the hallway experience

42
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,000
uh that we always have in the in-person

43
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
event that was great and

44
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,920
what about you what's your highlight i

45
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,759
was gonna say the social hours too maybe

46
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,719
we should have uh

47
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:00,159
synced up before but no uh honestly me i

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,920
felt challenged i think there were a

49
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,640
number of

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,360
uh panels and strategic sessions that

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,320
i've attended

52
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,399
that were really solution oriented it

53
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:09,598
wasn't just about

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,760
debating about the ideas but really

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,360
trying to

56
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:15,360
to find solutions and realistic

57
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,520
solutions and i really appreciated

58
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
uh that aspect like it wasn't too

59
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
pessimistic

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
uh but it was sometimes like a bit like

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,280
hardcore realistic uh and i guess that

62
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
was a good summary of my

63
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,640
of my experience this year but um

64
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
what i'm super excited about as well is

65
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,480
this closing ceremony and what we have

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:39,200

intense week

we're coming to a close and uh

82
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:20,400
i feel really good about the discussions

83
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
that we've had

84
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,120
i'm not really sure where the last five

85
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:25,040
days have gone i'm

86
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,120
totally honest i feel like i've how many

87
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,720
hours i've been sitting in front of this

88
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,760
screen

89
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,159
um in and out of panels and community

90
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,480
labs and strategic round tables

91
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
um i want to pay a special tribute to

92
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
the person who

93
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
joined the dark patterns panel um whilst

94
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,480
on a treadmill

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,040
shout out to whoever you are but but

96
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,799
seriously i also want to note all those

97
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,080
people who joined

98
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,760
um with the rights con grant i think

99
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,680
there are 151 of you

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,760
who came with a stipend um provided by

101
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,799
the conference

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,080
and for cost like data and others costs

103
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,680
and expenses that are attached to

104
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,439
um participating in rightscon so

105
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,200
hopefully that worked out well

106
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,920
it's the second time we've done that um

107
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,840
but it's not just been five

108
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,120
five days of mind expanding sessions and

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,040
challenges and new concepts and old

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,478
struggles it's also i think

111
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:20,079
important to hold space for the 18

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,918
months of crisis that

113
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,960
really has befallen so many of us and i

114
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
want to acknowledge the issues of

115
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,080
digital authoritarianism that's been

116
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,520
discussed so much during the week and

117
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
crumbling democracies and

118
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,560
intensification of state power and the

119
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
like

120
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,600
you know which is the lived experience

121
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,160
of so many on the line i think

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,080
some of you know that we run a digital

123
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,919
rights executive directors meeting every

124
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,000
year

125
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,800
we just had it today we had about 45

126
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,400
executive directors from around the

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:48,800
world

128
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,479
meeting to talk about the issues that

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,400
we're facing as organizations at civil

130
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,440
society

131
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
and i want to actually bring up um three

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:00,080
um amazing members of civil society

133
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,440
um benga and maryam and xiaowei

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,759
if you guys could all wave would be

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:06,880
great

136
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,560
now that we're here on screen um

137
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,880
and i'd actually before we begin this

138
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,240
discussion and i'm not calling it a

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,759
panel because it's not a panel because

140
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,280
we've already had 530 of them uh

141
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,639
to to just take a moment um

142
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,120
like mosey did yesterday in her session

143
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,840
before she kicked off and just

144
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,240
had a second of just calm and a second

145
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,080
of just breath

146
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,400
because it has been an intense five days

147
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,360
but it's been an

148
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:37,039
even more intense 18 months as i

149
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,800
mentioned and i think

150
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,639
it's important just to hold space for a

151
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,880
sec

152
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,479
so we actually deliberately invited you

153
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,280
three

154
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,280
um intentionally invited you three

155
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,280
people might know that we actually began

156
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,199
rightscon with a multi-stakeholder panel

157
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:58,800
which had a representative of

158
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
civil society and the corporate sector

159
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,560
and of government

160
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,400
but we've actually have three

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
representatives of civil society

162
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,240
for the closing and nikki and i did that

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,759
because

164
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,280
um we wanted to make sure that

165
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,479
that that rights con which actually is

166
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:17,840
the civil society

167
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,080
space it's a civil society owned space

168
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,960
and it's a civil society owned

169
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:23,759
multi-stakeholder space in the sense

170
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,720
that

171
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,120
it we invite governments and companies

172
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
and other stakeholders

173
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,280
into our environment and i think it's

174
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,120
only fitting therefore that we actually

175
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,600
close and conclude these five days

176
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,120
with three representatives of civil

177
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
society

178
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:39,840
the other thing that i want to say just

179
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,919
before we kick off is that i would be

180
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,560
really good

181
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,759
in the opening we talked about the first

182
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,400
um about the 10 years of writing on the

183
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,479
10 year anniversary

184
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,639
and in a sense we look back and we look

185
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:53,759
to the present

186
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,000
in our closing discussion i'd like to

187
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,800
talk about

188
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,880
the next decade i'd like to think i'd

189
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
like you three to think

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
more about what's coming to prepare

191
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,280
us as civil society and as the all the

192
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,800
other stakeholders who are here as to

193
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,639
what you think is going to happen over

194
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,520
this

195
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,000
this period to think prophetically so

196
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
bengal if it's okay i'm going to start

197
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
with you

198
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,599
you've been in this game for a number of

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,360
years and

200
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,199
we've kind of grown grey together

201
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,720
although it looks like i've gone greater

202
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,400
than you to be honest

203
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,160
um you've seen the evolution

204
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
you've seen the evolution of digital

205
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,440
rights um

206
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,800
you know from your own country including

207
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,520
the

208
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,000
one of multiple crises that are

209
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,520
happening on the continent with respect

210
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,599
to twitter and

211
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,120
um and and and

212
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
and and so i guess my question for you

213
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,879
is like what does the

214
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:53,199
current situation that you find yourself

215
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:53,919
in

216
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,759
and your country and in fact your

217
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,440
continent and although obviously it's a

218
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,680
recall to ask about the whole content

219
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,800
but what does that your current

220
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,199
situation portend for the future

221
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
and and and what's your thinking on

222
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,800
what's to come

223
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,280
thanks brett uh thanks for hosting this

224
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:13,840
and

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,479
thanks to the entire access now team and

226
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,639
you know to everyone making this happen

227
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,280
uh like you said it's been you know an

228
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,479
interesting

229
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,000
few days in nigeria specifically because

230
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,120
you know ironically we actually just

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
you know a few days uh you know before

232
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,039
the announcement by the

233
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,159
governments that they were going to

234
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,880
suspend twitter we are just wrapped up

235
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,839
on shooting

236
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,080
a 2020 one short film based on our 2020

237
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,560
uh arnold reported paradigm on digital

238
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,440
rights on the

239
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,160
continent and the things we talked about

240
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
included shutdowns you know

241
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,880
lack of access government overreach and

242
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,320
things like that

243
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
and so when that happened you know it

244
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
became something within the team that we

245
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
said okay you know what we were ready

246
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,240
for this

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,120
and i think what is important though is

248
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,680
to say

249
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,440
that you know the suspension on twitter

250
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
in nigeria

251
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,600
and many activities like that that we've

252
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,519
seen by governments either in uganda or

253
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,440
ethiopia anywhere else on the continent

254
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,760
is not just about you know in this case

255
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,680
twitter or social media

256
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,279
it is actually a continuation of what is

257
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,920
you know a clamp down agenda uh a

258
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,200
closure of you know civic spaces

259
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,519
and and the challenge with that uh you

260
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:30,959
know speaking about the next few years

261
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:31,519
my

262
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
some of the concerns that i have include

263
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,120
the fact that we're now beginning to see

264
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,000
retroactive

265
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,560
laws that have been used to justify you

266
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,080
know on democratic actions

267
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,480
so basically uh if you talk about

268
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,920
actions by government

269
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,480
uh as being on democratic then you check

270
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,080
the books and you find that

271
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,920
they're actually making excuses for them

272
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,440
in the books like nigerian government

273
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,480
announcing

274
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,440
that you know otts now have to register

275
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,160
and then

276
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,760
taking that instead of going to

277
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,839
parliament to have a reports debate

278
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,640
uh they're sort of escaping that and

279
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,160
making announcements through

280
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
our agency of government and and i you

281
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:08,240
know also sort of

282
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,640
get i'm really concerned about you know

283
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,000
not just governments

284
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,160
uh but also the platforms themselves uh

285
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,360
in terms of context

286
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,600
you know i saw you tweet by access now

287
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:19,120
earlier today that i retweeted

288
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,839
about how social media our facebook was

289
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:22,560
muting

290
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,040
you know the voices of palestinians and

291
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,399
and i thought you know it's important

292
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:27,519
for us not just

293
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,959
to talk about you know the worries about

294
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,959
what governments are doing but also the

295
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,399
need for platforms

296
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
uh and other stakeholders to understand

297
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,839
context and not

298
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,079
you know contribute to the problems that

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:40,240
are on the ground but it's it's not all

300
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,200
blue

301
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,839
for me when i look at the next uh say 10

302
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,120
years i'm actually

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,440
you're more optimistic about the next 10

304
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,560
years uh

305
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,600
than than you know than have concerns i

306
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,640
know for a fact

307
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,120
you know that yes the you know the clash

308
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,640
we're seeing between

309
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,880
say you know someone has described it

310
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,279
nation states and cloud nations will get

311
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:02,320
more intense

312
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,320
but the good news is that the citizens

313
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
the people will win

314
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,279
because there will be pressure on one

315
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,720
side on government

316
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,640
there will be pressure on the other side

317
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,160
on cloud nations

318
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,839
and we will have a scenario where

319
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,600
citizens begin to call out governments

320
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,200
regardless of where they are

321
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,760
um you know in the global south or if

322
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,200
you're acting as a dictator you will be

323
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,320
called up by citizens

324
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,760
if you're in a global north and you

325
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,200
claim that you're you know your

326
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:26,320
democracy

327
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
that is also calling out other people

328
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,920
you will be called to question

329
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,680
uh you know scenarios where we have you

330
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,000
know julian assange or edward snowden

331
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
being uh you know you know been

332
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:40,560
handled in their own countries or by

333
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,320
you know countries like the u.s and

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
others and then the same countries like

335
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,240
the us then says to other countries

336
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,680
that you know what you guys should do

337
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,440
better that kind of hypocrisy

338
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,920
i'm sure we will see that go yield down

339
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,839
over the next few years because we will

340
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:54,399
have

341
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,120
you know push back by citizens and and

342
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,760
for me

343
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,839
i think that you know one other

344
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:00,959
optimistic thing

345
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,760
is we will see that you know the bit is

346
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,680
beginning to come up about platforms

347
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
versus protocols you know while we were

348
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,839
chatting earlier i said that my

349
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,040
background in engineering

350
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
really gets me excited about this time

351
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,880
uh because unfortunately

352
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,800
because we have platforms that are

353
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,639
driven by commercial value

354
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,240
uh we do not have you know that interest

355
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,440
where they're focusing more on providing

356
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,240
solutions

357
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:28,639
and building around norms but they're

358
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,480
focused a lot more on profit but i

359
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,839
believe that will change

360
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,639
as that conversation continues but the

361
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,320
most exciting thing for me

362
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,440
is the fact that the more repression we

363
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,079
see

364
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
the more citizens are learning what to

365
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,480
do on how to push back

366
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,440
when governments shut down people learn

367
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,079
about

368
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
vpns and things they never really knew

369
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
anything about so i think over the next

370
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,639
10 years

371
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,639
we have a major opportunity at civil

372
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,120
society to take advantage of

373
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,240
every clampdown as opportunities to

374
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,360
create awareness

375
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,519
about tools not just for circumvention

376
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,279
but also to empower citizens

377
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,480
to push back so that the new normal

378
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,240
does not become a situation where

379
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,000
governments clamp down and people keep

380
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,440
quiet so brett i'm

381
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,680
excited about the next 10 years i know

382
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
things are really tough right now

383
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,440
but i'm glad that we're sort of

384
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,120
developing our wings to fly better

385
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:28,240
thanks benga um you know i think that

386
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,200
that

387
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,440
the situation is very mixed as you say

388
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:32,240
and and

389
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,079
i i love the way that you kind of are

390
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
framing a negative and turning it into

391
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:39,120
a positive in the sense that you know

392
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,000
we're seeing this

393
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,639
extraordinary consolidation of state

394
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:43,199
power

395
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:45,320
um thanks for bringing up the idea of

396
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,680
retrospective legislation

397
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,760
uh as well in order to legitimize the

398
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,519
power of the state and we're seeing that

399
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:54,079
across the world really and just look

400
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:54,800
what's happening

401
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,160
in india for example with this like

402
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,560
state of new legislative developments

403
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,040
that

404
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,279
trying to re-authorize and reauthorize

405
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,000
the state's power

406
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,279
i i also

407
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:10,639
believe that this idea of

408
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,399
civil society connections civil society

409
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:15,040
cross

410
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,959
country across nation learning

411
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,519
and is essential we're seeing as you

412
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,199
mentioned with shutdowns the way in

413
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:23,760
which

414
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,480
civil society organizations are using

415
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,639
precedent in one country is the basis of

416
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:29,440
the

417
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,920
positioning and power in another country

418
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:32,800
uh

419
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,959
and and and and so um with that maybe i

420
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:37,279
should

421
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,079
hand over to to mariam to have a

422
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,120
discussion

423
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:44,240
um about her perspective on this because

424
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,320
similarly the sich the current situation

425
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,040
does not look great

426
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,160
and i know as a palestinian activist and

427
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:52,560
this

428
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,920
issue has been on the agenda very much

429
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,279
all week and all month and obviously for

430
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,240
many years

431
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,399
um but as a palestinian activist you

432
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,360
know you've

433
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,600
i've seen you on cnn i've seen you

434
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,680
reported in the guardian and on a range

435
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,360
of different platforms

436
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,120
and you have a really good understanding

437
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,279
of the situation

438
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:16,000
of technology of colonialism of

439
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,279
oppression in fact even

440
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,040
you know twitter's come up a few times

441
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,880
already but your account your own

442
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,720
account was restricted in

443
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:25,839
in may of this year so tell us mariam

444
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:26,480
about

445
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
your perspective on where you think

446
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,839
power will lie

447
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,839
um you know is it going to be in the

448
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,120
hands of

449
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,120
of governments will it be in the hands

450
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,160
of companies or

451
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,160
as bengal kind of pointed to do you

452
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,639
think that we as citizens will be able

453
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:43,040
to re-exercise

454
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,199
our digital rights with some level of

455
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,680
dignity

456
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:52,079
um well thank you first of all brett um

457
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:52,959
and my fellow

458
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:55,839
panelists who i see all of us kind of

459
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,480
nodding

460
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,560
at certain instances at the same time

461
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,759
just because

462
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:02,480
the experiences of a lot of the

463
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,000
repression we're seeing i think

464
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,120
resonates across um the globe

465
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:12,160
excuse me and for for me

466
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,199
being based in palestine i was able to

467
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:17,839
see the tangible repercussions

468
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:20,839
of how things like social media

469
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:22,240
platforms

470
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,480
can impact our daily lives can impact

471
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,680
the extent

472
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:30,240
of violence we see and

473
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,720
participate and what i've been saying is

474
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,480
social media platforms that have been

475
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,279
censoring palestinians trying to report

476
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
and show their testimonies of the

477
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,000
violence from israeli settlers here

478
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,279
is aiding and abetting apartheid and

479
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:47,360
persecution it is not

480
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,639
mere censorship and i really think it's

481
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,880
so important that we are having these

482
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,880
conversations now that we continue to

483
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:55,680
have them

484
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,720
as a first step to kind of highlight the

485
00:16:58,720 --> 00:16:59,279
gaps

486
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:02,000
or the opportunities there are to to

487
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
grow and develop

488
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,799
a lot of what i've seen on social media

489
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:10,559
is the way we've been using it was

490
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,359
um to mirror our realities on the ground

491
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,520
to kind of extend and reflect

492
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,880
that violence that the colonial ethnic

493
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
cleansing the apartheid

494
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,400
um and that they're very uh it's it's

495
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:24,720
just

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,839
brutal brutal uh slaughter of of

497
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,919
palestinians like we saw in research

498
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:30,480
which was

499
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
carpet bombed um is that we look at it

500
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,400
as

501
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,640
mirroring the reality but these

502
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:39,280
conversations are showing how

503
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
these um these these corporations and

504
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,200
companies and platforms can also

505
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,080
shape it that right now i think

506
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,320
presently across the globe

507
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:54,400
we are seeing how transparency can take

508
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,640
so many different levels accountability

509
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,919
can take so many different

510
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,480
levels and that everyone has a role to

511
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,760
play so

512
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:05,120
when you ask me brett um who do i see

513
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:05,679
kind of

514
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,880
the the centralization of power and

515
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,760
i see people calling for checks and

516
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,880
balances where

517
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,520
there is more of a decentralization that

518
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
as long as you have

519
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,039
transparency and you have accountability

520
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:20,799
um and policies

521
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,520
that are clearly um created to be

522
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,840
implemented at the human rights level

523
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,840
well then it's really the question is

524
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
less about that and more about how can

525
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,480
we make

526
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:33,000
this happen how can we ensure more

527
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,400
transparency

528
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,400
of what kind of pressures people are

529
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
facing to kind of delete tweets

530
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:42,640
or why accounts are being suspended

531
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:45,440
such as mine when i was tweeting out

532
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,120
updates from on the ground

533
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,000
in palestine as the israeli army was

534
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,960
firing at

535
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,080
unarmed palestinian protesters

536
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:55,919
my account was suspended and i was under

537
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,360
the impression that

538
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
you know our words are at least getting

539
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,360
out that sure we're being shot down but

540
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,240
at least

541
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,559
we get an echo and then i find out that

542
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,160
none of um

543
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
my my tweets and updates from the ground

544
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,919
were shown that they were censored but

545
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:13,520
what's worse is that

546
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,919
the answer to that was i'm sorry it was

547
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,840
an accident and it was reinstated by

548
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,799
twitter

549
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,160
and if we are having accidents

550
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,760
quote unquote at this frequency then

551
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,440
there are things that really need to be

552
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
worked on so let's unpack this let's

553
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:29,840
have

554
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,000
real and true transparency because i

555
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
think right now

556
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,679
there's an opportunity to set the bar

557
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,720
higher in terms of justice in terms of

558
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
accountability in terms of preserving

559
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,000
human rights

560
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,000
rather than trying to understand

561
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,360
um the the ways of which this is

562
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
obstructed let us recreate it

563
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,760
and i think the social media platforms

564
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
ahead of us the technology

565
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,799
that is growing around us is a testament

566
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,559
of how much we can do when we imagine

567
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,520
different ways so this is also an

568
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,320
imagination

569
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,200
um if i might i might just follow up

570
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:13,919
thanks for you

571
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,280
for your comments and um

572
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,400
you know there's a lot of

573
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,280
focus right here on on social media

574
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,120
companies which i think is right

575
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,039
but i think it's also important that we

576
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,320
think about

577
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,880
the fact that every company over this

578
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,080
next 10 years will

579
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,080
essentially become a tech company it

580
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,000
doesn't matter what they're selling

581
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,360
and we've seen you know um

582
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,080
cosmetic companies are now you know

583
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:43,360
selling facial recognition

584
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,720
like you know who would have thought

585
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,640
that l'oreal would have been

586
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,840
engaged in in this so we need to

587
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,440
i think a civil society we need to

588
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,919
expand our scope as well

589
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,919
it's not just about expression now we're

590
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,200
talking about

591
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:00,240
opinion association privacy information

592
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,200
but across um the spectrum from civil

593
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,880
and political rights through to economic

594
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,000
social and cultural rights as

595
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,240
was discussed i think in the the panel

596
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,360
with the special rapporteur and the

597
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,360
secretary general uh yesterday

598
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,559
of amnesty international and so

599
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
you also touch on the issue of

600
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
transparency which is great

601
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,480
um and also implementation of

602
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,919
transparent policies

603
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,240
you know that we're actually as you say

604
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,440
setting up the bar

605
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,760
higher and ensuring that that bar is

606
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,039
actually implemented

607
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,760
um you know as a floor as opposed to as

608
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,200
a ceiling so

609
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,520
very much appreciate uh very much

610
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,799
appreciate that

611
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,080
and and and is there

612
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
like when you think about civil society

613
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,080
and its role

614
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,600
in kind of setting that bar or enforcing

615
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,200
you know the level of where that bar is

616
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,919
set like how do you see us

617
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,880
activating like how do you see us in a

618
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:55,280
way

619
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,679
taking what bengal said which is like

620
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,440
situation and then turning it into a

621
00:21:59,440 --> 00:21:59,919
positive

622
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:01,840
so we're actually spreading our wings

623
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:03,280
and learning how to fly when the next

624
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:06,320
situation happens

625
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,320
and i think that's an excellent question

626
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,880
and i think a lot of the solutions

627
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,919
are within the problem right we are

628
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:15,440
finally able to name

629
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,679
a lot of these problems that we other

630
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:18,799
wise couldn't

631
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:20,799
um and now we are also moving towards

632
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,400
solutions so for you know

633
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,600
palestinians um in terms of the

634
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,840
the censorship i'm going to go back to

635
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,799
this as an example

636
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,520
example on social media showed that

637
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,400
there's

638
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,799
no real understanding within these tech

639
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,480
companies that they are not really

640
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,280
investing in

641
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,480
researchers that can show you the word

642
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
martyr should not be flagged as

643
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,520
incitement and censored martyr means

644
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,559
a person who was killed by the israeli

645
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,559
army by this colonial power

646
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,880
but more than this martyr in its

647
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,679
linguistic

648
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,880
form means to bear witness um

649
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,280
so those that were killed are those that

650
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:00,640
are witnessing

651
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,679
water so it's it's looking at it at the

652
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,760
very micro level it is empowering the

653
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
employees to speak out when they see

654
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,520
a corporate policy that violates human

655
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,480
rights

656
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,000
so we need to ask ourselves on that

657
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,720
level as well it is

658
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:20,080
sharing digital rights um platforms it

659
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:20,559
is

660
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:23,840
simplifying these uh terms that we all

661
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,640
have to kind of

662
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,240
sign up for at the end that no one

663
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,400
really reads let's actually give people

664
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,679
access to information

665
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,080
instead of hiding it behind kind of the

666
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:32,880
jargon

667
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,520
of the words let's simplify and i think

668
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,000
more than

669
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,799
anything what this current period showed

670
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,640
us is just how intelligent we are

671
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,440
as people and how quickly we can learn

672
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,919
things

673
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,320
about um different sectors that we

674
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,600
otherwise didn't

675
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,640
so let's also trust people

676
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,200
in their knowledge in their intelligence

677
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,400
and then their right to access

678
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,840
information

679
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,039
and actually give it to them

680
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,919
thank you so much i'm really encouraging

681
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
to hear and i also just want to

682
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,320
shout out to as i did in the opening

683
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,240
there are 500 tech companies that have

684
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,640
been

685
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,679
uh at ricecon over this week and you

686
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,760
know representatives from

687
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,640
twitter that have sat down with uh

688
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,799
representatives of civil society

689
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:21,679
i think it's a learning exercise in many

690
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,400
of the

691
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,240
companies as well i think there is

692
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,520
actually

693
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,559
quite a lot of goodwill and a lot of

694
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,520
thinking about how to improve the

695
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:33,039
situation

696
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,600
we also need to make sure of course that

697
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,279
the companies that are not here

698
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,080
are engaged in this discussion because

699
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,760
when we think about that evolution of

700
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
technology over the next 10 years we are

701
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,919
and now we're talking about facial

702
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,919
recognition we're talking about digital

703
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:48,880
identity

704
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
and we're talking about biometric

705
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,880
tracking and biometric surveillance in

706
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,240
in public spaces

707
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,720
um and these matters are absolutely

708
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,919
relevant i think

709
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:01,600
um to our next um speaker xiaowei

710
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:02,799
it's great to have you here and thanks

711
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,720
so much for joining us you

712
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,840
actually have got really significant

713
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,559
insights

714
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:12,480
into uh into china and china is actually

715
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,679
you know when we think about the next

716
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,320
decade i'm interested in your thoughts

717
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,000
about

718
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,520
you know is this going to be china's

719
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,840
internet decade um you know expand

720
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,840
exporting of assets infrastructure and

721
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,279
digital policy

722
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:27,919
through to you know bengals region uh

723
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:29,840
and to mariam's region and

724
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
and actually in standard setting bodies

725
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:32,960
and so on

726
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,440
um you know you've written an

727
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,200
extraordinary book blockchain chicken

728
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,880
farm and other stories of tech in

729
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,720
china's countryside which has

730
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:44,640
been reported widely and i think

731
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,640
you know sort of addressing this idea of

732
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:48,559
storytelling as well and how do we

733
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:48,960
actually

734
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,279
tell stories and narratives about what

735
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,000
we see

736
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,320
and being prophetic about what we expect

737
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,120
to see and

738
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,279
also what we hope to see so let me hand

739
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,159
over to you and let's have your thoughts

740
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,760
thank you so much and thank you to

741
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,080
everyone at writescon and access now for

742
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:04,799
having me

743
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:08,320
and the other panelists um

744
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,360
yeah i think that's the question of the

745
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,720
next decade in china

746
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,880
brings up a lot of really interesting

747
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,320
themes one

748
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,360
is this idea that it might be the end of

749
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:20,159
the west

750
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,640
and that it's china's rise and then

751
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,880
another common theme really is this

752
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:28,480
fear of china's rise and i think within

753
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,960
fear

754
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,720
there's also this notion of safety and

755
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,559
so something that's on my mind

756
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,240
for the next 10 years is how do state

757
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:36,960
actors

758
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:39,679
define safety and security and how do

759
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,799
they co-opt

760
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,760
this narrative you know when i think

761
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,400
about

762
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
china right now and especially biometric

763
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,000
surveillance

764
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,159
and widespread oppression especially

765
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:52,640
against the uyghur muslim population in

766
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,640
xinjiang

767
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:57,600
these human rights abuses are you know

768
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,880
really enabled

769
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,360
by technological surveillance like that

770
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,400
region has

771
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,760
uh this like next level um

772
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,000
id cards that have retina and

773
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,919
fingerprint scans

774
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
um and so really though

775
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
this kind of you know the state actors

776
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,039
there are saying that

777
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:18,960
you know this surveillance is out of

778
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,240
public safety

779
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,919
and so i think this question of how

780
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,360
we're defining safety

781
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
at the state level versus really on the

782
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,000
ground is going to become crucial

783
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,159
even outside china when i think about

784
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:31,600
things like

785
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:34,159
covid you know public safety and

786
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,279
tracking

787
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,320
issues like that i think

788
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:42,240
another issue about the kind of u.s

789
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,039
china relations this kind of tech cold

790
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
war narrative

791
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,559
there's also a lot embedded in there and

792
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,919
especially the differing

793
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,440
levels of power um so you know i

794
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,000
think about the heartbreaking

795
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,039
circumstances of xinjiang

796
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,760
a lot and it's also you know i'm

797
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,159
currently in the bay area i think about

798
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,919
uh you know what is to be done and

799
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:11,279
for within you know u.s china politics

800
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,640
there's this attempt

801
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,360
at policy at the governmental level to

802
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,080
really change

803
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,279
things but then you have tech companies

804
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:21,120
kind of off to the side and they're

805
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
really banking on

806
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,840
nationalism and deregulation and

807
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
that's kind of resulting in this new set

808
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,360
landscape

809
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,559
of kind of non-collaborative

810
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,919
non-cross-culturally collaborative

811
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:38,720
set of ai ethics not to mention many of

812
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,240
these tech companies have

813
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:44,000
global supply chains global talent

814
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,559
and it's really actually a kind of

815
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:48,640
global level issue

816
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,919
so the cold war rhetoric is you know

817
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,399
really serving a specific class of

818
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:55,600
people

819
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:58,159
i think i will say have a lot of

820
00:28:58,159 --> 00:28:59,440
optimism though

821
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,880
um so when i think about

822
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,640
there was a session earlier where this

823
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,559
researcher julian posada

824
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:09,679
mentioned ethics from below and so when

825
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,960
workers at tech companies or in

826
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,559
data training companies they start to

827
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,679
you know really make change i just

828
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:20,240
finished

829
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:23,279
stewarding this place logic school which

830
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:24,159
is

831
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:27,600
for tech workers not just engineers but

832
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,240
also gig workers platform workers

833
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,919
to really think through how they might

834
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,000
bring organizing and activism

835
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,600
into their companies and i it was really

836
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
inspiring

837
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,080
and truly powerful to see a group

838
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,440
of you know 20 folks from some of the

839
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,960
biggest tech companies

840
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,080
to gig workers start to

841
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,200
really actively organize and make change

842
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
and so i feel very inspired by that

843
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
thank you thanks so much for your

844
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,760
comments i i want to pick up on a couple

845
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,840
of them and maybe we can get all four

846
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,480
screens uh up on the big screen because

847
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,360
i think that

848
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,559
um we'll finish up shortly because i

849
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:14,080
conscious that we um you know that we've

850
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,520
all been here for a long week

851
00:30:15,520 --> 00:30:18,960
uh but i do want to just uh pick up on a

852
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,240
few things that you said and then maybe

853
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,600
we can have a little group discussion

854
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,520
and then we'll hand over to the

855
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,760
extraordinary nikki gladstone to

856
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,559
to bring us home on this issue of safety

857
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,640
and security and how it's defined by

858
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
both the state and also by

859
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,559
by companies and how when i look at the

860
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,559
digital security helpline that accessnow

861
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,360
right has

862
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,159
runs and we've just put out our latest

863
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:42,799
report

864
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,279
on you know 10 000 cases we've done 10

865
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,399
000 cases

866
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,159
and then sort of the difference between

867
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:50,720
digital security and safety and

868
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,559
national security and safety and

869
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,799
national and cyber security in a sense

870
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:55,840
the way that the state

871
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,159
understands it and how those two things

872
00:30:58,159 --> 00:30:59,039
uh

873
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:02,240
are really um um you know almost

874
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,840
speaking different languages certainly

875
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:05,200
speaking different languages if you look

876
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,600
at

877
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:09,120
for instance on on on internet shutdowns

878
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,279
you know the number one reason that is

879
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:12,799
actually given for

880
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,640
for shutdowns is around public safety

881
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,279
but actually the way that we see it is

882
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,559
that it's actually about the right to

883
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,159
peaceful protest

884
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,720
and and and governments are uh

885
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,519
deliberately

886
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,640
mischaracterizing citizen voices

887
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,480
on exercising the right to peaceful

888
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,840
protest and talking

889
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,760
and shutting down the internet because

890
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,120
they're seeing it as an

891
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,679
as an affront to to their own authority

892
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:40,240
um

893
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,360
rather than expression of citizen will

894
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
i also wanted to touch on this idea of

895
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:47,200
the tech cold war

896
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,679
which is not just between china and the

897
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:50,320
us but

898
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,480
actually is in this next decade i think

899
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,679
there's going to be a further

900
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,200
intensification

901
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,240
as states you know try to

902
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,559
bring digital sovereignty back into

903
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,080
their purview so that they're putting

904
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,159
the data centers within the country

905
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:07,440
and so on um and you know it's really a

906
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:09,519
tectonic shift of this geopolitical

907
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:10,720
development between

908
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,880
you know the borderless internet and

909
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:14,240
powers trying to

910
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,000
research control and of course have

911
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:18,240
supremacy in the digital age

912
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,360
and in terms of diplomacy and control so

913
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:24,480
um um but you're positive as well

914
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,519
and i think that that is so pleasant

915
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,240
um and probably that's the wrong word

916
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,559
but it's inspiring and it's engaging

917
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,960
and i i want to pay tribute to to you

918
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,799
three but i also want to pay tribute to

919
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,159
all of the other civil society

920
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,039
representatives

921
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,519
who are here at wright's con and those

922
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:43,039
who haven't made it to rights gone

923
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:45,039
who are battling you know so many of

924
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,240
these forces i

925
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,679
and so i guess my last my question

926
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,720
is um

927
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,799
you know what is your message to civil

928
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,559
society that could actually

929
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,559
take us through with confidence and to

930
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,159
share that inspiration that you guys

931
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:00,720
have

932
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,679
and when they're faced with a new law

933
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,080
and their coalition is being built and a

934
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,919
laws being you know read and second

935
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,200
reading speech into parliament in the

936
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,000
first time you've seen

937
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,279
it on biometrics what can you what can

938
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:14,559
you convey to them

939
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:18,240
about the pathway that they should take

940
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,640
um i i personally was listening to an

941
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,519
extraordinary panel with

942
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:26,559
marwa and waffe and um

943
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,120
and another uh woman from the from the

944
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,600
menu

945
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,480
region and they're all so inspiring in

946
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:33,679
the way that they have

947
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:36,640
facing you know real life harms um but

948
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,640
are yet so powerful and engaged with

949
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,000
their work so

950
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,120
um benga can i jump to you first

951
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,960
um and if you'd like to comment on any

952
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,159
of your previous

953
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,039
discussants uh comments please feel

954
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,720
uh free right um

955
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,320
i'm glad we're having this conversation

956
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,080
and i'm glad that we're not you know

957
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,360
leaving this place

958
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,480
uh you know feeling sad uh because to be

959
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,200
honest a

960
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,480
lot is going on uh but but maybe

961
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,639
three quick things for me that civil

962
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,239
society can learn

963
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,280
uh as we navigate our way through the

964
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,839
complexities

965
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:16,159
uh you know to towards solutions and

966
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,359
towards better

967
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,119
uh scenarios i think number one for me

968
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,639
to keep records

969
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,199
keep records um and i think this is

970
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,639
important because

971
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,280
if we don't document history we won't

972
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:28,399
learn from it

973
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:31,040
and it becomes very easy for governments

974
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
and other actors

975
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,639
to change the narrative practical

976
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:35,359
example

977
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:38,639
october 2020 young nigerians

978
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,280
went on the streets to protest police

979
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,399
brutality

980
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,520
the president spoke yesterday and said

981
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:47,599
that remember those young people who

982
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,839
wanted to come to abuja to remove me

983
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:52,399
and literally wanted to change the

984
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:53,199
narrative

985
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,719
that those young people who were

986
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
speaking about police police brutality

987
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,880
were basically about regime change and

988
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,160
were literally criminals

989
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,880
so we have to keep records i think the

990
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,000
second thing

991
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:06,400
is to also and i know we say this a lot

992
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,320
or to begin to do it to work across

993
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,040
silos

994
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:11,440
there is so much knowledge within civil

995
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,320
society

996
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:15,119
about technical issues about historical

997
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:16,160
facts

998
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,240
one country has gone through what you're

999
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
going through before

1000
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,760
so the more we reach across silos the

1001
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,760
more we're able to exchange knowledge

1002
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,839
and work together uh and i think the

1003
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,760
thought which i've learned a lot over

1004
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,280
the last 18 months

1005
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,560
is to when we're on our campaigns to

1006
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,680
look for

1007
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:36,160
friends within the comms we're

1008
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:37,119
campaigning

1009
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:39,200
uh against their actions within

1010
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,240
government

1011
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:43,520
within platforms and within other actors

1012
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,599
that we believe need to do better

1013
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,520
because reality is that many times

1014
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,560
those on the inside need our actions and

1015
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,520
need our support

1016
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:53,440
to make those changes happen so i think

1017
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:54,800
with these three things

1018
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,359
uh we may have a chance you know we

1019
00:35:57,359 --> 00:35:58,640
document history

1020
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:01,280
we reach across silos and we work with

1021
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,079
people

1022
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:05,280
uh who are able to up amplify what we're

1023
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,000
saying

1024
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:10,079
and get them to the level of action

1025
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,280
such sage advice thank you wenger and

1026
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:15,359
and i agree that this you know when you

1027
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:16,560
put those three things together

1028
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,320
actually when i think about the

1029
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,880
victories that civil society has had and

1030
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:22,400
actually i heard one of the panels

1031
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,720
a woman from india who's an advocate and

1032
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:26,400
she's like

1033
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,680
i've never actually won a case

1034
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,359
but there's been a number of learnings

1035
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:33,119
in all of the cases digital rights cases

1036
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,480
that i've been engaging and we've had

1037
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:35,680
micro wins

1038
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:39,440
but but i do think that that the the

1039
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,920
when we do win it's when we actually

1040
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:42,640
work

1041
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,839
with ourselves a civil society

1042
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,760
and then with champions within

1043
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,680
government and within the tech sector

1044
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,280
and they do exist it's that

1045
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:53,359
it's that multi-stakeholder campaigning

1046
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:54,880
that i think has been our most

1047
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,160
successful strategy

1048
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,520
and we're never going to be able to go

1049
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,200
it alone as you say we need to work

1050
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,160
across silos

1051
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,079
but not just across silos within the

1052
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,000
human rights community but across silos

1053
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,960
within

1054
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,119
all sectors um mariam for you

1055
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:12,240
um reflections

1056
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,520
i i'm so appreciative of all the

1057
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:16,720
panelists and just

1058
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,359
the narratives and the testimony and

1059
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:21,040
that's one of the things i i

1060
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:23,920
do want to also emphasize is that

1061
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,520
document it all

1062
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,599
um these are testimonies these are

1063
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,359
evidence piles

1064
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
these are going to help us get

1065
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,119
accountability but this isn't just about

1066
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,599
the

1067
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,560
ethnic cleansing i face as a palestinian

1068
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:38,960
this isn't just about

1069
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,359
any of the violence even in nigeria or

1070
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,400
in kashmir or in bahrain or in the us

1071
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,079
it is also about the violations

1072
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:48,079
happening from these tech companies so

1073
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,720
let us document those now as well

1074
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,079
um for the future more than this

1075
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,200
is yes this usually happens in other

1076
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,119
places before it comes home

1077
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,800
so let us look at what is happening

1078
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,240
today because they will set the

1079
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,119
precedent

1080
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,680
for the future if we continue being

1081
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,720
censored we will be used as a precedent

1082
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:11,760
for policymakers to continue that if we

1083
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:12,960
call it out

1084
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,680
if civil society calls it out and calls

1085
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,000
it by its name and calls it clearly then

1086
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,599
we will set a precedent

1087
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:22,960
for future wins as well

1088
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,760
and more than this is to continue using

1089
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,359
these spaces

1090
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,040
as as places to re-imagine

1091
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,040
and dream together one of the hashtags

1092
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,480
palestinians used was

1093
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,960
as if it was free and for the first time

1094
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:44,160
here in palestine and in diaspora i was

1095
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,880
able to dream with palestinians

1096
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,960
despite being fragmented so it's

1097
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,000
important to

1098
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,280
for civil society to take up these

1099
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,040
spaces and demand that right as well

1100
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,560
to come together thank you

1101
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,839
i i really um i i love what you said

1102
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:06,480
about precedence setting because i feel

1103
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:07,920
as though

1104
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,960
we're in this norm creation stage and if

1105
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
norms get created

1106
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,000
without our precedent if norms have been

1107
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:17,200
created

1108
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,839
you know in multilateral bodies where

1109
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,760
civil society has been excluded

1110
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:25,119
then um you know it forms the basis of

1111
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,119
practice going forward and because we

1112
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,960
are in this norm setting stage on so

1113
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,320
many issues

1114
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,320
like if you look at the norms around you

1115
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,839
know around ai

1116
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,760
um which are happening developed in

1117
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,839
europe uh similarly in europe on the

1118
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,200
digital services act

1119
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:40,640
you know it's all these norms that are

1120
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,560
being said and they're actually

1121
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,560
they're really just precedent for future

1122
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:46,400
actions and future activities

1123
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:49,839
and if we get the norms wrong um

1124
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:52,640
we get we we lose the possibility for

1125
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:54,640
social justice and for

1126
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,280
human rights implementation um so thanks

1127
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,400
a lot for raising that

1128
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,440
let me hand lastly to xiaowei

1129
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:05,200
and let's have your perspective on

1130
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:09,119
thoughts advice reflections for civil

1131
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,079
society going

1132
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:14,000
forward yeah i think to echo something

1133
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,560
that benga said earlier about protocols

1134
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,359
i think especially the engagement of

1135
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:20,640
civil society both

1136
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:23,760
on you know issues of policy but also on

1137
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,000
the

1138
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,960
protocols and the standards building

1139
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:27,760
both

1140
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:32,079
you know on a technical level but also

1141
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,280
thinking internationally feels very

1142
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,079
important

1143
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:38,960
and i think two another thing that i

1144
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:39,920
would touch upon

1145
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,520
is this idea of change and visibility

1146
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:46,480
and just because you can't see it

1147
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,240
doesn't mean it's not happening and

1148
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,440
there's so many

1149
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,560
um you know differing levels of push

1150
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:53,920
and change that's happening and

1151
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:56,480
oftentimes the movements that you can't

1152
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,880
see

1153
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:58,720
well you can't see them for a reason

1154
00:40:58,720 --> 00:40:59,920
sometimes you have to keep it

1155
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:00,720
underground

1156
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,000
um and yeah this is like very much

1157
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,440
coming out of

1158
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:08,560
thinking through the workers at these

1159
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,240
tech companies who are building change

1160
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,520
from the inside

1161
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,000
it maybe can't be visible yet but it's

1162
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:16,480
happening

1163
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:22,000
yeah absolutely and and you know let's

1164
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,119
pay tribute to

1165
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:25,280
to people on the inside and many of

1166
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:26,960
those people on the inside actually

1167
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,280
here at bridescon as well they're here

1168
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,440
to learn and to hear directly from the

1169
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,720
voices and expressions of um of

1170
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,720
civil society and of individuals who are

1171
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,079
working on the front line

1172
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:39,920
and while we're at it and more

1173
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:41,359
importantly let's pay tribute to those

1174
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,040
people who are on the front line uh

1175
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:43,520
again

1176
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:46,000
many of whom who are here i talked about

1177
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,079
rights kind of the beginning of this

1178
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:51,359
um at the beginning of the conference um

1179
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:52,960
you know it feels like three months ago

1180
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,480
but it was five days ago

1181
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,079
well i talked about um you know about

1182
00:41:58,079 --> 00:41:59,680
civil society

1183
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,800
um being able to feel like they have a

1184
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,880
place which is home

1185
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,359
and i hope that rightscon can continue

1186
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:08,560
to be that place

1187
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,400
where people feel comfortable and being

1188
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,319
able to have these discussions

1189
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:14,960
um i've the last point that i would like

1190
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:16,400
to make just in terms of the next 10

1191
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,200
years

1192
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,720
is the fact that we're going to have

1193
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,960
another billion or two billion people

1194
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,440
join the internet community and i think

1195
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,040
that provides us with a

1196
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:27,920
huge amount of opportunity and hope

1197
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:28,720
because

1198
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:31,520
this is a whole new generation of young

1199
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,040
people who are entering into our

1200
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,760
community

1201
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,079
but also people who are being brought

1202
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:36,800
into

1203
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:39,839
connectivity of all generations because

1204
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:40,160
of

1205
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,240
you know new broadband new mobile

1206
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,599
technologies etc

1207
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:46,480
and i just hope that we can welcome them

1208
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:47,680
into a

1209
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:50,400
secure and open and interoperable and

1210
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,200
safe internet that they can be part of

1211
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,880
and that they can shape because as we

1212
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,880
know and the thing that the real reason

1213
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,040
for writing which is where we started

1214
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:00,960
which is how do we ensure that we're

1215
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
able to exercise our human rights

1216
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,440
in the digital environment in the

1217
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,200
digital era and we're right at that

1218
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,319
precipice now

1219
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,119
so with that thank you so much to the

1220
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:13,440
three of you for being on the panel with

1221
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:13,920
me

1222
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,640
and for being such awesome superstars

1223
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:17,760
you really like

1224
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,640
give us hope i think for an inspiration

1225
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:21,119
to

1226
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:23,680
to to be able to navigate what i think i

1227
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:25,280
think ben you said is like

1228
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,680
difficult waters or choppy waters or you

1229
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,839
know whichever whatever the

1230
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,800
the the weather it is that it's going to

1231
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:33,920
be before us but

1232
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:35,760
it is going to be choppy and it is going

1233
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,200
to be turbulent

1234
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,640
and but i think when we have leaders

1235
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,280
such as yourselves to help guide us and

1236
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,280
to be part of our community then we

1237
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:45,280
should be we should do well and we

1238
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,800
and we should do safely and we should do

1239
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,440
happily and i think as i said like

1240
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,520
in the opening like don't panic we're on

1241
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:52,800
it so with that

1242
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,240
uh let me hand over to uh to nikki

1243

1275

the final number of registered

1276
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,359
participants

1277
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,040
were able to find a sense of community

1278
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:06,560
at writescon

1279
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,240
we're already seeing the results of our

1280
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,319
connecting and coordinating too

1281
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,319
we're seeing coalitions strengthened and

1282
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,720
started petitions initiatives and

1283
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,160
reports launched

1284
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:19,280
and also toolkits created uh and i'm

1285
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:20,400
sure that there are many more that we

1286
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,760
don't even know about yet

1287
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,359
um so i invite you to share them in the

1288
00:45:23,359 --> 00:45:25,200
chat if you have outcomes

1289
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,960
and also email them to us because i know

1290
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:29,920
you know how to get in touch with us

1291
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,760
um i think that these tangible

1292
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,119
demonstrations

1293
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,400
are really an illustration of the power

1294
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,240
of convening even in the face of

1295
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,319
continuous disruptions to our civic

1296
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:41,760
spaces

1297
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:43,520
they really make me hopeful for the

1298
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,200
decade ahead

1299
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,280
speaking of convening i'm sure many of

1300
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:49,040
you are wondering what our plans are for

1301
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,880
2022

1302
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,400
and we're still doing a lot of work to

1303
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,000
understand what a return to in person

1304
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:54,880
might look like

1305
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,680
and when that might be possible and

1306
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:59,359
we're really hoping that you will all be

1307
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,040
a part of shaping that understanding by

1308
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,960
taking our survey which is now available

1309
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,640
on the home page of the platform and

1310
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,640
sharing your experience

1311
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:08,400
with this year telling us what we can do

1312
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:09,839
better and what you loved about

1313
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:11,040
writescon

1314
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,640
but also sharing with us your vision for

1315
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,280
next year so i i really hope everyone

1316
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,280
will just take a moment or two to fill

1317
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,560
out that survey

1318
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:21,040
um and as always any decision that we

1319
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:21,920
make about where

1320
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,359
rightscon comes together will be

1321
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:25,280
grounded in our commitment to

1322
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,599
hosting a summit that is as accessible

1323
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:30,160
and inclusive to a global community as

1324
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:30,800
possible

1325
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:34,079

join in person so that i think is very

1353
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:32,000
very exciting

1354
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,480
and uh i think that we should go for a

1355
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,319
place that we own that

1356
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:38,319
you know that is a note for convening

1357
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,400
and that is a tool for change that's how

1358
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:41,040
i see it

1359
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,599
how do you see it for the future yes

1360
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:45,520
something very similar and it's very

1361
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:46,240
interesting

1362
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,800
because you mentioned uh inclusion and

1363
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,559
earlier i was reading

1364
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:53,599
um that when we talk about inclusion

1365
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,920
we very often uh consider the

1366
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,040
representation

1367
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,200
aspect an enlarging representation which

1368
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,040
i think has been

1369
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:03,760
really good at but we not always talk

1370
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:05,200
about the power

1371
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:08,800
uh uh impact and and the the power

1372
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,800
dimension of the inclusion and i think

1373
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:12,000
this is something that i would really

1374
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:12,960
want to

1375
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,200
to see manifested at write con we talk a

1376
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,520
lot about civil society and sometimes

1377
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,200
the imbalance between

1378
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,440
states and and companies and civil

1379
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:23,280
society and i would really want

1380
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:26,640
us to feel like we have power that we

1381
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:27,920
are part of

1382
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,839
this change that we want to see and that

1383
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:30,960
we are um

1384
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:34,319
shaping so yes that would be like my uh

1385
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,319
vision of a of an x-rite con and i think

1386
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:37,760
we have started

1387
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:39,520
all of the initiatives that nikki

1388
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,040
mentioned or

1389
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,359
just the demonstration that there is

1390
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:46,000
actually significant and tangible

1391
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
uh initiatives that come out of this

1392
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,760
summit and

1393
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,240
yes but i also know that we are tired we

1394
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,920
don't have the same resources

1395
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:57,680
so definitely definitely a right con

1396
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,440
where we feel you know like

1397
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,720
resourced and um i don't like to use the

1398
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:03,680
word empowered

1399
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:05,520
that often but i think it's really key

1400
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:07,200
in that case

1401
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,839
absolutely inclusion for a reason

1402
00:49:09,839 --> 00:49:10,720
inclusion for

1403
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,920
change okay with that it has been

1404
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,400
our great honor to have you all with us

1405
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:17,359
so

1406
