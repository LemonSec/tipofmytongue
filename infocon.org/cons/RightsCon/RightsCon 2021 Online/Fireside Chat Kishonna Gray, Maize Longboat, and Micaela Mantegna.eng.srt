00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,640
oh my goodness that's the hardest

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,840
question you're going to start with the

70
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
hardest question first

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,160
um so first off thank you for for

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,480
allowing me to share space with you all

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,680
my favorite game

74
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,360
i think i'm a huge fan of the hitman

75
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
series um

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,400
i think that was like one of the games

77
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,680
that i love playing even though it's not

78
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,760
like sandbox or open world i love the

79
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
worlds that you can kind of like roam

80
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,239
and navigate

81
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:02,800
but i also love you know the ai you know

82
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,599
like the the awareness of like the ai

83
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,360
you know so like if you run too fast you

84
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,480
know they're like what are you doing

85
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,599
running like it was i think it was one

86
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,120
of the first games where i saw such

87
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
advanced ai

88
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
um so i would say hitman is probably um

89
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,440
my favorite game but i'm gonna say what

90
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,800
am i playing right now

91
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,959
apex legends is the game that i'm just

92
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,920
uh in terms of my favorite game i think

99
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:36,959
i gotta go with like

100
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
the first game i fell in love with and

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,400
that was pokemon blue

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,040
um i mean i played it as like a very

103
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,799
very young child and i think it was the

104
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,000
first time i kind of

105
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,080
was able to immerse myself and kind of

106
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,599
project my personality

107
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
and my desires onto into a world into a

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,239
virtual world so i'm gonna have to go

109
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,680
with that one and it's also fun to just

110
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:56,400
like

111
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,239
battle pets and grow your team and

112
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
grow your bond through uh through

113
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,920
teamwork

114
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,680
i love that because talking about

115
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
growing bonds and

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,680
that's one of the things i love about

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,599
gaming is that how

118
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,840
they allow us to create bones and to

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
find our communities

120
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,040
uh i i love how kishana presents herself

121
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,238
as a professor

122
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,680
as a gamer person as professor and

123
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,639
that led me to something i wanted to ask

124
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:27,520
to you

125
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,400
how did gaming impact on your research

126
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,040
and work

127
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,919
how that this kind of gaming growing up

128
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,840
this culture of arcade and

129
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:38,639
console gaming led you to your work and

130
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
research

131
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
ah that's a beautiful question um i

132
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
love you know with that bio you know

133
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,120
what what um what

134
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,120
what mckayla's referencing is my twitter

135
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,639
bio where i say of a

136
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,280
gamer posing as a professor um because i

137
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,720
think you know it's one of the biggest

138
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,040
finesses and one of the biggest flexes

139
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,400
that i feel like i've been able to do

140
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,520
like to figure out

141
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,600
how to turn my love and passion of video

142
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,840
games into like a career and a job

143
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,000
you know like i get paid to play video

144
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,320
games and study them and research them

145
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
you know like so i mean i don't know

146
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,360
that's like the biggest flex on earth

147
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,360
and so i'm excited that i get to do that

148
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,639
um but i think

149
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,160
um uh you know i you know i'm a lifelong

150
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,960
gamer right

151
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,120
you know and i think how i didn't

152
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,720
realize that i could do

153
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,039
gaming in this way right you know i

154
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,360
didn't know the different pathways

155
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,280
um i didn't know what the opportunities

156
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,520
were i didn't know what kind of access

157
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
i had to me i didn't know what the

158
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,120
resources were you know so i'm thinking

159
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,639
about you know how i like to like

160
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,639
leverage my privileges and leverage my

161
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,520
resources

162
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,759

communities to let them know like

167
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,720

171
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:56,880
that these are spaces where they they

172
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,880
are valuable they're valued they're

173
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,440
needed

174
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,280
despite what the system or the structure

175
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,440
say i'm like you know games needs

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,919
us right um but i didn't really know how

177
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,759
to like leverage that right and so

178
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,280
i kind of like started you know like

179
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,039
kind of small and incrementally and i

180
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,080
started thinking okay

181
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
well what is it that i could do you know

182
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,600
what's my slice of like the gaming world

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,319
right i'm not

184
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,800
i'm not industry i'm not corporate um

185
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
i've only started recently you know

186
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,160
getting like access to like those kinds

187
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,039
of spaces

188
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,319
but i'm like you know one thing that i

189
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:25,680
could do is just equip folks to

190
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
understand the realities

191
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,039
of what their experiences are gonna be

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:30,479
like if they're streaming

193
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,520
or you know they're trying to become

194
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,520
like a content creator i'm like okay or

195
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,000
you're going

196
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,120
in there this is what the world's going

197
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,160
to be or people who want to be like

198
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,160
designers and developers i'm like okay

199
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,520
well these are like the prior

200
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
experiences you're going to you know

201
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,120
experience probably like a lot of isms

202
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,319
and a lot of you know

203
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,479
a culture and a climate of you know that

204
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:47,919
folks who are like actively probably

205
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,199
trying to push you out

206
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,039
um you know you're going to there's a

207
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,960
lot of precariousness you know i'm

208
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
thinking about like the labor issues and

209
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,400
um you know just how like you know

210
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
workers are not cared for like in the

211
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,080
industry in a lot of like places so

212
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,599
i i feel like you know i've just tried

213
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
to like equip folks with like the

214
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,120
the tools that they need so they can be

215
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,440
aware not necessarily i don't even want

216
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
to use the word like be like successful

217
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,759
right

218
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,280
you know because successful that like

219
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,199
people you know they they measure that

220
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,800
in different ways right you know

221
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,560
so i don't so i want just people just to

222
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,319
be like aware of what it means to be

223
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,720
in a marginalized and minoritized body

224
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,479
in an industry that's dominated by so

225
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,080
many like privileged folks right

226
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
and so i think that's where you know i

227
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,520
wanted to that's why i study

228
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:28,960
what i do i study like online

229
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,319
communities i'm like what's our

230
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
experiences when we're inside those

231
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,520
spaces and that's just been able

232
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,039
i've just expanded that you know in

233
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,960
different kinds of ways so yeah that's

234
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,720
me

235
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
that's amazing uh i was thinking through

236
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,000
your

237
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,240
answer about representation in games

238
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,440
because one of the

239
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,080
persistent myths about gaming culture is

240
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:48,560
that

241
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,199
gay gaming is from for males for

242
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,479
teenagers

243
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,240
and it's something that we have to fight

244
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,560
over all the time i represent

245
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,080
women in games argentina that's a

246
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,080
community that is trying to create a

247
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,080
more diverse space

248
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,520
that includes developers artists

249
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,520
pr people marketing people all the

250
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,039
people working through the

251
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,599
chain value of the of the industry and

252
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,759
one of these persistent myths

253
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,960
is like um that first

254
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,520
games are focused into men and are

255
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,240
marketed

256
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:23,759
to men i have an example like one of my

257
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,759
probably my favorite game in the whole

258
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
universe that is mass effect

259
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,719
it has three editions and only the last

260
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:33,360
one

261
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,000
you can play last last as a male shaper

262
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,760
as a female shepherd but only in the

263
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,559
last

264
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,479
game the marketing materials had

265
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,080
included the

266
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,360
female version of the character that is

267
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,600
also kind of the canonical version

268
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,640
and that's a huge uh

269
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,320
overlook on that um and something that

270
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,240
i want to come to this point about

271
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,160
representation that having female

272
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,080
characters and diverse characters is not

273
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
the same that representation because

274
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:02,399
sometimes

275
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,920
are being included like a filler up and

276
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,440
that that takes me to maze to ask him

277
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,519
about his game that has a very

278
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,640
particular take

279
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,040
about including new narratives and new

280
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:22,720
characters

281
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,279
sorry for that um yeah definitely um i

282
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,720
mean i definitely identify with a lot of

283
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,959
what keyshawn was saying about

284
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
leveraging just being a gamer and

285
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,839
turning it into something more

286
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,000
um because it is part of my identity and

287
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,360
as i said like you know been playing

288
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,080
games

289
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,680
pretty much since as long as i can

290
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,680
remember so i've definitely

291
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:43,920
grown up in this world where games are

292
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,040
just

293
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,600
part of the popular culture and you know

294
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
they just really interested me so

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,040
um yeah i definitely carried that into

296
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,360
my studies first at the university of

297
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,519
british columbia doing my my bachelor's

298
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
in first nations and indigenous studies

299
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
and during that degree like being

300
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,240
introduced to all of the ways in which

301
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,240
indigenous people are using digital

302
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,399
media and games specifically to

303
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,399
share cultural experiences or not you

304
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,519
know just be

305
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,160
indigenous creators in this space and

306
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,000
that was really inspirational for me

307
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,839
specifically looking at games and saying

308
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,839
wow like there are people like me who

309
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,120
look like me who come from

310
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,560
um communities like me and my family

311
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
um you know telling presenting their

312
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,880
their full selves and their full stories

313
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,680
um so that was super inspiring and it it

314
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:32,000
really

315
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,120
made me want to pursue this as an

316
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:36,320
academic pursuit

317
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,560
and understand what it means to make

318
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,240
games from an indigenous perspective and

319
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,839
so that led me to

320
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:45,519
montreal where i am currently residing

321
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,720
and do my masters in

322
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,800
media studies but with a research

323
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,839
creation focus

324
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,519
so through that pathway i created this

325
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:56,320
game

326
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,079
as part of my research project called

327
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
terra nova

328
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,839
and it it it explores as michaela

329
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,279
um mentioned in the intro what first

330
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,640
contact would look like

331
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,399
between indigenous and settler peoples

332
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,000
if it was thousands and thousands of

333
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,959
years

334
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,480
into the future um and some really

335
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,360
interesting

336
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,720
things kind of emerge for me through

337
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:20,480
that process because once i kind of

338
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
finished it i realized that like it's

339
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,519
almost like a representation of me as a

340
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,480
person

341
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,200
my dad's mohawk and i have family from

342
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,959
six nations who reside in six nations of

343
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,640
the grand river in southwestern ontario

344
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:31,920
here in canada

345
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,640
and then also um you know my mom was

346
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,160
born in montreal and

347
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,200
her father's uh family is finnish and

348
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,160
her mother's family is french canadian

349
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:42,480
so

350
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,720
it's very like i come from a very mixed

351
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,800
mixed background and i have these

352
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:47,839
i kind of carry both of these

353
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,279
perspectives with me wherever i go and

354
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,120
with whatever i do

355
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
and so i saw that kind of totally

356
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,639
reflected in the narrative of terra nova

357
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,240
you know it's a two-player cooperative

358
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,760
game

359
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,160
one player plays as tara this indigenous

360
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,120
coded character

361
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,800
who lives on a future earth and then

362
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,560
nova this kind of

363
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,880
subtler alien coded character who lives

364
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,560
in the spaceship and is traveling

365
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,200
through space

366
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,920
um with his community to try and like

367
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,720
find a new home

368
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,360
so um that's kind of how

369
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,880
i was brought into this conversation you

370
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,560
know as the developer of this game

371
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,440
and uh yeah hopefully that answers the

372
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,959
question i kind of lost along the way

373
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,839
but

374
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,320
no no no it's okay and also sparked me

375
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,440
another thing that

376
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
uh while playing terra nova one of the

377
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,480
things i noticed

378
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,800
is that the relationship created between

379
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,639
these two characters that are the

380
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,279
settler

381
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,880
and and the colonizer are cooperation

382
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,760
relationships

383
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,120
and that's very different because always

384
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,120
these kind of narratives are framed in a

385
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,560
confrontational way

386
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,639
so one of the things that called to my

387
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:52,240
attention of the game is like

388
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,880
you are trying to create a new narrative

389
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:55,519
about

390
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,560
how the complexities of how colloidal

391
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,519
processes work

392
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,040
it's not just black and white it's just

393
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
not something that is very

394
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
confrontational it's just layers and

395
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:08,000
layers of of meaning about that

396
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,720
yeah absolutely i intentionally made

397
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,839
terra nova's

398
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:14,720
narrative to be super complicated like i

399
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,440
think

400
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:17,839
in a lot of colonial nations lore we

401
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,200
have these moments

402
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,519
where you know the colonial society

403
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,279
emerges just out of this

404
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:24,880
moment of first contact like chris

405
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,480
columbus lands in

406
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,920
you know the caribbean and he meets the

407
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,200
people there and he's like all right

408
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,560
like this is america now

409
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,839
and then we know what comes after that

410
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
and it's not necessarily

411
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,959
super um good for indigenous people

412
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,279
um but it's really complex like some but

413
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,880
then you have

414
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,639
moments where maybe it is good and it's

415
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,560
it's again it's just complicated and

416
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,079
it's not black and white

417
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
but then we look into our media too and

418
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,279
even sci-fi

419
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:52,160
and we see this very much you know alien

420
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
versus human

421
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,880
locked in combat it's always you know

422
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
either humans going out and colonizing

423
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,680
another world

424
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,639
um and interacting with alien species or

425
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,079
you know aliens coming here

426
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:05,920
and wore the world style trying to take

427
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,000
us over so terra nova wanted to speak

428
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,959
out against that

429
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:10,720
he wanted to show the moment instead of

430
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,480
what came after

431
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:16,480
and really asked players to reflect on

432
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
what are the all the different possible

433
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,120
scenarios that could come out of this

434
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,600
moment does it have to be

435
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,519
colonialism as we understand it and you

436
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,199
know subtler domination

437
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,360
and indigenous people is kind of like

438
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,120
falling by the wayside

439
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,959
um i mean yes that is kind of like our

440
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,519
history

441
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,440
but also no because there are

442
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,360
you know i believe at least as we move

443
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,480
to the future we have these

444
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,000
types of critical conversations about

445
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,079
what it means to be

446
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,360
you know indigenous and what it means to

447
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,440
be settler that we can come up with

448
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:48,800
you know new speculative future

449
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,199
scenarios and build something more

450
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,720
positive and equitable for everybody i

451
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:57,600
can think that we are amongst nerds here

452
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,360
so i'm going to quote something for star

453
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,160
trek

454
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
uh i don't know if you are into star

455
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,440
trek and

456
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,000
but one of the things on deep space nine

457
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
is like that is like showing the

458
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,880
complexities that

459
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,279
you have like this tension between hate

460
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,880
and love and

461
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
all kind of relationships that you

462
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,880
establish with your colonizers

463
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,160
and speaking about dominance that is a

464
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
predominant theme because we have like

465
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,079
in video games is like this heroic

466
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,360
culture and this

467
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,399
hipper hyper masculinity culture

468
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,160
and this is a question for both of you

469
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,199
how do you find yourself represented in

470
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:37,360
games when is the first time that you

471
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,199
find yourself in a game and

472
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,360
did something click on you or like

473
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,240
saying

474
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,639
this is me this is my community what

475
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,040
about yuki shana

476
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
um there's there's so much happening

477
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,480
there's so much that i even wanted to

478
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,040
like say

479
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
like you know respond to like with with

480
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,279
maize um is it possible for me to do

481
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,639
that like i don't want i'm gonna answer

482
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,600
that question

483
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,480
but yeah no no it's okay okay go go

484
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,680
whatever you want

485
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,600
maze i often get like the question that

486
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
people uh people say that like

487
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,240
gaming will catch up related to like

488
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,000
diversity equity and inclusion and

489
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,759
representations like we just have to

490
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,480
we have to give them time right and i

491
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,440
often um

492
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,519
so so for instance like i feel like that

493
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,480
if you

494
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,560
hadn't come along with your powerful

495
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
narrative and your powerful game

496
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,759
the gaming industry would never have

497
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:27,279
done that you know they they tend to

498
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,240
think you know

499
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,560
that that they um they they just have to

500
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:31,759
you know equip themselves

501
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,040
like the knowledge and then they'll

502
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
eventually like reach that point and to

503
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,600
me that sounds

504
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,480
aspirational um but it also sounds like

505
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,000
it sounds foolhardy it sounds like you

506
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,560
know

507
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:41,839
does it make sense what i'm saying like

508
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,839
so if we don't push them do you think

509
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
the industry will eventually reach the

510
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,639
point where they're creating

511
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,560
these beautiful complex like narratives

512
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,880
like you like you did like in terra nova

513
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,000
what do you think about that

514
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,040
well that's those very nice words um i

515
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,240
think

516
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
that it's a really tough question um

517
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,279
and definitely one that we're talking

518
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,480
about a lot these days within the

519
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,000
industry but also in academic circles

520
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,240
and within just like public discourse on

521
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:10,200
twitter and social media and all this um

522
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,280
[Music]

523
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,599
but i truly believe that like you know

524
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:15,039
these issues of representation

525
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:18,240
in popular media need to be dealt with

526
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
by the people that are

527
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,880
and the communities that are being

528
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
represented and that means

529
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,959
and at every level like not just from

530
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,839
you know the consultancy on a project

531
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,679
um you know that has indigenous themes

532
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,600
or or afro themes

533
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
or you know latinx themes but

534
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,559
all the way up through you know from

535
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,559
that consultancy side to the developer

536
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,360
side

537
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,679
um producer production and also like

538
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
executive level like

539
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,200
people in tech the tech community in the

540
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,840
gaming

541
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,640
community are still from that like

542
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,919
leadership

543
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,120
like rung of decision making it's still

544
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,799
pretty overwhelmingly overwhelmingly

545
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:58,240
white and overwhelmingly male

546
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,520
and that's just the fact so i think only

547
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:02,000
through

548
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,919
you know diversifying those spaces

549
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,360
intentionally because we have the

550
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
capacity

551
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,320
to be there um then

552
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,919
that's when the change is going to come

553
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,000
and i don't i mean i think

554
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,360
i was just doing my thing when i was

555
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,039
creating terra nova i wasn't i was i was

556
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,400
thinking critically about what i was

557
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
doing but i wasn't necessarily

558
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:21,760
like wanting to put this in the hands of

559
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,679
studios and saying like do this

560
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,400
do better but it was more you know that

561
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:26,960
personal

562
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,360
journey of reflection and growth um but

563
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,799
i'm really glad it's being interpreted

564
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:32,960
by people like yourselves like

565
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,559
that it could mean something more and be

566
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,400
indicative of something more and

567
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,120
i mean it is it wasn't really motivated

568
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,320
by money and i think that's

569
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,360
that's something that needs to be called

570
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,679
out too like games are like any other

571
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:44,880
form of media

572
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
a lot of the decision making is

573
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,799
motivated by profit

574
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
um and i think that's really restrictive

575
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,160
in our

576
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:55,520
capitalist world unfortunately

577
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:57,120
absolutely i appreciate you taking time

578
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,720
with that i'm sorry now michaela oh did

579
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,919
you have a follow but i'm going to

580
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,600
answer your question now i have an

581
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
answer for that

582
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,120
um i'm thinking about the first time

583
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,160
that i

584
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,200
you know saw myself as a black woman

585
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,400
like reflected in in a video game i

586
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,840
really don't think that that really

587
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,640
happened until 2011.

588
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,240
like that was just like what 10 years

589
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,919
ago right and when you think about how

590
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,960
like how

591
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,960
old the gaming industry is and how old

592
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,000
games is

593
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,760
so um dead island uh zombie game

594
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,320
perna jackson i believe she was the

595
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,200
first time that i was able to play

596
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,200
as a black woman in the game now i think

597
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,400
around that same time

598
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,039
you know resident evil had released um

599
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,720
y'all remember when they went to africa

600
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,720
and had the african zombies and shiva

601
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
was just like

602
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,520
yeah yeah i don't think we could play as

603
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,240
her though

604
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
if i can recall like i don't i'm not i'm

605
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,000
not a fan of the resident evil like

606
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,080
series you know i never really played it

607
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,440
um but i don't think you

608
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,679
can you play her michaela interestingly

609
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,360
you can play it if you play the game in

610
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,080
co-op

611
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,919
so if you have like the player two you

612
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,679
can play as a woman that says

613
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:06,400
says a lot about that that if you wanted

614
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,280
to play

615
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,640
yeah very interesting okay well um

616
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,400
well even it was so many problems with

617
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,919
that i just refused to play that one

618
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,600
because it was just so problematic but i

619
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,600
feel like um perna jackson dead island

620
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,039
was the first time i was able to play as

621
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:21,280
a black woman but they did the colorism

622
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:21,679
thing

623
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,080
in that game right so i remember like in

624
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
the game play

625
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,600
um perna jackson's a dark-skinned black

626
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,720
woman but

627
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,960
in some of like the um the marketing and

628
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,400
advertising materials like they

629
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,440
lightened her skin

630
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,600
you know and so you know so it's like

631
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,120
it's like a win and then a miss you know

632
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,320
it's like you know they they're i guess

633
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,120
they we can't

634
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,039
we can't expect them to do everything

635
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,039
perfect um but you know they were just

636
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,720
like reinforcing you know

637
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,880
uh you know european standards of beauty

638
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
you know reinforcing especially like you

639
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,440
know the problematic

640
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,200
narrative of like colorism especially in

641
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,480
you know black and brown communities

642
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:52,799
which

643
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,799
you know we we we experienced like a

644
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,840
whole lot so

645
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,440
um i think that was the first time and i

646
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,120
had i had fun i think that's what got me

647
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:00,480
into like the zombie genre because i was

648
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,240
never really into like zombies but

649
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,320
dead island got me into it so yeah i

650
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:07,360
answered your question finally i'm sorry

651
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,919
that's perfect uh and what about you

652
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,280
mates

653
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,159
yeah for me um it's a little bit weirder

654
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,559
but

655
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
um when i first stepped into world of

656
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,600
warcraft

657
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,960
and i was able to be a tauren which is

658
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,400
this race of like

659
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:25,919
cow human people um and they

660
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,320
their society the art direction of that

661
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,240
you know playable race in this

662
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,679
and this uh ip from blizzard has them

663
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
like wearing buckskin and feathers and

664
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,880
living teepees and stuff and it's very

665
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:39,280
like

666
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,919
you know plains native american

667
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,720
aesthetic from like westerns and stuff

668
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,760
which is super problematic you know um

669
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,880
it was never okay it isn't okay

670
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,280
uh but there was something weird within

671
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,720
me as like a young

672
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,000
11 12 year old gamer saying like wow

673
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,360
like i feel like i can make a choice

674
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,720
and i can make a choice to be an

675
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,159
indigenous character and that felt

676
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:05,280
really good

677
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,640
um but yeah it's not okay

678
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,320
it wasn't okay then it's not okay now it

679
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,000
won't be okay moving forward

680
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,520
um i really wish they would do something

681
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,840
with that because it's such a big ip

682
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,240
i still play wow to this day it's kind

683
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,600
of like what i'm really enjoying right

684
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:20,320
now

685
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,679
um but you know it's not great

686
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:27,120
so actually on a more positive note

687
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,200
um the first time that i played a game

688
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,240
where i felt like

689
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,640
i played as an indigenous character in a

690
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:33,360
way that was

691
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,760
um you know as the developer was treated

692
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,080
with a lot of care was never alone

693
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,159
kasima ingenchuna which is this

694
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,120
platformer

695
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,200
cooperative you know i feel like i've

696
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,960
referenced it in terra nova a little bit

697
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,000
but um you play as nuna who's this

698
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:48,640
anupiya

699
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,919
girl um from alaska and

700
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,039
you know you're moving through this

701
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,960
world um that's like really really

702
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,799
beautiful in the arctic

703
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
and you're trying to like save your

704
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,240
community from this never-ending

705
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,360
blizzard that you don't know

706
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,400
why it's there but it's there and um

707
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
you're doing so alongside your your best

708
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,000
friend who's a an arctic

709
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,360
fox and it's just a really cute game but

710
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,520
it's also really culturally significant

711
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,640
because it was done

712
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,919
in consultation with the community um

713
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:17,760
so i would i recommend people go play

714
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,000
that as like it so much writing and

715
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,159
media and commentary has been done on

716
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,760
that game but yeah that was one that i

717
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
was really really excited about and kind

718
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:27,679
of

719
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,520
you know inspired me springboarded me

720
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,039
into doing the work that i was doing

721
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:33,520
um you know for the past several years

722
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,480
and

723
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,799
on that note i would love michaela like

724
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:38,720
what what about you you know you're

725
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
you're kind of on the same you know

726
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:42,480
playing field as us in terms of your

727
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,080
relationship with games and

728
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,360
and oh yeah critical theory so the first

729
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,000
time i

730
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,880
i really love the gears of war series

731
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:51,840
and

732
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,000
i love when i get to play with anya

733
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,400
because i wanted to play as a cool

734
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,039
warrior

735
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,679
as a cool woman but for me was

736
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,039
problematic because it was

737
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,200
as you were saying the representation of

738
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:06,720
a blonde girl that

739
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:09,039
doesn't really have to do anything with

740
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:09,919
me

741
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,400
so the the last installation of the game

742
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,320
that when you have like another kind of

743
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:16,320
character with a mixed heritage

744
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,720
kind of represent me more but coming

745
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,720
back is mass effect is one of

746
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,320
as i was saying one of my favorite games

747
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,840
and had this kind of

748
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,720
very cool ability to that you can shape

749
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,520
your character

750
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,640
in any way you want it so i could

751
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:32,640
create a character that was not only

752
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,159
physically related to myself

753
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,640
but also with my values and my emotions

754
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,600
that is something

755
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,919
very interesting because games are for

756
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:40,960
me are ways

757
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,440
and gateways for creating narratives of

758
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,240
empathy

759
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,240
that you can try different skins and you

760
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,279
can

761
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
feel things that maybe an experiment

762
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,320
with things that

763
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,279
maybe uh you don't do in your life or

764
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:54,240
you are not

765
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,360
aware that you are in your real life and

766
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:58,400
so i value

767
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,799
a lot this kind of rehearsal spaces that

768
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:01,600
they allow us

769
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,559
to to try new things and to dream about

770
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:05,200
to become

771
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,240
things i always say that i becoming

772
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,400
interested in do research about the

773
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,480
ethics of artificial intelligence

774
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,679
white thinking about these alien races

775
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,039
and these robot races

776
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,279
and their struggles because they were

777
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
machines but they also were sentient and

778
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,400
they were treated as

779
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,520
treated as slaves so for me games are a

780
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
very powerful way to create these

781
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,240
narratives and

782
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:31,279
transmit a message and this this

783
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:33,600
comes to something that i i want to ask

784
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,559
you if you have shared

785
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,400
in your experiences and your research is

786
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,080
that games has been

787
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,159
overlooked as something that is minor

788
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:42,000
that is something not worthy of

789
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,200
study and research and nowadays we have

790
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,960
this kind of explosion of gaming

791
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,880
that everyone in lockdown is playing

792
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
games everyone is connecting through

793
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,760
games

794
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:55,760
and even the the warhead organization

795
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,000
has

796
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,640
to change its view about addiction

797
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:59,200
because

798
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,520
we have like this several layers on

799
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,120
gaming that we can talk about

800
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
because we have like this individual

801
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
level on how games affect us

802
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,279
how to create community through games

803
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:11,200
also the the good and the bad

804
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,840
about games like the toxicity that they

805
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,799
create

806
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,799
we can create communities for good and

807
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,279
we can found our peers through gaming

808
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,640
but also games enable a lot of uh

809
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,360
toxicity and violence against women and

810
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,000
also

811
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,400
i wish we could have celia to to talk

812
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,200
about this

813
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,679
the dark patterns of addiction that are

814
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,200
trying to be embedded into

815
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:36,559
into games and what is your experience

816
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:37,600
to kind of these

817
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,000
layers of individual collective and also

818
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,559
good and bad

819
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,240
that's uh it's a lot a lot in one

820
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,760
question right so i want to break down

821
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:48,960
you know i want to make sure that i

822
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,240
think i understand like what you're

823
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,080
asking so i heard things about addiction

824
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,440
i heard things about you know gaming

825
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,960
being like ignored but now all of a

826
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,039
sudden everybody's like a gamer right

827
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,720
um i think that that's really like

828
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,720
interesting you know the the pandemic

829
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
and coveted like being in quarantine

830
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,799
i think it really highlighted you know

831
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,559
um of course reframed like a lot of our

832
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:07,679
thinking around

833
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:09,520
you know our consumption like our our

834
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,279
entertainment consumption right

835
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,039
um what we consider like leisure and

836
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,159
what we consider like you know

837
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:15,279
recreation

838
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,600
um but i i feel like it also i'm glad

839
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
like it dismantled like a lot of that

840
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,279
stigma you know associated with like

841
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:22,799
gaming right you know because there's so

842
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:23,840
much like even

843
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:26,080
as academics you know you all know like

844
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,440
you know we've got our colleagues

845
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,240
asking us like oh you play video games

846
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,600
oh that's child's play you know they

847
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,200
have no idea

848
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,600
about you know the anatomy of gaming and

849
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,600
the architecture of like the spaces i'm

850
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,720
like you know it's more

851
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:41,120
complex than that right um and i think

852
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,559
that that's why there's so little

853
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,480
research because it's not enough of us

854
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,039
like who

855
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,120
actually play like doing like a lot of

856
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,720
this work so i love like you know that

857
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,440
we are

858
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,399
um i i love that moment i love corn cove

859
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,399
probably only because of that because

860
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,840
it really told the world that anybody

861
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,520
can be a gamer and you should be gaming

862
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,799
right now because you have nothing else

863
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,720
to do like i love that narrative right

864
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,480
but i also want to make sure that you

865
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:03,919
know i saw of course like the other

866
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,200
problematic narratives that were

867
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,799
associated with that right

868
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,399
of course we saw a lot of that moral

869
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,159
panicky like language of course the

870
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,679
addiction conversations were happening

871
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,039
and of course conversations around like

872
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,000
screen time

873
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,440
and you know parents are like well we're

874
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,799
cooped up all day well what's all the

875
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:18,240
screen time going to do to my child

876
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,440
what's all this doing and

877
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,200
and you know luckily you know we've got

878
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,720
like decades of research that

879
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,320
you know can dismantle like to spend all

880
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,760
that but i don't know if that

881
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,039
information was getting to the people

882
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,399
who really needed it i think that's one

883
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:29,279
of the

884
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:30,880
the concerns that that i had you know

885
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,320
when i saw like some of the popular

886
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:33,840
articles like coming out you know from

887
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
like the washington post or whatever or

888
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,360
you know like new york times like

889
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,120
you know i don't i don't know that i

890
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,559
don't know that we're in control of our

891
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,240
narratives enough like within the gaming

892
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,200
world right

893
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,480
you know i don't know like you know what

894
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,840
i'm gonna say like you know games

895
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,360
journalism you know they spend a lot of

896
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,200
time like inward focusing and like

897
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,559
internally looking

898
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,159
and not really realizing that there's

899
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:54,320
like this outward external conversation

900
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,840
that we need to be in charge of and like

901
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,520
we need to be controlling as well

902
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,799
you know because right now it's still

903
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,320
like you know the folks who are you know

904
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:00,799
of the

905
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,960
moral panic variety who are really like

906
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
controlling like a lot of the narratives

907
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,520
right now and i think that's kind of

908
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,880
like what you were getting at like with

909
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,640
like the addiction kind of conversation

910
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,279
right

911
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,440
um but i think that you know um whenever

912
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,640
i had my gaming lab

913
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,559
you know i spent a lot of time like um

914
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:16,000
with um you know uh

915
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,320
guardians and uh parents and elders you

916
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,760
know of of children

917
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
to help them like understand okay this

918
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,240
is what your child is doing in this game

919
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,520
you know this is what they're doing when

920
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,120
they're spending all of this amount of

921
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:27,919
time there

922
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,840
and getting them to like reframe that

923
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:31,760
and to see you know i also hate to like

924
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,440
reduce what we're doing like in games

925
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,679
like skills based conversations i'm like

926
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,320
but they're

927
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:37,840
developing this skill they're learning

928
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,919
how to do that they can possibly

929
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:41,679
translate this into maybe

930
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,520
something like a career or you know

931
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,120
translate it into like you know a skill

932
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:45,919
that they could

933
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:47,840
take into like a computer science major

934
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,039
or something you know but but

935
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,039
we have to like finesse it like in those

936
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,240
ways so people can

937
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,000
understand and not not just think that

938
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,760
their their kids are like wasting their

939
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,240
time

940
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,000
when they're on roblox all day you know

941
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
and so i guess i wish we had like a lot

942
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,360
more of that you know the people who are

943
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,039
like the advocates and cheerleaders

944
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,880
like games that are having these public

945
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,799
conversations you know because i hate

946
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,240
that you know it's like the you know i

947
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,039
don't i don't want to

948
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,799
you know publicly like shame like people

949
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,159
but you know if we think about

950
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,399
you know like like high-profile people

951
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,240
like like ninja that like dominate like

952
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
the conversation

953
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,279
and then people get like a negative view

954
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:21,120
and like it's like skewed negatively

955
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,720
you know like well why would i want my

956
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,080
girls in a space where you know people

957
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:24,960
don't want to play with them because

958
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,919
they're girls or

959
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:27,120
why would they be in there because all

960
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
these tux because all this toxic spaces

961
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,440
and

962
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,039
i can't send you know let my kids watch

963
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:32,640
youtube because of all the the top the

964
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,159
toxic algorithm that's going to feed

965
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:35,440
them all this awful stuff you know i'm

966
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,080
like

967
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,200
i'm like yes i get all that but you know

968
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,600
there's

969
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,600
other things like happening and i feel

970
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,600
like that we spend so much of our time

971
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,600
combating those kinds of narratives

972
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,200
that i don't want to say it stops our

973
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,039
building and it stops our growth

974
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,360
but i'm sitting here thinking about when

975
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,039
i'm asked to give a talk and how much i

976
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:54,159
have to like talk about

977
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,559
racism and sexism i'm like okay but

978
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,519
there's so much

979
00:30:57,519 --> 00:30:59,440
more here than just that but you know i

980
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,960
know a lot of people are still just like

981
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,399
at that conversation

982
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:04,240
and i get it but i guess i guess i i

983
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,480
just wish we were further along

984
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
you know when you think about like

985
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,840
imagining like the future i guess i just

986
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:10,799
wish that we were

987
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,880
having different kinds of conversations

988
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,159
um but we're still kind of having like

989
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,360
the same conversations

990
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,480
yeah absolutely every time i gave a

991
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,000
lecture or a talk

992
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,000
one of the things i start to dismantle

993
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,360
this prejudice is like

994
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,159
showing the other side of gaming because

995
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,159
i don't know your views on on this but

996
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:30,640
for me it's like people tend to see

997
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,440
video games

998
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:34,080
as thinking like movies is all marvel

999
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,840
studios and superhero movies

1000
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:37,919
so they don't know that like this kind

1001
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:39,120
of independence

1002
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,120
side of gaming and all these beautiful

1003
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,880
narratives and beautiful games

1004
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:45,200
so my first take on this is like showing

1005
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,960
two three four games like

1006
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:50,559
my name is sun uh um like this war of

1007
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:51,039
mine

1008
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:54,240
like games about being a migrant i

1009
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:54,799
showed

1010
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:56,960
uh parents about this game that dragon

1011
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
cancer the whole people

1012
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,799
have translated their suffering

1013
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:02,720
experience into a game because another

1014
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,799
pressure is against gaming is like games

1015
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:06,480
are created for fun

1016
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:08,880
and one of the things that for me that

1017
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,600
we

1018
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,000
should kind of talk about is that games

1019
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,480
are ways to tell stories and the story

1020
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,240
that you're going to tell

1021
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,200
is up to you so a game can contain a sad

1022
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:19,919
story

1023
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,399
a beautiful narrative something talking

1024
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,080
about the war from the perspective of

1025
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:25,360
survivor or talking

1026
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,519
about the war from the perspective of

1027
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:28,640
someone that is

1028
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,320
losing a loved one to the war but

1029
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,399
i think that one of the the things that

1030
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:35,760
we have to

1031
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,399
aspire for as people working in the

1032
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:39,519
space of video games

1033
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,159
is that to deconstruct this narrative of

1034
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:43,440
games are for teenagers

1035
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,720
just for fun and just about uh

1036
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
menial things that are irrelevant and

1037
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:49,760
not

1038
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,279
it won't be useful and that you're

1039
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:54,840
wasting your time while you're playing

1040
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,720
games

1041
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,120
yeah i could just chime in here too um

1042
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,320
you know i just want to thank you both

1043
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,600
for like all the work that you're doing

1044
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,679
with your communities and beyond like

1045
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:06,000
sharing that word i have definitely come

1046
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,120
like bumped up against that

1047
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,279
in my experience as well um if i could

1048
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,799
just digress a little bit

1049
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:12,559
and talk about like what happened when i

1050
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,399
was wrapping up development on terra

1051
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,960
nova and i was like doing play testing

1052
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,480
um i i was at my my mom's house

1053
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,240
and i was like hey like like we're gonna

1054
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,080
do a presentation like with your

1055
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:25,440
students um because she's a

1056
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:28,399
elementary school teacher um you know

1057
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:29,440
we're going to do a presentation on this

1058
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,440
game with your students tomorrow like

1059
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,679
don't you want to test out the game and

1060
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,279
see how it is and at this point like she

1061
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,559
knew i was working on a game but she

1062
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,200
didn't really know

1063
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:40,480
much about it and she's never really

1064
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
engaged with video games at all other

1065
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,000
than through me and you know

1066
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,600
forming her thoughts and opinions about

1067
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,440
how i've interacted with them

1068
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,880
you know from her perspective as a

1069
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,480
mother and then also

1070
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,880
you know hearing as you guys said like

1071
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,799
through the

1072
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:56,640
you know just external commentary

1073
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,720
through you know other sorts of

1074
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,240
sources of media that aren't necessarily

1075
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,240
like part of the gaming industry

1076
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,080
and you know we played this the game

1077
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,440
together you know we played this

1078
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,200
cooperative experience together and she

1079
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
she said like wow like thank you for

1080
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,599
sharing this i didn't know that games

1081
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:12,399
could be

1082
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,359
about anything other than killing other

1083
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:16,320
people with guns

1084
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,280
and i was like yeah like this is i

1085
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,000
didn't i had

1086
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:23,599
no interest in creating a game where

1087
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:25,440
you know we were violent toward one

1088
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,040
another or

1089
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,480
you know we saw blood and gore just for

1090
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,800
just for entertainment purposes like

1091
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,480
this is a game about

1092
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,399
a story that i wanted to tell and a

1093
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:37,839
story that i wanted to share with others

1094
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,040
because it's a story that i've been

1095
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,879
thinking about for a long time

1096
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,239
um and i think it has something to

1097
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,560
contribute so

1098
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:46,399
i mean maybe it's a little bit my fault

1099
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:47,760
playing games like call of duty when i

1100
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:48,639
was growing up and

1101
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:51,440
and showing this stuff to her and

1102
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,159
introducing

1103
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:54,159
this stuff to her back then but i really

1104
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,199
love how our

1105
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,599
you know our relationship kind of grew

1106
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:58,880
and our understanding of one another

1107
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,240
grew a little bit more through having

1108
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,680
that experience with this game that i

1109
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:02,240
was just

1110
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,520
creating because i was interested in

1111
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,160
creating it

1112
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,119
and for me also games as you were saying

1113
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,040
that it enabled this conversation with

1114
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,000
your mom

1115
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,839
i'm seeing a lot of parents that are

1116
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:16,079
starting to starting to play games

1117
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,880
with their teenagers and they find in

1118
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:19,920
this kind of

1119
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,160
not looking into the eyes of the one

1120
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,520
another but playing by

1121
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,079
by side by side like this space where

1122
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,920
they can have like very difficult

1123
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,280
conversations

1124
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,920
and in this kind of relaxed game so i i

1125
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,520
also value this kind of games

1126
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,560
because sometimes people take value from

1127
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,520
fortnite of

1128
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,400
another these kind of social games uh

1129
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:40,800
just

1130
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,880
thinking that uh i i'm a day by day

1131
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,720
daylight player and i play

1132
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
almost weekly with my friends and that's

1133
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:47,920
my space

1134
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:51,119
to talk about our week to unwind but

1135
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,400
also to construct

1136
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:56,000
our our relationship and i think that

1137
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
this is something that sometimes gets

1138
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,839
lost in the narratives of video games

1139
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:00,320
that

1140
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,800
people get isolated in games that people

1141
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,880
play alone and the reality is that we

1142
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,680
play together

1143
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,920
and that we construct things together

1144
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:08,720
and that

1145
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,200
we can extract conversations from those

1146
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,839
games

1147
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,680
i think that's a beautiful point

1148
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,000
michaela and i think that that's where

1149
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,440
a lot of folks don't even realize you

1150
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,440
know the possibilities and potentials

1151
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,520
of what gaming can offer right you know

1152
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,119
just that community building

1153
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,640
and it's so interesting you know i'm

1154
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,880
just thinking about how equipped

1155
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,400
gamers were for quarantine right

1156
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,400
like they were already ready to go i'm

1157
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,599
like hey i got i'm

1158
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,599
like and even think about i remember um

1159
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,359
you know hearing some of my um

1160
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:42,880
um like some of the parents that are

1161
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,480
part of like you know like school groups

1162
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,359
um

1163
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:48,560
and just hearing them uh talk about that

1164
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,240
their kids were missing out on so much

1165
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,000
social um

1166
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,359
and i i i couldn't contribute to that

1167
00:36:55,359 --> 00:36:56,960
conversation was like my children are

1168
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
not missing out on social

1169
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,720
because they have a social life like

1170
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:02,560
through games and i think that was like

1171
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,599
you know it was like one of those

1172
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:04,960
communities of like you know parents who

1173
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:06,160
are really restrictive global like

1174
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:08,160
screen time you know of course devaluing

1175
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,040
and diminishing

1176
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,119
like games and you know i was sitting in

1177
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:12,480
an ipad and stuff

1178
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:14,960
and they were not prepared for

1179
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:15,920
quarantine

1180
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,280
you know they were not prepared and

1181
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,640
their their kids weren't equipped you

1182
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,359
know to have

1183
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:20,960
you know to continue with like social

1184
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,119
relationships and and with community

1185
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:24,400
you know because they didn't allow their

1186
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,160
kids to like play games and like be in

1187
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,560
there

1188
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:28,320
and so i'm just thinking about how much

1189
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,320
like you know gamers um

1190
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,040
uh didn't like didn't struggle i mean

1191
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
there were other struggles like i'm not

1192
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,280
you know trying to

1193
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,200
diminish it like in that way but i think

1194
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,800
that that's like a great point that that

1195
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,079
you made there um

1196
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,079
michaela um but i think that's there's

1197
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,079
so much that folks can learn

1198
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:45,920
from the gaming space as well and take

1199
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,599
forward like i'm even thinking about

1200
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:50,720
how much like the gamers like um

1201
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,040
helped um like our gaming students help

1202
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,400
like the professors with like online

1203
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,760
classes of like hey

1204
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,520
you don't have to just use zoom and you

1205
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,960
don't have to just use this you know

1206
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,480
you can use twitch you know i'm just

1207
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,000
thinking about you know i remember doing

1208
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,440
like a workshop like to help like you

1209
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:04,880
know a lot of my colleagues think about

1210
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:06,400
like different modalities and different

1211
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:07,599
ways to like deliver

1212
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:08,960
information i'm like you don't have to

1213
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,800
just be stuck in blackboard you know

1214
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,240
there are like some cool things i'm just

1215
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,359
thinking about just how

1216
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,280
gamers were ready for quarantine we were

1217
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,040
really primed you know for that moment

1218
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,160
and you know we shined

1219
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:21,279
we shined a whole lot too

1220
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,920
totally i i totally agree with that

1221
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,760
because we were we had the lights we had

1222
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,440
the streaming capabilities

1223
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:30,400
and also it it's amazing yeah that's

1224
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,119
right

1225
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,000
i remember a few years ago uh that i

1226
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:35,599
couldn't travel to a conference and i

1227
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:36,800
proposed to them like

1228
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,119
i do regular streamings i i teach on

1229
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,640
twitch uh how to play magic the

1230
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,320
gathering that is another game that i'm

1231
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,599
passionate about

1232
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,960
and i propose to them like hey we can do

1233
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,960
this i can travel but we can do this

1234
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,560
over twitch and we can do this over

1235
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:51,200
youtube

1236
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:53,440
and that was a gaming conference and

1237
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,640
that was kind of

1238
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,240
we can do this uh so for me it's like

1239
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,119
super interesting to see how and this

1240
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:01,839
kind of

1241
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:03,760
takes me to another area of research

1242
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,359
that are streamers because

1243
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:09,040
now gamers were kind of consuming

1244
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,520
entertainment products but now they have

1245
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:12,880
integrating themselves

1246
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,160
into the this kind of creation uh

1247
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:16,720
process

1248
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,480
and now they have become creators

1249
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,480
themselves and they are taking games and

1250
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,680
transforming games

1251
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,000
which for me as a digital and cultural

1252
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,520
artifact is amazing

1253
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,599
because i did a lot my background is in

1254
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,359
intellectual property law and i did a

1255
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:30,400
lot with these

1256
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,880
kind of restrictions that you have over

1257
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,560
how you do playing games

1258
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:36,800
and one of the amazing things about

1259
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,160
streaming is like

1260
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,000
if you want to stream a movie you are

1261
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,839
going to get um

1262
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,280
that movie is going to get down that

1263
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,880
stream is going to take uh

1264
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,680
down immediately but it didn't happen

1265
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,720
with games

1266
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,000
and this kind of symbiosis between the

1267
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,400
publishers and the developers and the

1268
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,280
gamers

1269
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,720
that enabled this space to create over

1270
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,000
this kind of

1271
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,400
their intellectual property without

1272
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,960
asking gamers to pay a license

1273
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:08,000
and now gamers are like we are entitled

1274
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:08,800
to do this

1275
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,960
with these games and that created this

1276
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,560
kind of beautiful space

1277
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,000
when streamers and people playing sports

1278
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:16,319
for

1279
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:19,200
for money and esports has flourish and

1280
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,280
this is amazing because it separates

1281
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,880
video games from other creative

1282
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:25,839
industries and we have these kind of

1283
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,560
kids that are creating careers and they

1284
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:31,119
are doing kind of these creative outlets

1285
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:32,960
through streaming and for me this is

1286
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,119
something that my generation didn't have

1287
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:35,440
it

1288
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:39,839
and and and for me is amazing

1289
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,920
i wonder i didn't know if maize was

1290
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,440
gonna like respond to that

1291
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,760
but there was something uh are we okay

1292
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,880
for tom because there was something i

1293
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,160
wanted to like revisit

1294
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,760
and like ask maze and ask you all's

1295
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,599
opinion okay okay great

1296
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:57,280
um one of the things that i wonder you

1297
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,880
know amazing as you were talking you

1298
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,680
know about

1299
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,960
you being in that space and like

1300
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,280
creating your game and also like playing

1301
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,000
um

1302
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,240
you know the problematic narratives of

1303
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
you know black indigenous latinx folks

1304
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,680
asian populations you know just how

1305
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,119
problematic those narratives like have

1306
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,319
been in games

1307
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,079
i remember having like a conversation

1308
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:15,040
and thinking about like a different

1309
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:16,160
media you know we were talking about

1310
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,079
like film and and tv

1311
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,760
and there's something that that we call

1312
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,680
like the tyler perry effect

1313
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,680
of how you know there are problematic

1314
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:25,040
narratives that are out there

1315
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,720
but because that's all we have like we

1316
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,160
need to consume it and we have to

1317
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:30,400
consume it to prove to the industry

1318
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,839
that we are uh we have consumption um

1319
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:34,640
power

1320
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,280
um that we will support that and that

1321
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,200
that in turn would lead to

1322
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,760
more diverse narratives i never agreed

1323
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,599
with that because i'm like if we

1324
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:46,160
are if we accept like the stereotypical

1325
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:47,520
kind of like practices then they're

1326
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,200
gonna always give us that

1327
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,880
because that's what's gonna you know

1328
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,319
sell that's what's gonna make money and

1329
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,920
when you go more complex

1330
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,839
the audiences aren't ready to consume

1331
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,200
that does that make sense like what i'm

1332
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,000
saying

1333
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:00,720
um do you all do you all what are your

1334
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,480
thoughts like on that of like okay just

1335
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:04,079
because we have that content that we

1336
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:05,520
have to consume it

1337
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,720
um yes because because we do it i really

1338
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:09,359
thought about

1339
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,960
you know your your your play with you

1340
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,040
know world of warcraft maze made me

1341
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:17,839
think about that

1342
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,280
yeah this is kind of the uh the question

1343
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:24,800
right is like

1344
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:29,040
how do we push the narrative forward

1345
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,000
externally when you know we can also

1346
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,119
push the narrative forward

1347
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:36,400
internally within the spaces too um

1348
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,920
i don't know if i have an answer for it

1349
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,520
so maybe i'll just talk about

1350
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,760
how this has touched me and my research

1351
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,800
um and stuff which is like

1352
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,560
through my research and creating terra

1353
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,839
nova as part of

1354
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:51,359
of my thesis in my master's i also

1355
00:42:51,359 --> 00:42:53,839
you know was looking at indigenous video

1356
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:55,680
game development practices in general

1357
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,640
and kind of like that history and

1358
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,560
what i was finding or what i found in

1359
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,000
like the work of

1360
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,880
um for example elizabeth lafontaine

1361
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,760
who's

1362
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:09,440
a metis anishinaabe an irish

1363
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,359
game developer and scholar and as well

1364
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:13,839
as like the work of

1365
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,480
um aboriginal territories in cyberspace

1366
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,839
which is a research lab of concordia

1367
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:18,960
that i got to work with while i was

1368
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:21,839
doing my masters is like

1369
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:24,839
indigenous communities and indigenous

1370
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:27,680
people will consume

1371
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,319
games and media and you know

1372
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,480
representations of themselves

1373
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:35,610
but it um

1374
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,000
[Music]

1375
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,160
amazing change really happens when the

1376
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:41,119
tools

1377
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:43,040
of production are really placed into the

1378
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,400
hands of those creators and they get to

1379
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:45,359
make

1380
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:47,440
to be in power make decisions about what

1381
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,680
enters into the things that they create

1382
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:51,040
so you know i don't think we're ever

1383
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:53,040
gonna really get to a point where

1384
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:56,800
you know we're we're seeing good

1385
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,160
cultural and diverse representations in

1386
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,319
games and other media until again like

1387
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,000
what i was saying before it was like

1388
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
when we're in the in in the board rooms

1389
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,119
and the writing rooms

1390
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,240
in the developers chairs even coding

1391
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,079
you know creating the game and the

1392
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:14,640
design from the code up

1393
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:18,000
and you know

1394
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:20,079
diverse experiences are even like

1395
00:44:20,079 --> 00:44:22,319
factored into those decisions too

1396
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:24,640
and again like power is such a big part

1397
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,040
of that

1398
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,599
for me also i agree that diversity is

1399
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:30,720
key to have

1400
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,880
each and every one of us representing

1401
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,400
all along the process of creation of

1402
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,760
video games

1403
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,520
and if i can chime in with something

1404
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,280
about the industry because my background

1405
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:40,079
i have i

1406
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:42,880
did a bit of video game journalism and i

1407
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,599
cover

1408
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,400
conferences as a c3 and one of the

1409
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:46,960
things

1410
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:50,319
i i realize is like when

1411
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:53,040
a big company like microsoft is acquired

1412
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,839
some

1413
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:56,560
other studios they are acquired in these

1414
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,480
studios because of their originality

1415
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:01,280
so for me independent studios are the

1416
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,119
ones that's going to save the industry

1417
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:05,119
the industry needs

1418
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:07,680
this kind of refreshing and new stories

1419
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,680
and they're going like to mix up because

1420
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,920
one they have the resources to provide

1421
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:13,359
to the developers

1422
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:15,599
and also the developers have like this

1423
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:17,040
creativity

1424
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,200
that sometimes they don't have like the

1425
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:20,960
the economic possibilities to

1426
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,680
to create so this is a mix-up where

1427
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:25,599
beautiful things can happen

1428
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,079
and also i think that we are going to

1429
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,160
move into a space when everyone can be a

1430
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,160
creator because you have tools like

1431
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,280
dreams and you have

1432
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,640
like uh tools that

1433
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,880
you can create a game without needing to

1434
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,200
be like a coder because another

1435
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,520
uh pressure is about creating a game and

1436
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,119
being a developer is that you need to

1437
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,000
code

1438
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,319
and me there are a lot of roles that you

1439
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:50,079
can assume when producing a game

1440
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:52,720
so i think that part of the shop is like

1441
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:53,599
to

1442
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:55,920
make people realize that they can work

1443
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,599
in the game industry and they can

1444
00:45:57,599 --> 00:45:59,359
enter the game industry and not

1445
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,599
necessarily be like a coder or an

1446
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,160
artist maybe you write beautiful stories

1447
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,480
so you can contribute from from there

1448
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:09,760
and also from the video game industry

1449
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,960
standpoint is that you realize this

1450
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,200
you they are going to realize that they

1451
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,359
need this refreshing quality

1452
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:20,240
of originality from creators and the

1453
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,960
diverse

1454
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,720
backgrounds with the diverse backgrounds

1455
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,359
yeah i think that that makes plenty of

1456
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:28,800
sense thank you all like for engaging

1457
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,000
with that conversation

1458
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,200
and i know one of the things that i

1459
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
always try to try to tell folks i'm like

1460
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:34,240
okay

1461
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
the stereotypical narrative is like okay

1462
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,480
sure like it's not that it's not true

1463
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,079
it's that we don't have like enough

1464
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,160
alternative narratives so that

1465
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:43,839
audiences who don't know enough about

1466
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,440
our populations you know

1467
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,280
won't just believe that that's who we

1468
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,560
are all the time right so i'm thinking

1469
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,200
about like

1470
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,119
you know like think about like gta and

1471
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:52,319
showing like you know like struggle

1472
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,760
classes of like you know black and

1473
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:55,599
latinx like folks or whatever

1474
00:46:55,599 --> 00:46:59,119
um uh and i'm like sure yeah we know

1475
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:00,800
drug dealers you know i got drug dealers

1476
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:01,760
like in my family

1477
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:04,240
but we're more than that you know like

1478
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:04,800
you know

1479
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,560
we have you know there are professors in

1480
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,079
my family they're like you know

1481
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:10,240
people who you know working class folks

1482
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,839
like in my family you know so i guess i

1483
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:12,319
just

1484
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:14,240
i don't i wish that we could get away

1485
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,400
from like that limited narrative right

1486
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,800
um because we are our populations and

1487
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,319
our communities are so much more

1488
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,520
than than the stereotypes yeah

1489
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,800
we are like uh almost 13 minutes we have

1490
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:27,839
13 minutes

1491
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:30,160
but i i didn't want to go without asking

1492
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:32,640
you about the future of video games

1493
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:35,359
because one of the things that i'm super

1494
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,040
interested in doing research about

1495
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,760
is the metaverse and this kind of new

1496
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,640
step

1497
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:42,800
uh this involving step from internet

1498
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,160
that mixes

1499
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,800
uh social media platforms and gaming and

1500
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,800
create this kind of virtual worlds

1501
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,680
united but also like all in the same

1502
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,000
place

1503
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,160
that's this kind of all-encompassing

1504
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,040
space

1505
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,000
and there are thought as really

1506
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,359
immersive space

1507
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,800
and places where people can have all the

1508
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,880
different aspects of their life but

1509
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,400
recreate in a digital

1510
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,880
setup with all the problematic things

1511
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:09,440
about

1512
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:13,040
being living a digital life that is

1513
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,720
privatized because you're going to play

1514
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,559
it and be in a private

1515
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:20,160
space and what do you think about

1516
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,480
the future of video games and futurism

1517
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:24,079
video games is like

1518
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,599
do you see a connection between these

1519
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,240
two topics

1520
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:32,160
maze do you want to go because i can i

1521
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:36,399
can jump on in there if you want

1522
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:40,960
okay okay um i think about this a lot

1523
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,680
because i think about afrofuturism a lot

1524
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:44,720
right

1525
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:48,800
um but i think um

1526
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,280
the industry as it's currently

1527
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:52,880
constructed

1528
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:55,200
is not prepared or equipped with the

1529
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,280
tools to be able to create

1530
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,319
um diverse futures that really make

1531
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:00,960
sense for

1532
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:03,680
our populations right um because right

1533
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,400
now

1534
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,800
sure you know dei okay diversity equity

1535
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,400
and inclusion okay i feel like that

1536
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,400
that's like the um

1537
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:12,480
that's that's like the easy way out

1538
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:13,839
right so

1539
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:15,599
we see now a lot of the industry they

1540
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,240
don't mind like making statements like

1541
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,400
stop asian hate or black lives matter

1542
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,599
right that's like

1543
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:23,920
it's like part of their brands now right

1544
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:25,359
it's like um

1545
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:27,280
it's cool now so they don't mind doing

1546
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,440
it right so i'm just thinking about you

1547
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:30,880
know all those companies all those

1548
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:32,079
gaming companies

1549
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:33,760
that put out like you know black lives

1550
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,599
matter statements or put out you know um

1551
00:49:35,599 --> 00:49:37,920
language in support of um uh you know

1552
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,000
like the violence against like asian um

1553
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,200
populations

1554
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,079
they haven't done much else right but

1555
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:45,760
that's part of like the dei

1556
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,200
approach that's a part of like you know

1557
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,720
well but we'll just cr you know put

1558
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:49,440
these statements

1559
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,440
we'll hire a few folks we'll do this but

1560
00:49:51,440 --> 00:49:53,040
there's not

1561
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,800
real change right some people say that

1562
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,720
that's incremental change i disagree i

1563
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,160
don't think that that's changed at all

1564
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,839
i think that they're just like placating

1565
00:49:59,839 --> 00:50:01,520
right and they're just you know trying

1566
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:02,720
to like do things you know there's

1567
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,040
putting band-aids on like wounds right

1568
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,640
because you know there are part of like

1569
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:08,559
these legacies and the vestiges of like

1570
00:50:08,559 --> 00:50:10,400
you know racialized institutions and

1571
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,599
you know they're part of like you know

1572
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:12,960
the structure you know supporting and

1573
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:14,720
upholding like white supremacy

1574
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:16,559
um and if like you know they can't like

1575
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:18,480
address those kinds of things then

1576
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:20,000
you know the future's still gonna be

1577
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,079
problematic like you know i really

1578
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,079
didn't think well you know i'm i'm just

1579
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,760
gonna say the statement but i don't know

1580
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,839
but but i'm just thinking about the

1581
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:29,599
conversations that we're having now are

1582
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,240
conversations that we had 10 years ago

1583
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:33,920
and what what i heard from other folks

1584
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,000
that they had 10 years prior to that

1585
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,440
like so the conversations aren't

1586
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,119
evolving and aren't changing

1587
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:40,480
you know we're still thinking about you

1588
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,400
know how to get like women and girls

1589
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,319
into like stem because of the leaky

1590
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:46,079
piping stem you know why can't we keep

1591
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:48,079
them right why can't why won't they stay

1592
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,160
you know but we're not thinking we're

1593
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:52,079
also individualizing

1594
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:53,440
you know a lot of these problems and

1595
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:55,040
saying well if we can and it's also

1596
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,000
blaming the victim

1597
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:58,079
like think about like how much pressure

1598
00:50:58,079 --> 00:50:59,680
is like on the oppressed

1599
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:02,000
is like on us to have to do something

1600
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,839
about our oppression

1601
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:05,760
why do we have to be the ones educating

1602
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,520
folks why do we have to be the ones that

1603
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,240
to say

1604
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,760
okay well you're messing up don't do

1605
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,839
that that's a misstep don't like

1606
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,960
these folks are not they're not

1607
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,960
they're not dumb you know these folks

1608
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,000
are like some among

1609
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,680
like the most brilliant minds like in

1610
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,839
the world but they can't figure out how

1611
00:51:21,839 --> 00:51:23,680
to fix these problems like to me that's

1612
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,319
like that's

1613
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:27,599
willful right that they want to be there

1614
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,079
they have a continued investment or you

1615
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,119
know just like you know professor

1616
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:32,480
lipsticks might say this they have this

1617
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,000
possessive investment in white

1618
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:34,960
masculinity

1619
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,480
and upholding and supporting those so if

1620
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,079
we think about like the future

1621
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,599
we haven't dismantled like the

1622
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,280
foundation that that

1623
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:44,319
that grew that grew this right the roots

1624
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,119
are bad

1625
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:46,319
everything about like a tree you know

1626
00:51:46,319 --> 00:51:48,000
we're trying to say okay well the pretty

1627
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:49,359
leaves are gonna come soon

1628
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,040
but the pretty true you know the pretty

1629
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:52,960
leaves are going to be from

1630
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,000
damaged roots

1631
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:57,839
and to me we have to uproot the whole

1632
00:51:57,839 --> 00:51:59,520
tree and we have to start over and we

1633
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,440
have to start over like in a way that

1634
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:04,079
um that incorporates us from jump that

1635
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,760
values us from jump now you see like

1636
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:06,880
different like you know

1637
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:08,400
uh different companies you know trying

1638
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:09,920
to like do this kind of stuff

1639
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:11,920
but i think that if we don't have like a

1640
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,440
massive overhaul we're just going to

1641
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,319
continue to see

1642
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,920
a lot of the same i'm sorry i wish that

1643
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,480
was like more hopeful i'm sorry that

1644
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:18,880
that's

1645
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:21,280
like but i i just have to be real about

1646
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,559
what what i see

1647
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,880
the future is like in this moment too

1648
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,119
absolutely we are still paying the the

1649
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,359
the consequences of gamergate and we're

1650
00:52:29,359 --> 00:52:31,520
still seeing this kind of culture

1651
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:34,400
that is embedded into the gaming culture

1652
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:34,960
and

1653
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,839
for me uh from women in games argentina

1654
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,359
and the topics and the things we

1655
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:40,720
participate in

1656
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,319
it's like we are trying to like

1657
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,359
educate on twitter and trying to tell

1658
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:47,839
other

1659
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:51,280
people like okay having this uh

1660
00:52:51,280 --> 00:52:53,119
female character that is on a chambel

1661
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,720
bikini is not inclusion

1662
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:56,640
it's not like you have a woman character

1663
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,839
is that is not

1664
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,640
representation having a woman character

1665
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,839
is not representation

1666
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:04,480
so we are still fighting these battles

1667
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:05,520
we're still

1668
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,400
hearing the same arguments that are uh

1669
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,200
coming from

1670
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,760
the gamergate and for me it's also

1671
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:12,960
problematic that

1672
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,440
this kind of narrative had expanded to

1673
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:16,559
politics

1674
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:19,040
and we see some arguments that were held

1675
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,200
in gamergate that were sustained

1676
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,240
with people uh followers in like the u.s

1677
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,559
presidential election campaign of trump

1678
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,400
and we see these kind of narratives

1679
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:29,119
replicated

1680
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:31,520
in the twitch channels and the followers

1681
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,359
of these these narratives

1682
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:36,559
so for me this is bad but but i try to

1683
00:53:36,559 --> 00:53:38,319
keep like this future of hope

1684
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,200
and that we can create spaces for for

1685
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,359
new games and new narratives and

1686
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:46,640
like continue to make noise about this

1687
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,000
and can kind of continue to make people

1688
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:50,480
aware

1689
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:52,720
about the potential of of games of

1690
00:53:52,720 --> 00:53:53,680
gaming

1691
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:55,920
and i don't know if you may you want to

1692
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,880
chime in uh

1693
00:53:56,880 --> 00:54:00,800
to these or i i if not i

1694
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,280
it's totally fine i definitely want to

1695
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:04,160
chime in now

1696
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:07,280
um just after how you both um were

1697
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:08,400
taking up the topic

1698
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:09,599
i just i couldn't gather my thoughts

1699
00:54:09,599 --> 00:54:10,640
because they all went in a billion

1700
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,599
different directions

1701
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:13,839
about you know virtual virtual worlds

1702
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:15,200
the metaverse moving forward

1703
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,640
all of these like really really really

1704
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,559
big questions that a lot of

1705
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,720
um companies and individuals are going

1706
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,640
to be tackling over the next few years

1707
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,520
and beyond um but i think i just want to

1708
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,559
echo what keyshawn

1709
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:28,640
said kind of at the end there was like

1710
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:29,920
the roots are bad

1711
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,079
you know and this this goes down to the

1712
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:33,200
very

1713
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
you know bottom of this whole process of

1714
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,839
what it means to operate within virtual

1715
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:40,079
spaces like the ones and zeros

1716
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,799
the binary you know black and white yes

1717
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:43,440
no

1718
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,880
affirmative you know unaffirmative

1719
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:49,920
um it's just too limiting it's too

1720
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,000
it's too um prescriptive i think we need

1721
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,520
a new dimension

1722
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,160
or two or three for which we approach

1723
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:58,559
these

1724
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,960
um concepts so that's what i'll say i

1725
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,480
mean i'm really

1726
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:08,160
i'm really um interested to see how

1727
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:10,240
um not only indigenous communities and

1728
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,559
cultures you know as diverse as we are

1729
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,119
think about the universe and think about

1730
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:17,280
reality and think about virtual

1731
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,480
space in relation to reality um

1732
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,319
because i think a lot of really fruitful

1733
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,079
discussions and alternatives to

1734
00:55:24,079 --> 00:55:26,160
kind of how our mindset is kind of

1735
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,319
framed in this

1736
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:32,000
you know westernized hegemonic system

1737
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,599
but then also you know the voices of

1738
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:35,280
other diverse um

1739
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:36,960
perspectives as well are super super

1740
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,200
important um not just culturally but

1741
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,000
you know thinking along gender lines and

1742
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:42,400
um

1743
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,760
thinking along uh like economic lines

1744
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:46,079
too

1745
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,280
like i think that that's something that

1746
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:48,480
we haven't really talked about much

1747
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,160
either in this conversation is like

1748
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,640
the stratification that we're seeing

1749
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:53,680
around the world

1750
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,160
you know uh of the ultra witch and the

1751
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,359
ultra poor

1752
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,839
um is just getting further and further

1753
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,160
with less and less space in between

1754
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,920
and i think games are

1755
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,799
pretty inaccessible still and something

1756
00:56:08,799 --> 00:56:10,240
that i'm really passionate about making

1757
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,200
more

1758
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:13,280
um you know accessible in the future so

1759
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,119
i'll kind of just leave it at that like

1760
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:16,799
when i when i think about them i have a

1761
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:17,920
i have trouble thinking about the

1762
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,440
metaverse because i

1763
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:20,799
i just hear metaverse i think

1764
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,359
inaccessible

1765
00:56:23,359 --> 00:56:25,040
uh there are so many topics that i

1766
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:26,799
wanted to talk to you we should need

1767
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,960
like five more hours because

1768
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:30,880
as you were saying we didn't enter into

1769
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,079
like the

1770
00:56:32,079 --> 00:56:34,079
the economics of these and the

1771
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:35,680
accessibility to the consoles and the

1772
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,799
accessibility to

1773
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,200
pcs i have heard in an interview kishona

1774
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,760
that you were talking about how

1775
00:56:41,760 --> 00:56:44,960
you uh study console gaming because you

1776
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:46,400
didn't have access to a pc

1777
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,119
when you were growing up and that's

1778
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:50,160
that's very limiting

1779
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:52,799
i did on my site i didn't have access to

1780
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,920
a console when i

1781
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,040
until i was like in my late 20s and for

1782
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:57,520
me this

1783
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:59,839
is also we didn't raise to the point of

1784
00:56:59,839 --> 00:57:01,680
sustainability and the impact that is

1785
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,720
having on the planet

1786
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:04,640
this massive consumption of electricity

1787
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,480
going around in creating

1788
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,480
this uh and sustaining these gaming

1789
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,400
environments we are almost

1790
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,960
at three minutes time to to end this

1791
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,599
talk

1792
00:57:13,599 --> 00:57:16,240
which which i wish did it didn't end

1793
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,000
because it's fascinating to talk to all

1794
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:18,799
of you

1795
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:20,799
and i i would love to end with like a

1796
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:22,319
quick question it's like

1797
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:24,000
mace i know that you have already

1798
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,400
created a game but

1799
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,559
what will be your next project on

1800
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:30,240
kishona if you are going to create a

1801
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,040
game

1802
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:34,319
what game would be and how that it would

1803
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:36,799
look like

1804
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,400
i'll go first um i there's nothing in

1805
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,000
the works right now unfortunately

1806
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,640
i actually recently started um a

1807
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:45,839
position

1808
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,160
at unity technologies which is the big

1809
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,359
you know game

1810
00:57:49,359 --> 00:57:51,520
engine um a couple months back and i've

1811
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:53,359
been really like pouring all my

1812
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:56,559
heart and soul into joining the industry

1813
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,400
and seeing how like the other world

1814
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,000
works outside of academia

1815
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,599
um that was kind of a goal of mine when

1816
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,440
i wrapped up my master's

1817
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:05,359
was to just like see what the industry

1818
00:58:05,359 --> 00:58:07,040
was like and get that percent experience

1819
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,599
and it's been

1820
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,599
it's been great with unity so far so

1821
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:11,760
nothing super creative in the works at

1822
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,760
the moment unfortunately but

1823
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,680
i am super you know passionate about

1824
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,119
having these conversations with folks

1825
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:17,839
like you

1826
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:21,359
um just chatting talking connecting

1827
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:23,839
building um you know a network of people

1828
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:26,240
having these types of conversations

1829
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:28,400
and also just like i see my role now

1830
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:29,839
that i've kind of been there and done

1831
00:58:29,839 --> 00:58:31,599
that and created a game

1832
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,400
um supporting other up and comers as

1833
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:34,799
well

1834
00:58:34,799 --> 00:58:36,799
i think i'm super passionate about like

1835
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:38,880
there's a whole indigenous

1836
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:42,400
video game developer community that

1837
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,720
is just is just you know growing right

1838
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,240
now and it's really cool to see all the

1839
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:47,599
work that's that's coming out of that

1840
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:49,440
those folks and yeah i just i want

1841
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:51,040
nothing more than to support them and

1842
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,319
make sure that they're creating awesome

1843
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,040
stuff and

1844
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:55,760
they have the tools and the ability um

1845
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,480
to do that

1846
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,400
so that's kind of it for me at this

1847
00:58:58,400 --> 00:58:59,920
point um

1848
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,240
but i would love to to make to make more

1849
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:03,200
stuff um

1850
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,559
in the near future um

1851
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,520
that was beautiful maze um i think i'm

1852
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:10,559
i'm not about

1853
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:12,400
creating content and producing things

1854
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:13,760
just for the sake of doing it just

1855
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:14,640
because i can

1856
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,520
right um and so i do it because i might

1857
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:18,079
see

1858
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:20,720
some voids or see some gaps or see some

1859
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,480
areas for improvement or areas for

1860
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,200
development

1861
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:25,680
but i think you know gaming is in good

1862
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,760
hands if like you know if we follow the

1863
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:29,359
recommendations that you know michaela

1864
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,799
made of like really focusing on like you

1865
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:32,400
know the indie scene the independent

1866
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,400
scene of seeing all the amazing stuff so

1867
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,720
now i can see myself i can see

1868
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:38,079
narratives of from like diverse

1869
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:39,040
perspectives so

1870
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,799
you know i think that was you know if

1871
00:59:40,799 --> 00:59:42,240
you would have asked me this maybe like

1872
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:43,520
15 years ago

1873
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:44,799
it would have been like a different

1874
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:45,920
answer i would have been like i want to

1875
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,200
make a game that does a b

1876
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:49,359
c and d right but i've seen that terra

1877
00:59:49,359 --> 00:59:50,880
nova you know so many other like

1878
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:51,440
examples

1879
00:59:51,440 --> 00:59:53,920
you know so i i'm not compelled to do

1880
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,520
that but i'm gonna just echo what maze

1881
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:56,240
