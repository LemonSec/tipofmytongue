transparency reports and now also gives

00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:30,640
access

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,680
to this event about transparency

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,120
reporting

16
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,199
and thanks for inviting the elia company

although i understand our reporting is

18
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,000
one of the most read

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,120
pieces on our homepage it's difficult

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,360
for me to know

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,079
what you watching this event are looking

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,280
for

23
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,480
and how therefore for us to improve

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280
so please have a look and give us

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,239
feedback

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,280
on how to improve

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,119
both positives and negatives thanks

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
atelia company we say law enforcement

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,320
disclosure reporting and not

30
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,240
transparency report

31
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,360
because we do transparency in all

32
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
areas of sustainability that might be

33
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:24,400
children's rights or environment or our

34
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:26,720
work in the supply chain

35
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,400
gender equality and so forth

36
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,840
and also on human rights impact

37
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,320
assessments

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,799
the following are the two starting

39
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,759
points for

40
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,640
tla companies reporting first and

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,600
foremost

42
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
we encourage states to be

43
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:48,240
transparent themselves about their use

44
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,159
and scope of surveillance we welcome

45
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,079
therefore the yearly transparency

46
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,280
reports published by the governments

47
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,320
in such as

48
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,439
sweden denmark finland norway and

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:05,040
lithuania

50
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,800
so please do encourage states to do

51
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
transparency reporting to supplement

52
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:12,879
those

53
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,480
reports from states our aim

54
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,360
at taylor company is to contribute to

55
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,480
meaningful

56
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
and oversight and discussion

57
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:28,160
so we publish these reports twice a year

58
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,560
a full report with context and other

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,080
information

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,080
each march and then an update of the law

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,040
enforcement

62
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,720
requests each october and we've done so

63
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,000
since 2013.

64
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
secondly as a side effect our work to be

65
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,040
transparent helps us

66
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:52,319
in getting things in order because when

67
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,200
we publish

68
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,319
information it needs to be correct

69
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,959
over the years we've added additional

70
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,080
transparency

71
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,800
to the actual statistics of law

72
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
enforcement

73
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,560
requests so in in addition to

74
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,560
our statistics statistics on the

75
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,360
day-to-day thousands of conventional

76
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,760
lawful intercept requests we also

77
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,040
provide information on

78
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,360
unconventional requests and the number

79
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,400
of such

80
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,800
that's about blocking shutdowns new

81
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,040
legislation etc

82
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,519
and how we have dealt with those

83
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
secondly we have added links to laws

84
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,360
providing states with direct access

85
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:36,480
three we have also added links to laws

86
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,480
mandating operators to do

87
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,480
data retention for surveillance

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,480
we have also added the links to the

89
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,720
government's own reporting

90
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,319
and we've added information on the

91
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,519
extent of use of

92
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:55,360
cell tower dumps and lots of context

93
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,040
and more so i invite you to have a look

94
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,439
into our latest march

95
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,840
2020 report one feature

96
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,000
of talia companies reporting which i

97
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,319
don't know if other companies do

98
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,519
is that our figures are audited just is

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,640
our financials

100
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:18,560
so deloitte look into our figures

101
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,440
and also ask sometimes about supporting

102
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,320
documentation

103
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,240
so that they can audit our figures

104
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,520
so which are the main challenges as to

105
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
this reporting we have a chapter in our

106
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,440
march report on challenges

107
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,800
and omissions the biggest challenge

108
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,240
notably is that the statistics on number

109
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,320
of surveillance requests

110
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,560
don't provide the full picture

111
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,000
governments also have

112
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,120
direct access real-time network access

113
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,400
without requests regarding such direct

114
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,120
access

115
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,080
till a company has no insight into the

116
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,759
extent of surveillance

117
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,360
when who and what and cannot provide

118
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:02,560
statistics

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,520
what we can do as we do in our reporting

120
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,680
is to publish links to such relevant

121
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,560
laws

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,600
in our respective markets and as part of

123
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,520
the global network initiative the gni

124
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,160
we address this salient issue of direct

125
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,919
access

126
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,759
another challenge i wanted to mention

127
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,400
here is that some readers try to compare

128
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,360
figures

129
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,639
between the countries several factors

130
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,759
make it

131
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,440
difficult to compare the statistics

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,199
between countries

133
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,800
thalia of course had have different

134
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,800
market shares in different markets

135
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,160
and also the working methods within the

136
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,720
authorities differ and we don't know

137
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,440
about

138
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,639
their priorities and working with us

139
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,160
so a very short summary thanks accessnow

140
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,280
for arranging this important event

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,400
i myself look forward to

142
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,639
look at the stream on our reporting

143
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,199
first why we do it well our

144
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,319
responsibility

145
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,360
is to respect your privacy

146
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,360
but there are laws which mandate

147
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,960
us to hand over data for surveillance

148
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,240
what we can do is to be transparent

149
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
about that how many requests we get and

150
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,800
the context about

151
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,840
on such requests some things

152
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,720
i try to highlight in this intervention

153
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,600
one is that

154
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,800
telia company statistics is audited

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,080
and also a main challenge for

156
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,120
transparency

157
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:38,160
is direct access where we cannot provide

158
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,759
statistics

159
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,880
so do give us feedback positive

160
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,960
negative and on how we can improve

161
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,400
my twitter handle is pottwick underscore

162
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
hisselius many thanks

163
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:00,318
and take care thanks
