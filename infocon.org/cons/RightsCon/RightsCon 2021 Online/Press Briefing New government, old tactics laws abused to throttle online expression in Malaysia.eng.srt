00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,879
briefing today

68
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,720
my organization the center for

69
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,319
independent journalism

70
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,879
um is a civil society organization as

71
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,120
well as a media watchdog

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,280
and our work is grounded in promoting

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,800
freedom of expression

74
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,560
right to information and free media

75
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,680
so in that context what i would share

76
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,400
with you with everyone today is a

77
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
snapshot of

78
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,000
the freedom of expression landscape in

79
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:50,879
malaysia

80
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,879
and of course this is located within the

81
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,879
context of our continuing political

82
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:55,680
turmoil

83
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
as well as kovate 19. in 2019

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,840
um you know following the last or the

85
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,599
14th general election

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,840
which actually resulted in the

87
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,239
opposition coalition pakitan harappan

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,760
coming into power

89
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,040
we saw more of an opening of space and

90
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
also some level of cautious optimism i

91
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,040
would say

92
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,840
with regards to our part towards reform

93
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
yeah

94
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,680
this of course um all changed um

95
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,799
you know at the end of february 2020

96
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,760
where through rather i would say

97
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,920
unprecedented

98
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,480
machinations you know known here in

99
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,360
malaysia

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,120
and i think even now globally as the

101
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,560
sheraton move

102
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,120
we entered into a political turmoil

103
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,000
which you know

104
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,480
has resulted in a new government and a

105
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,519
new coalition

106
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,720
led by uh prime minister muy den yassin

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:49,200
now this new government you know formed

108
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,599
through precarious alliances

109
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:54,239
has resulted in a situation where the

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,200
government

111
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,599
is attempting to prop up its positions

112
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,000
by stifling criticism and descent and

113
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
this is what we are seeing

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
and on top of that the government has

115
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
used the kobe 19 pandemic

116
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,680
to justify the very severe measures that

117
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,239
it has

118
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,080
you know has been adopting the

119
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,920
crackdowns the intimidation the

120
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,238
harassments that we have seen yeah

121
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,560
and one of the most severe measure i

122
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,320
would say is the actual

123
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,919
proclamation of an emergency on 11th of

124
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,919
january 2021 this

125
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
this year right which has in effect

126
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,320
suspended parliament

127
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,720
and has also empowered the prime

128
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,919
minister to enact

129
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,000
ordinances which circumvents

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,919
parliamentary debates

131
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,320
uh what we have seen now um you know

132
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
amongst the few ordinances which has uh

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,360
which has been

134
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,240
enacted is the enactment of the

135
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,120
emergency

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,479
um ordinance number two um which came

137
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,840
into effect on the 12th of march 2021

138
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,680
and which is actually intended to

139
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,440
criminalize fake news

140
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,639
uh um relating to kobe 19

141
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:03,680
and or the emergency proclamation so

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,479
this is now

143
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,440
has set the the the landscape the

144
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
environment you know to curb freedom of

145
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,080
expression and speech

146
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,360
being in this perpetual lockdown in some

147
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,120
different forms of lockdown since march

148
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:19,600
2020

149
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,280
what we have seen is a larger

150
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,320
um constituent of a larger number of

151
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,280
people

152
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,520
moving towards online spaces for

153
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,320
communications for exchange of ideas you

154
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,800
know

155
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,840
imparting or seeking information this

156
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,320
then

157
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,600
is the the backdrop that has also set

158
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,800
the trend

159
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,520
and the pattern uh or rather the

160
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,039
prevalence that we see

161
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,759
in the course of the last um say 15

162
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,880
months or so

163
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,440
of silencing descent various forms of

164
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:52,720
expression

165
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,039
and this is actually to a large extent

166
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,440
escalating because it's not just

167
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,120
civil society i mean human rights

168
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,199
defenders or media

169
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,280
or you know they're also attacks against

170
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,639
gender-based expressions

171
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,440
attacks and use of religion to undermine

172
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,960
freedom of expression

173
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,160
i'm sure uh my other uh uh panelists

174

181
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,160
writes con access now malaysia still

182
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:34,720
labels

183
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,360
under laws curtailing freedom of speech

184
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,160
and expression

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,919
and we still have the colonial legacy

186
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,960
and the sedition act

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,240
that allows for prosecution

188
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
on statements against the royalty and

189
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,280
government

190
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,840
the communications and multimedia act

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,319
penalizes annoying and offensive

192
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,520
posts on the internet family reza's

193
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,680
experience is an example

194
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,560
the printing presses publications act

195
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,280
regulates

196
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,800
print media and books the home minister

197
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
has the absolute discretion to ban books

198
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,560
it deems unfit

199
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,599
for public consumption on the basis of

200
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,800
national security and public order the

201
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,919
courts still rely on an archaic contempt

202
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,880
of court

203
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,639
law that penalizes or

204
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,319
is used purportedly to protect its

205
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,520
dignity and its institution and stephen

206
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,960
from malaysia kimi

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,000
will elaborate on that example

208
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,120
but tellingly the most

209
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,319
controversial enlightenment recently

210
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:45,360
has been emergence of the fake news

211
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
ordinance

212
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,120
under the emergency laws it reenacts a

213
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,360
law that was actually repealed by

214
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,000
the previous pakitan harappan government

215
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:54,479
and it's

216
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,280
now been revived under the pretext of

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
protecting

218
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,800
or promoting the fight against kovite 19

219
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,479
in an emergency

220
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,199
there are at least five main objections

221
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,560
against this fake

222
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,319
news ordinance one it is too broad

223
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,960
any information regarding kovit any

224
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,240
information regarding the

225
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,360
emergency may be deemed as news that is

226
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:19,759
fake

227
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,120
and punishable under the law two

228
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,520
anyone can go to court on an ex-party

229
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:28,240
basis in the absence of the other party

230
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,440
to have the court order remove

231
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,479
that piece of legisl that piece of news

232
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:36,880
that is purportedly fake so you go to

233
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,958
court without a challenge

234
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,760
for the piece of news that that is on on

235
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:42,958
the website

236
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,160
and three if the applicant

237
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,600
goes to court to seek that the

238
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,320
article be removed you cannot challenge

239
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,880
it

240
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,360
no one can come to court and say look

241
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:55,920
that

242
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,040
order to remove is wrong for

243
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
the fine and jail penalty goes up to

244
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,760
100 000 ringgit and up to six years

245
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
imprisonment that's excessive five

246
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,240
any news portal or social media platform

247
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,920
or third party commentators

248
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,600
intermediaries

249
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,200
can also be liable under this law

250
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,279
and this is a overly broad and is

251
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,600
unproportionate or disproportionate

252
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:28,320
and goes against any principle that we

253
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,080
know of under international human rights

254
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,120
law

255
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,519

we've been around for more than 20 years

273
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
malay zucchini went live

274
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,880
a year after google was launched i think

275
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:22,079
while we're not as successful as google

276
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,760
we are one of the few startups that have

277
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,519
done pretty well i think

278
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:29,279
in this part of the world um we are a

279
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
subscription-based website and our

280
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,279
income

281
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,959
rely mostly on the support of our our

282
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:40,240
supporters and our readers

283
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,800
now working in an environment which is

284
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:43,680
particularly

285
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,680
hostile for media organizations like

286
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,000
malaysia guinea has not been

287
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
easy for all of us but somehow we are

288
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,320
able to survive

289
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,760
through the years we've been raided by

290
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
the police well last time i checked it's

291
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,399
about

292
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,519
five times over the years uh

293
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
arrested a number of times as well uh

294
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,560
and we faced debilitating uh

295
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,760
cyber attacks and the like um

296
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,800
the latest was the contempt of court uh

297
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,079
charge against malaysia guinea

298
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,079
where we will find a hefty half a

299
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,680
million ringgit

300
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,959
that's about 120 000

301
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,640
us dollars but thank goodness

302
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,079
the amount was we are able to thankfully

303
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:28,480
uh

304
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,480
you know able to raise uh through

305
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,760
crowdfunding

306
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:35,279
uh within a few hours um now that

307
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,320
that charge was uh based on

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,600
uh comments that was made uh

309
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:44,399
by our subscribers uh in our comment

310
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,120
comment

311
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,320
page uh comment section and uh

312
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,160
apparently uh some of the comments were

313
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,760
that were critical critical of

314
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:57,120
the judiciary the judges were not uh

315
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,720
were not happy about that

316
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,399
it went straight to the federal court

317
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,399
which is the highest court

318
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,360
in the country so there is actually no

319
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,160
recourse for appeal

320
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,760
and that we were found duty of that

321
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,800
uh we were given a few days i think

322
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:15,920
three days to pay

323
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,959
that fine and if we were not able to

324
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:20,160
raise that money

325
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,959
um we would uh we will have problems

326
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,880
continuing

327
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,519
our you know the organization so

328
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,320
so i think you know basically uh i

329
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,600
consider that

330
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,519
uh perhaps you know an attempt to also

331
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,560
uh to stop us from from continuing on

332
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,600
and they've been you know other

333
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,800
cases of attempt of harassment and all

334
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,000
that

335
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,959
thankfully again we able to uh survive

336
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:55,920
that

337
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,480
now the many restrictive laws that we

338
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,320
face in malaysia

339
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
definitely do impede our work

340
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,680
but i guess however difficult the

341
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,720
situation is

342
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,760
it does not stop us from

343
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,160
continuing our our to carry out a task

344
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,040

there's an opportunity or there's any

514
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,200
chance for the government to repeal it

515
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
as soon as possible

516
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,280
okay um thank you for the question

517
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,480
nalini

518
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:13,600
we to contextualize it when the first

519
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,960
fake news um

520
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:19,520
act was um uh adopted it was to counter

521
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,039
and silence critics

522
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,760
by the you know just two governments

523
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:24,559
before us

524
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:27,840
yeah and it was uh repealed and i think

525
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
that was one of the most

526
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,400
um progressive move made by the

527
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,600
the pakitan harapan government

528
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,360
but then if we bring it back to our

529
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,280
current context what we see

530
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,760
is basically a government and it's like

531
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,520
almost like a house of cards right

532
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,480
very shaky foundation that can collapse

533
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,720
if shaken or questioned too much

534
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,919
so this um ordinance um

535
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,559
is another manifestation or rather a

536
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,280
tool

537
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,679
to stop any attempts of critical

538
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,400
questioning

539
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,480
or challenging the authorities of the

540
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:02,799
scale i mean that's clearly what is

541
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:03,600
being used

542
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000
and it's being used against uh

543
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,080
laypersons you know the general public

544
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,919
if you look at the number of cases

545
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:10,640
that's been

546
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,480
investigated in the last couple of

547
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,840
months you know 21 odd cases have been

548
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,159
investigated

549
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:19,520
um i think almost 11 cases where um they

550
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,400
were probably

551
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,600
um charged as well now

552
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,720
so the avenues for repeal in the current

553
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
context

554
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,559
is rather terrorist yeah because it is a

555
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,320
tool it's not like any other

556
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:35,600
legislation to serve a particular public

557
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,880
interest it's

558
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:40,080
so but the other opportunity so you know

559
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,400
rather than us pushing for the repeal of

560
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,679
you know or creating campaigns for the

561
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:48,960
repeal what we are really focusing on

562
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,440
is also to see how you know at the end

563
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,520
of the

564
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,720
uh emergency proclamation which is

565
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,840
at the moment you know meant to end in

566
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,640
august

567
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:03,520
yeah there is a possibility under our

568
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,559
constitution

569
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,520
where it shall cease to have effect six

570
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,000
months

571
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,760
after you know the emergency

572
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:11,679
proclamation ceases to be in force

573
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:15,120
so that is one opportunity but there is

574
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,159
um you know concern that the

575
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:21,760
avenues for repeals very very limited

576
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:27,840
because it's a political tool largely

577
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,240
great uh thank you so much uh much love

578
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,080
for me i'm i'm coming back to you on the

579
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,960
same questions

580
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,799
what is your opinion on that why you

581
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,320
think it has been bring back

582
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,679
again why

583
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,640
i maybe i want to share my problem with

584
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,039
uh

585
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:46,400
this fake news law uh

586
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,559
you know when when i was charged and

587
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,320
convicted in 2016 over

588
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,840
najib's caricature the crime was

589
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,799
actually uh

590
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,960
you know the the charge sheet yeah it

591
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,240
says i was

592
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,000
found guilty of creating and spreading

593
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,440
online content that was

594
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
false in nature with the intention of

595
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,600
hurting another person's feeling

596
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,640
and i think my cons my main concern is

597
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,159
that it is not clear how this

598
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,240
uh fake new fake news law will determine

599
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,679
what is false

600
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,120
you know uh false news or false content

601
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
yeah and and i fear it could easily be

602
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,600
used to silence uh

603
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,679
legitimate criticisms you know against

604
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:24,640
the government and

605
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,440
and works of political satire and parody

606
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,960
yeah that the government does not like

607
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,760
so

608
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,720
so it could easily be used against me

609
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,039
again

610
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,240
yeah thank you fami for sharing that and

611
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,679
i think maybe that's one of the main

612
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,480
purpose

613
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,320
coming back to the human rights lawyer

614
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,520
um edmund um

615
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:47,120
the question is like um why do you think

616
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,240
um you know using uh criminal law to

617
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,200
criminalize

618
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,799
a publication or disseminating of

619
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:55,120
misinformation

620
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,158
is a bad thing

621
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,000
there are two reasons one in malaysia we

622
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,080
have more than sufficient laws to deal

623
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,039
with

624
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,320
issues that pertain to expression and

625
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,279
speech

626
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,120
we have a lot of provisions in the penal

627
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,640
code and in fact

628
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,799
if we look at the when the internet was

629
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,640
actually established the whole regime

630
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,080
was actually established

631
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:24,080
section 233 and 211 were actually

632
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:27,360
provisions to stop mass marketing

633
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,480
campaigns

634
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,840
by companies so we the intention was to

635
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,360
stop telcos for example

636
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,480
sending you um hundreds of sms's

637
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,279
in a month asking you to sign up to

638
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,799
something asking you to take a loan

639
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:44,320
or banks asking you to to take

640
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:47,600
facilities so the idea was to stop

641
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,240
that kind of harassment that kind of

642
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,360
annoyance

643
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,919
but now 233 has been used the wrong way

644
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,760
and we have seen how it's been used

645
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:56,480
there's so much

646
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,960
analysis on it the previous bakata

647
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,799
harapan government promised to look into

648
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,320
it and repeal it but

649
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:05,440
did not and could not do that

650
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,000
we also have and remember we also have

651
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:10,880
the printing presses publications act

652
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:14,960
which actually already criminalizes

653
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,159
false news it's not fake news it's false

654
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:18,559
news

655
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:22,400
it was in 1984 that it was enacted

656
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,360
it is not good law in a sense that i do

657
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
not agree with that law

658
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
but i'm using that as a comparison

659
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,559
because

660
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:34,559
even in that law 1984 when you want to

661
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,760
prosecute somebody for false news

662
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,840
the prosecution has to show that the

663
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,200
false news was being spread maliciously

664
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,440
there's an element of malice in

665
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,480
spreading that

666
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:49,360
false news compared to the current

667
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,960
emergency ordinance

668
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:55,360
which allows for the crime of fake news

669
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:58,320
the element of male is need not required

670
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,320
to be shown by the prosecution

671
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,919
if you remember the most i think the

672
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,679
most high profile case was the late

673
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,760
irene fernandez's case

674
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,960
where she had actually sent out

675
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,400
information

676
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,440
on how detention camps were in malaysia

677
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,840
immigration camps were in malaysia how

678
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,720
badly

679
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,240
the detainees were being treated

680
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,840
and she was prosecuted under the

681
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,720
printing press's publications act for

682
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,200
so-called maliciously spreading those

683
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,240
false news

684
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:30,400
so i'm saying that there is enough laws

685
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,279
we should look at

686
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:36,159
how these laws are being implemented not

687
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:37,279
having new laws

688
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,600
but i think the second point and we've

689
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,039
always said this

690
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:44,400
you do not stop free speech you don't

691
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
stop expression if you have issues like

692
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,320
cov you have issues for public

693
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,600
discussion

694
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,919
you counter news or encounter

695
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,679
information with more expression and

696
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:54,799
more news

697
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,720
and let it be in the marketplace of

698
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,960
ideas for people to decide what

699
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,520
is something that they want to rely on

700
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:03,039
or not

701
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,240
back to you thanks edmund thank you so

later on um i'm coming to uh stephen

713
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,679
um stephen um how could this

714
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,880
law uh negatively impact independent

715
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:37,520
news

716
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,240
outlets journalists or civil society and

717
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,760
in the lead up to elections

718
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,919
and and we can foresee elections coming

719
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,320
up maybe not this year or next year but

720
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,840
how do you see this impact on on media

721
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,559
for example

722
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,159
thank you nalini um

723
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,080
as edmund has raised uh we have a slew

724
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:03,279
of uh restrictive laws in malaysia uh

725
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:04,559
last time i checked i think

726
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,679
we have a couple of dozen of laws

727
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,919
that directly or indirectly impinge on

728
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:11,200
press freedom

729
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,480
and freedom expression so the i guess

730
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:15,520
you know with

731
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:19,120
another law uh being turned into the mix

732
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,600
does not really change the way uh we

733
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:22,159
work

734
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,840
as journalists to be brutally honest

735
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,480
we we take it as just another hurdle uh

736
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,480
that we have to overcome um

737
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:34,000
to carry out our tasks um you know

738
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,960
there's already so many hurdles there so

739
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,080
this is just another one

740
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:40,240
uh no doubt i think you know the

741
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,840
anti-fake news law

742
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,440
gives the government another level of

743
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,320
control over and it's not just

744
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:48,799
just the media alone but it's also

745
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:50,960
immediate a way for them to controlling

746
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,320
activists

747
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:55,279
political political dissidents civil

748
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,080
society

749
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,279
and especially social media users um

750
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:00,799
but i think you know where there is

751
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:02,880
repression there will

752
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,600
also be resistance and i think farming

753
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,159
is uh

754
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
an excellent example and uh he's

755
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,880
an inspiration to uh to many of us uh

756
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,480
malaysians um

757
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:17,039
and while i think it is a little a

758
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,640
little harder

759
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,320
to to cow you know hardened

760
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,279
activists like farming and and also

761
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:26,720
independent media

762
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,440
uh organizations such as malaysia kini

763
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:29,760
uh

764
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,080
it may not be the case uh with social

765
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:33,360
media users

766
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,640
um despite the many failings of the

767
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,159
of social media and i think you know

768
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:39,919
there's a long list of that uh

769
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,399
we'll leave it to another discussion but

770
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,240
it's nevertheless a powerful

771
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,960
you know really powerful tool uh for

772
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,480
people to express themselves

773
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:51,360
and to mobilize public opinion this is

774
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,559
what the government

775
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:55,840
fear most but i think you know the

776
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,960
the people as always will always find

777
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:01,200
you know creative ways of uh to

778
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,159
circumvent

779
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:05,039
such uh restrictions and repression so i

780
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,320
guess you know

781
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,880
i am optimistic uh though of course you

782
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,720
know situation is getting

783
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,240
getting harder and harder and it's

784
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,760
getting worse and worse and

785
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,159
more laws are being you know being

786
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,240
implemented in order to control

787
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,559
our freedom of speech our right to

788
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
express ourselves

789
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,360
but i think you know uh malaysians will

790
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,480
as always uh will find ways to uh to to

791
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,039
to to you know to overcome you know

792
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,840
whatever

793
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,120
restrictions there are thank you

794
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,880
thank you so much steven thanks for

795
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,720
spreading that optimism and

796
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,679
good spirit to everyone here um so for

797
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,679
me i'm i'm coming back to you again i

798
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:44,880
would like to hear

799
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,679
more from you how did your work create

800
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,320
debate or discourse in the country and

801
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,919
how do you think the problematic laws

802
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,080
can impact again the debate

803
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,120
and and your work um from right

804
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,799
requesting accountability from the

805
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,720
government

806
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,279
yeah i think through my graphics you

807
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:03,919
know

808
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:05,760
graphic design you know posters and

809
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,120
visuals and graphics are

810
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,039
powerful medium of communication and

811
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,039
especially in the age of social media

812
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,880
it's so much easier for me to highlight

813
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,399
and expose you know corruption and

814
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
wrongdoing and abuse of power using

815
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:18,559
you know my my graphics to communicate

816
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,000
directly to people

817
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,559
on social media and i think with all

818
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:23,360
this

819
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:26,640
uh you know in act of police

820
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
intimidation

821
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,159
and rats and suppression i think it's

822
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,279
gonna create

823
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:33,039
a culture of fear you know a chilling

824
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,799
effect on on every

825
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:36,720
everyday citizens you know from talking

826
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,840
about uh

827
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:41,039
these issues from exposing uh uh

828
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:43,519
the the corruption and abuse of power of

829
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,679
you know the government and the people

830
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,799
in power yeah only only the the few

831
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,760
who who who are brave enough that is

832
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:52,720
willing to

833
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,120
resist and and fight back and and speak

834
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,720
out so i think

835
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,799
it's not going to be good you know um

836
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,080
when we have a culture

837
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:01,679
of censorship and self-censorship

838
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,039
because in malaysia right now most

839
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,640
people are still afraid

840
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,159
you know uh to criticize or make fun of

841
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
those people in power and political

842
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,000
satire you know

843
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,640
in malaysia it's it's a much more

844
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,799
dangerous game over here you can

845
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:19,120
get yourself arrested you know sentenced

846
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,080
to prison

847
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,039
for satire you know imagine that and but

848
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,320
that's that's malaysia right now thanks

849
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,960
mommy um

850
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:35,200
um yo i want to hear your opinion like

851
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,279
we can see that beyond this ordinance

852
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,360
the other laws including sedition

853
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,640
communication and multimedia act um

854
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,039
and computer crimes related laws are

855
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,559
being abused to continue

856
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:50,320
freedom of expression um to what extent

857
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,720
do developments in southeast asia also

858
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,360
impact

859
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,360
malaysia and you know and why some words

860
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:56,880
like whatever happening in malaysia it

861
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:57,919
could impact

862
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:01,120
um other countries and

863
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,799
yeah yeah so that that too

864
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,440
first what we need to look at would be

865
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,799
certain developments

866
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,760
which resonate you know across all

867
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
southeast asian countries

868
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,960
um one is the emphademic

869
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,279
second would be the proliferation of

870
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:20,399
disinformation

871
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,960
hate speech online gender-based violence

872
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,480
yeah and this

873
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,640
is you know the threshold might be

874
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,760
different but

875
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,679
this is very common not just in the

876
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,919
region i would say globally as well

877
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,919
but what we have in common in this

878
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,159
region is the concept of asean

879
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:37,360
brotherhood

880
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:41,120
yeah where they tend to adopt a somewhat

881
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,399
similar approach

882
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:44,880
to mainly i would say human rights

883
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:45,600
issues

884
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,840
yeah and if we look at it in three

885
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,200
different areas one

886
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,679
is the political thermal that we are

887
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:52,480
seeing

888
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,120
um and and relatedly the human rights

889
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,320
violations right

890
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,679
aside from what's happening here in

891
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:00,000
malaysia we have the coup in myanmar

892
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,799
we have authoritarian like practices in

893
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:03,840
in philippines

894
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,440
you know that's all leading to

895
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,760
prosecutions persecutions and

896
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:10,159
other forms of human rights violations

897
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:11,199
we also see

898
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:14,719
another pattern or you know a

899
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,239
a common threat show which is the

900
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:18,879
continued use of repressive laws

901
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,679
to criminalize expression yeah so not

902
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:23,679
just in malaysia in singapore we have

903
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,159
the protection from online fast food and

904
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,399
manipulation act yeah because in

905
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,520
thailand we have the

906
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,239
languages state law in myanmar there are

907
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,960
attempts to you know black card

908
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,119
telecommunications

909
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:37,839
internet blockets and so forth obviously

910
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:39,440
you know the other countries like

911
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:42,480
cambodia's la cabodia laos and vietnam

912
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,040
also has different forms of laws that

913
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,440
are being used to curtail

914
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,639
expression online right and then we have

915
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:51,119
this

916
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:54,239
elder uh intersecting element

917
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,800
of the pandemic which is you know

918
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,880
contributing to two things one

919
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:01,520
it is because the countries um and the

920
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,720
different states are

921
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,599
overwhelmed in mitigating the pandemic

922
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:06,560
there is

923
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,040
some levels of silence or you know and

924
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,800
silence often can also amount to

925
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,760
complicity

926
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:14,960
right uh so there's less critical voices

927
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,520
even in the context of myanmar you know

928
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,640
uh we would have expected are more

929
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:23,680
of um you know uh or

930
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,760
stronger voices and stronger

931
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:27,119
interventions from

932
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,640
southeast asian straight at least

933
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,800
through the asean mechanism

934
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:33,760
then we also have the pandemic now being

935
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,320
used

936
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,280
as the reason to justify you know the

937
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,520
use of these laws and the use of other

938
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,880
severe measures

939
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,200
to curtail expressions online and

940
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,480
offline too

941
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,200
so the dynamics are quite common you

942
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,880
know sometimes it's almost like

943
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,079
having uh you know uh the same

944
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,720
models of laws being replicated across

945
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,480
the different countries

946
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,599
and the worrying trend here is

947
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,800
that you know the the relationship uh

948
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,640
amongst the southeast asian countries

949
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,560
can also reflect in uh

950
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,720
you know malaysia's participation for

951
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,720
example at the global level

952
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,960
yeah so that the commitments then you

953
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,040
know there's this malaysia's quest

954
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,400
you know to uh you know to become a

955
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,480
member of the human rights council and

956
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:21,520
the upcoming

957
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:24,800
or rather very diluted pledges that they

958
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:25,520
have made

959
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,560
are not convincing enough but because

960
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,720
of the development in the region as the

961
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,320
block there's a possibility

962
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,000
higher possibility that they are going

963
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
to get elected so these

964
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,960
trends are common these trends are also

965
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:40,000
contributing

966
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,560
to a situation where things are not

967
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,320
necessarily going to change

968
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,440
through uh you know further

969
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,680
how would i say intervention i mean i

970
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
wouldn't say intervention asean don't

971
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:51,839
really intervene

972
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,320
but for uh further response that are

973
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,160
progressive from other countries

974
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,560
yeah so yeah so that's that's how we are

975
00:36:58,560 --> 00:36:59,839
looking at it

976
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,880
if i may just one minute just uh nalini

977
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:06,079
and this also i mean what i would say

978
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,359
is how these also manifest in in media

979
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,480
freedom because

980
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,960
media is often you know the first to be

981
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,079
targeted

982
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,560
right you target and you silence media

983
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,480
if you see what's happening to

984
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,520
in philippines uh and if you're seeing

985
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,119
what's happening in malaysia

986
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,680
even to a large extent in in indonesia

987
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,440
and of course myanmar is at a completely

988
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,960
different level altogether

989
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,440
yeah so this is the context and yes

990
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,880
malaysia definitely

991
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
fits itself very comfortably within this

992
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,839
context

993
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,040
thank you thank you so much and thank

994
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,640
you everyone for sharing and

995
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,200
uh i would just like to before wrap up

996
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,880
um i would like to give two to

997
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,000
two to three minutes to each is to

998
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,200
to just um what is um

999
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,440
the future of freedom of speech and

1000
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,280
expression in malaysia i would like to

1001
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:05,520
start with stephen

1002
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,960
stephen you have to unmute yourself

1003
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:12,320
sorry um well

1004
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,920
it's a good question i think um

1005
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:20,000
given the political landscape uh

1006
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:23,119
in malaysia where really you know

1007
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,720
we are going through uh a cultural war

1008
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,599
so to speak

1009
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,160
uh just like united states where you

1010
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:30,960
know

1011
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,760
we are split uh right in the middle and

1012
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,400
there is no one political party that can

1013
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,440
you know any one political coalition

1014
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,640
that can actually

1015
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:45,118
uh has you know uh

1016
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:49,440
a stable uh political power

1017
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:54,000
um i think you know you're going to see

1018
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,520
a lot more restrictions you know looking

1019
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:58,000
ahead

1020
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,800
i could not see i don't even think that

1021
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:01,280
the

1022
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,040
next general election will be able to

1023
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,000
resolve the kind of you know

1024
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:09,200
uh uncertainties uh that we are facing

1025
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:10,400
right now

1026
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,359
with no no political parties being able

1027
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,400
to you know

1028
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,599
come out on top uh you know to

1029
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:19,599
to to really claim that they have the

1030
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,520
majority of support

1031
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,160
among among malaysians yeah we are as i

1032
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,079
say split you know

1033
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,680
in all different ways uh so um

1034
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,160
um and given that you know you're gonna

1035
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:32,800
have

1036
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,880
weaker government uh they're going to

1037
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,400
feel a lot more

1038
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,440
threatened and because of that you see

1039
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,839
you know more restrictive laws being

1040
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:43,200
implemented

1041
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,079
um but you know i'm in the long term i'm

1042
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:47,680
positive i think i think

1043
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,359
that uh when malaysia guinea started 20

1044
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:52,160
years ago

1045
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:55,200
mahathir was in power and he was you

1046
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,480
know

1047
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,040
and definitely someone who does not

1048
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,359
broke any descent

1049
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,760
and you know at that time he never even

1050
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,599
thought that there would be a change on

1051
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,560
government

1052
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,200
uh i you know i myself did not think

1053
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:09,599
that

1054
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,520
i would see a change of government in my

1055
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
own lifetime

1056
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,359
so i think you know in that sense we see

1057
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:16,990
some progression there

1058
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:18,960
[Music]

1059
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,839
that you know eventually uh leading to a

1060
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:23,599
change of government unfortunately

1061
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:26,720
that did not last but um but i

1062
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,359
i still i i'm confident that you know if

1063
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,359
uh malaysian continue to

1064
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:34,400
to work together um you know

1065
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,240
and find ways to uh to overcome you know

1066
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:38,960
whatever

1067
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:40,800
uh problems that we're facing uh

1068
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,440
whatever you know the

1069
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,040
problems that the government is throwing

1070
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
at us um we'll be able to uh prevail

1071
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:48,640
again

1072
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,359
so i think in that sense in long term

1073
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,800
eventually

1074
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,800
we shall we shall win again

1075
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,200
thank you so much stephen edmund

1076
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:07,599
i i think that the efforts to

1077
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:09,760
curtail and censor speech and expression

1078
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:11,599
will always fail

1079
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,800
there will be many attempts and we see

1080
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:16,880
it today but with the internet now

1081
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,880
being quite free and and so free

1082
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:24,560
the you the government can do whatever

1083
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:27,520
he wants but there will always be uh

1084
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,359
spaces and ways

1085
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:32,240
and different means to express ourselves

1086
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,839
with covid of course we do not see a lot

1087
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:35,359
of expression on the street as much as

1088
00:41:35,359 --> 00:41:36,240
we see it before

1089
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,760
but we can see from what malaysia kinney

1090
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,839
is doing and what farming is doing

1091
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:43,040
these efforts will go a long way towards

1092
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:45,760
encouraging uh people and inciting

1093
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:47,839
people towards more expression and

1094
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:51,359
speech i think the future is really to

1095
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,160
start creating or continue to create

1096
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,200
resistance

1097
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,440
writers i think in malaysia there are

1098
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,240
not enough

1099
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,040
resistant writers this was what lawyer

1100
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,599
broke tried

1101
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,119
to do at that time to get around

1102
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,640
 hello edmund are you there

1103
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,839
and we felt that

1104
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,040
when lawyer broke started and to wear

1105
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,920
the different mediums of expression so

1106
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,440
the point i think is

1107
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,599
and what for me is doing is really good

1108
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
because it's inciting a whole new

1109
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,319
generation of

1110
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,359
resistance through arts through writing

1111
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:38,480
and this i think is the future so we as

1112
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:41,359
lawyers csos we can only support we can

1113
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:42,160
only

1114
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:44,240
do what we can in terms of advocacy but

1115
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,520
the frontliners

1116
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,119
are the people like farming that we will

1117
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,920
always uh back we will always defend um

1118
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:52,400
stephen and malaysia because we know

1119
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:53,359
what is right so

1120
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,680
it's not a question of that we will we

1121
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,560
will win

1122
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:58,240
we are actually winning the only

1123
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,319
question uh so i disagree still when i

1124
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:02,160
say we will win one day

1125
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
it's not that we win one day we are

1126
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,920
winning it's just

1127
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:08,800
it just uh depends on how you keep and i

1128
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:09,359
can say

1129
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:11,040
from spending two years inside

1130
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,400
government a lot of

1131
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,400
expression and speech when you stand

1132
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:16,079
inside government

1133
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,720
there is a lot of fear inside government

1134
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:19,680
from what happens

1135
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,240
outside uh and this is something that

1136
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,520
they have to deal with but this is

1137
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:24,960
something that

1138
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:26,880
is also on our shoulders to continuing

1139
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,160
uh to continue the pressure and the

1140
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,560
advocacy thank you nalin

1141
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,720
thanks edmund um watchella

1142
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:38,640
yeah um i would also you know like

1143
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:40,640
steven and edmund you know take a

1144
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,400
positive uh spin

1145
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,960
to what's actually happening now

1146
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:47,040
government's action is actually

1147
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:49,839
leading to or rather encouraging public

1148
00:43:49,839 --> 00:43:50,480
the

1149
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,800
person to occupy more of the spaces

1150
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,800
especially online spaces

1151
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,839
uh to voice their descent right we have

1152
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:58,480
also

1153
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,880
and it's allowing us and giving us the

1154
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,520
space to mobilize more voices

1155
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,839
so from the lay person to the youth we

1156
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,760
are also seeing more resistance

1157
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,240
slowly but yet as uh what uh admins say

1158
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,000
because of the pandemic is small

1159
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:14,079
but there are resistance through

1160
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:15,760
protests as well you know

1161
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,720
both led by foe groups but as well as

1162
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:19,760
huge groups

1163
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,200
so this is really at times um

1164
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,680
of critical times like this we are

1165
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:26,800
seeing more

1166
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:30,400
of um you know people wanting to act

1167
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:33,520
and it's sparkling more conversation and

1168
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:34,000
debate

1169
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,319
despite the attempts by the government

1170
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,599
to silence

1171
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:40,000
us people are acting and i think we are

1172
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,760
really encouraged by that and we will

1173
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,960
continue to

1174
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,680
you know ensure that these voices have

1175
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:46,480
the space

1176
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:49,680
um and the necessary protection to move

1177
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:51,839
forward

1178
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,599
thank you so much uh

1179
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,319
farmy let's hear from our icon

1180
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,160
i think we should stop being afraid of

1181
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,599
the government you know

1182
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,800
um and i think we

1183
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,839
should start exercising our right you

1184
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:13,280
know to freedom of

1185
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:15,839
speech and expression you know clearly

1186
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,400
stated on the article 10 of our

1187
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:22,240
federal constitution uh

1188
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,839
and be prepared to be arrested you know

1189
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:28,160
for for speaking out for expressing

1190
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,040
yourself

1191
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,160

1199
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,760

1200
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,240

preparing themselves to to be arrested

1208
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,319

1209
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:11,040
what and basically people need to know

1210

1211
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:15,119

00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,800
yeah and and if they want to arrest us

1214
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:19,839

from access now but the question i

1251
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:55,119
wanted to ask was something that

1252
00:47:55,119 --> 00:47:56,960
press colleagues in malaysia and calgary

1253
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:58,319
malaysia have asked me

1254
00:47:58,319 --> 00:48:00,240
uh and which was that if you had

1255
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:02,160
literally just and this is particularly

1256
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,800
to

1257
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,400
uh edmund farmi as well as stephen uh

1258
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,640
also if there was one thing that you had

1259
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,680
that you would have malaysian lawmakers

1260
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,280
or judges do not i'm not saying

1261
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,720
government minister but if there's one

1262
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,800
thing you had mps or judges do

1263
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:19,920
in regards to the current press

1264
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:21,839
treatment situation in in malaysia over

1265
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:23,359
the next two to three months

1266
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,800
what would that be i'm just curious on

1267
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,160
what you think some of these

1268
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,520
institutional actors

1269
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:29,839
in parliament and in judiciary could do

1270
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:35,839
in order to make the situation better

1271
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:39,280
anyone want to take up that yeah

1272
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,839
i can answer that i think the demand

1273
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,839
from the lawyer's side was

1274
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,520
when pakitan harappan took over

1275
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,200
government

1276
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:49,119
and this is what they did for some cases

1277
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:51,040
is actually to review

1278
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,319
all the cases that have been

1279
00:48:54,319 --> 00:48:56,960
initiated by the attorney general under

1280
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,480
this repressive laws

1281
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,079
one number two look at the laws

1282
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:04,880
uh of course to repeal or at least to

1283
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,240
amend them

1284
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,480
and i think if the muhidin government

1285
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:14,640
wants to how would you say curry favor

1286
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,160
with certain groups of people then

1287
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,800
this is definitely something which could

1288
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,079
be looked at

1289
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:25,200
in terms of human rights

1290
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,559
i also want to add that

1291
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:32,240
what stephen said about a multi-party

1292
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:33,920
government a weak government after

1293
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,280
elections

1294
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,880
is actually a good thing it's a good

1295
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,880
thing that we have a weak government

1296
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,040
and if we accept that it is a weak

1297
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:42,839
government

1298
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,760
then what has happened

1299
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:48,319
all the many years of different

1300
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,160
democracy movements

1301
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,839
that has led to a weak government is a

1302
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,760
good thing because this is what this is

1303
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:54,559
what we need

1304
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:58,079
we need a weak government and expression

1305
00:49:58,079 --> 00:49:59,359
and speech

1306
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,319
going out to vote is something that may

1307
00:50:02,319 --> 00:50:03,680
have caused this all

1308
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,760
could have caused this so it's a good

1309
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,280
thing that will read government stephen

1310
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,880
i don't understand why

1311
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,480
uh you are saying but i know why you're

1312
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,680
saying that it's because you have a weak

1313
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,200
government then of course

1314
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,520
there will be more persecution but i

1315
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,960
think we should continue to have a weak

1316
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,920
government

1317
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,240
and and all the efforts that civil

1318
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,280
society is doing

1319
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,079
uh should be contributing to having a

1320
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:25,040
weaker government

1321
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:27,839
thank you

1322
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:30,240
thank you and man i might disagree with

1323
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:32,000
that but i i leave it to the panel

1324
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,359
anyone else yes stephen and i just jump

1325
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:35,920
in

1326
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:38,000
i i you know in some ways i do a great

1327
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,160
view i think you know

1328
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:41,920
you you wouldn't want to have a

1329
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:43,280
government that that

1330
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:46,000
is so you know that is it is complete

1331
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:46,880
control of

1332
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:49,040
uh that it doesn't fear about you know

1333
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:50,079
being thrown

1334
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,599
out of power uh you know by

1335
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:55,359
whatever it is and that's the case and

1336
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,200
of course you know there is uh

1337
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,240
uh the chance for them to abuse

1338
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:03,359
uh their power um and uh

1339
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:05,359
and something that we have seen you know

1340
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:08,880
until recently uh

1341
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:11,040
you know having almost complete control

1342
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:11,920
over

1343
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,960
you know everything and uh but i think

1344
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:15,520
you know

1345
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:17,920
my my thinking is in terms of the fact

1346
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
that uh

1347
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:22,400
if you look at harappa and it was

1348
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,720
consider you know something that is

1349
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:26,960
considered an improvement and all that

1350
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:30,079
and they they there is actually an

1351
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:31,440
attempt there to

1352
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:34,400
to bring about some measure of reforms

1353
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,000
perhaps not as far as you know

1354
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,800
some of us may have hope but at least

1355
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,920
you know

1356
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,839
there is talk about reforming you know

1357
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,319
repealing some of the restrictive laws

1358
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:47,359
amending some of the other laws you know

1359
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:51,200
and also for the media side you know

1360
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,359
also in terms of setting up a media

1361
00:51:53,359 --> 00:51:54,559
council so that

1362
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,040
the industry industry itself can

1363
00:51:57,040 --> 00:51:58,800
actually uh you know

1364
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,559
regulate itself uh rather than you know

1365
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,720
the government stepping in all the time

1366
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:06,000
and trying to uh

1367
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:08,240
you know control the media that if

1368
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:10,240
there's any you know any complaints or

1369
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:13,200
any unhappiness about our reporting uh

1370
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:14,880
there is actually a independent

1371
00:52:14,880 --> 00:52:16,800
mechanism there that is you know

1372
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,480
that can actually handle those

1373
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,319
complaints rather than you know

1374
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:21,680
people going to the government and say

1375
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,359
look you know you're supposed to punish

1376
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:25,440
you have to punish these guys for uh for

1377
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:27,200
overstepping whatever unless and they

1378
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:27,680
have

1379
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,680
they've been forced to you know

1380
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,880
implement you know certain laws in order

1381
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:34,559
to control the media so i think

1382
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,440
i think in that sense that uh there was

1383
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,040
there were some attempts there

1384
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,559
uh however of course you know

1385
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,319
unfortunately they didn't last long

1386
00:52:42,319 --> 00:52:43,440
enough to uh

1387
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,599
to bring about you know meaningful

1388
00:52:45,599 --> 00:52:47,760
reforms um

1389
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,359
and that's what i meant really i think

1390
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:51,119
you know we government but hopefully a

1391
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:51,760
weak government

1392
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,880
actually can last uh

1393
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,280
last you know long enough to be able to

1394
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,040
be able for them to implement

1395
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,559
some azure reforms thanks

1396
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,319
thank you stephen uh anyone else have

1397
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:05,599
any any questions or

1398
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,880
uh anything can i answer a little bit

1399
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,119
yes yeah so when when i got arrested

1400
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,280
you know for last month one of the

1401
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,079
police report was actually made by an mp

1402
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:21,280
from the ruling coalition so i think

1403
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:23,280
besides repealing section 233 of the

1404
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,480
communications and multimedia

1405
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:27,839
i think our mps you know should you know

1406
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,400
uh

1407
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,079
have a good sense of humor and stop

1408
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:32,400
treating you know any forms of political

1409
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,240
satiety and parody against them

1410
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,400
as an act of sedition and defamation you

1411
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,400
know stop criminalizing

1412
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:43,520
satire and parody

1413
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,960
i think that two things right if we are

1414
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,800
looking at the judiciary um

1415
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,920
it will be i think it's timely now for

1416
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,680
you know the malaysian judiciary to

1417
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,000
really adopt judicial activism

1418
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,319
you know we we've seen their ups and

1419
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,359
downs with the

1420
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,359
just the decisions that you know even

1421
00:53:59,359 --> 00:54:01,119
the federal courts come up with just the

1422
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:02,160
last few months

1423
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:05,280
right uh we we're actually more inspired

1424
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:07,040
with what's happening in other countries

1425
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,440
just looking at say for example the

1426
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:12,880
madras high court decision which bans

1427
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:16,079
conversion therapy and the the language

1428
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:17,520
is so progressive

1429
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,440
and the statements being made there is

1430
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,800
so progressive

1431
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:23,280
and if that is a way forward for

1432
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,720
malaysia i mean even

1433
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,400
saying things like ignorance is no

1434
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,920
justification for

1435
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,480
normalizing any form of discrimination i

1436
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,400
think it's already a stepping stone

1437
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:35,359
you know for our judiciary that's one

1438
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:35,839
now

1439
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:38,640
to add on to what um stephen said about

1440
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,799
the need for malaysian media council is

1441
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,240
actually very crucial

1442
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:45,599
because they could the state now has

1443
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,799
complete you know powers over regulation

1444
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,160
of media yeah

1445
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:52,480
and we have two sets of laws based on

1446
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,640
distribution mechanisms right we have as

1447
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,440
what uh admins say pppa and we also have

1448
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:58,960
you know uh the communications and

1449
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,720
multimedia so

1450
00:55:00,720 --> 00:55:03,680
having a media council means that it

1451
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,319
will be an

1452
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:07,040
independent self-regulatory mechanism

1453
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:07,760
now

1454
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:10,880
if we can actually get our parliament to

1455
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:11,359
con

1456
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,119
you know the suspension of parliament to

1457
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:14,880
be lifted and they reconvene

1458
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:16,480
one of the things that we really hope

1459
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
that they'll put on the and i say this

1460
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,240
very cautiously as well right we don't

1461
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,000
want this to be used as a tool by the

1462
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:23,040
current government

1463
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,480
but one thing that we hope they will

1464
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,319
prioritize is to

1465
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,119
get the legislation uh moving because

1466
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:31,040
there was already a pro-tem committee

1467
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,599
established last year who's come up with

1468
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:34,720
their report

1469
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:36,640
and they've already also submitted a

1470
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:38,640
draft bill for the media council i think

1471
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,079
that would be a crucial way

1472
00:55:40,079 --> 00:55:43,040
forward to ensure um you know better

1473
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,799
standards for media as well as better

1474
00:55:44,799 --> 00:55:46,960
regulation and more independence in its

1475
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,160
regulation of media

1476
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,720
great thank you so much um is there any

1477
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:55,920
other questions or anything

1478
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,720
we have shared our press releases and

1479
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,240
the join statement

1480
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,400
um and once the youtube video is

1481
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,160
available i'll send it on to all the

1482
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:05,440
media as well

1483
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,079
um that would be perfect for reporting

1484
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:09,520
tomorrow i hope

1485
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:12,400
um if there's no more questions of and

1486
