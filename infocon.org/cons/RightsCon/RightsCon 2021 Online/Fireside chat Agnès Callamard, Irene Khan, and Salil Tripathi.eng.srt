1
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,960
good morning

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:27,439
good afternoon good evening wherever you

3
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,480
are

4
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
one of the great things about writescorn

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
is of course has been that we are able

6
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:33,280
to meet in person

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,640
but we have to pretend that we are

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,800
having a fireside chat now

9
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,960
and unfortunately in a virtual setting

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
but my hope is that

11
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,320
soon we will be living in a universe

12
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,079
where physical contact is possible

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,879
again because social distancing imposes

14
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:48,559
its own restrictions which are not

15
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,440
necessarily

16
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
terrific as we all have come to know

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,760
over the last 16 17 months

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,719
my name is salil tripati i have two i

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,280
chair the writers in prison committee

20
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,280
for penn international which is a global

21
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,280
free expression organization for writers

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,239
and readers

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,240
which believes in freedom to write and

24
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,520
freedom to read

25
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
and i'm also the senior advisor for

26
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,240
global issues at the institute for human

27
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,680
rights and business

28
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,400
which tries to ensure that companies

29
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
live by international standards it's a

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,360
fascinating topic

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,720
and i have two astonishingly brilliant

32
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,479
colleagues to talk with today and i'm

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,080
i'm absolutely thrilled as i'm sure

34
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,799
all of you are uh let me introduce them

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,119
one

36
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
by one first anya scala mad

37
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:35,520
anyas uh has been of course most

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,560
recently the

39
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,920
special reporter for extrajudicial

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,040
executions at the u.n and has done two

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,040
terrific bits of work one is of course

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,320
on the case of

43
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,040
khashoggi which became almost the kind

44
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,320
of lightning rod

45
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,320
for how special reporters deal with

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,680
these issues and how they deal with

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,000
human

48
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
rights abuses but also her persistent

49
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
stubborn in the positive sense of the

50
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,000
term and steadfast defense of human

51
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,119
rights defenders

52
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:04,479
who are facing pressures from

53
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,320
recalcitrant government so we will talk

54
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,680
about that as we go along

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,598
but she has also launched the columbia

56
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,200
free speech initiative at columbia

57
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,959
university where i had a privilege of

58
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,280
working with her a little bit and she

59
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,080
has a

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,879
history with article 19 and with amnesty

61
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,040
international before that

62
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
and my other co-participant today is

63
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:24,959
irene khan

64
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:26,480
who has of course been the secretary

65
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,720
general of amnesty international

66
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,760
exactly the job that anyas has right now

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,200
but we promise we want to be talking

68
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,800
about just one organization we are going

69
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,959
to talk about human rights in general

70
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,800
but irene is a special reporter at the

71
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,319
moment for

72
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,319
freedom of expression and opinion which

73
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,239
of course is an extremely important

74
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,280
right and which is always under siege

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,720
and it has both positive and negative

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,800
outlooks because of what the digital age

77
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
does so i'm absolutely

78
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,319
delighted to have both of you here irene

79
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,958
and anias

80
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,360
i suppose a good way to start and we'll

81
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,360
try to keep this conversational so that

82
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,879
it doesn't sound stilted

83
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,800
talking heads and all that but i think

84
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:09,200
the one of the intriguing things i found

85
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,040
with the theme of the conference this

86
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,760
year which is keep it on

87
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,680
from the internet we all know what

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,200
happens when internet is shut off

89
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,000
governments switch

90
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,720
off networks government require

91
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,480
companies to do so we know the case of

92
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
vodafone in egypt where you know the

93
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,000
cell phone system was

94
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
taken down and there have been other

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,519
attempts to either restrict

96
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,840
parts of the internet or the entire

97
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,680
internet ostensibly on the ground of

98
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,640
security

99
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,400
and safety and yet when you keep it on

100
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,040
there are

101
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,560
other problems one is of course

102
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,640
proliferation of lies what are what's

103
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
called fake news but what we are talking

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,640
about is

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,480
old-fashioned life and yet there is a

106
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,720
dissemination of hate speech

107
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,000
so my first question is about

108
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,440
provocative from a human rights

109
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,640
perspective

110
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,159
is it worth keeping the internet on

111
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,599
and yes oh sorry i was gonna leave

112
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,159
that uh question to um to irene of

113
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,439
course

114
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,000
of course and of course we need uh we

115
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
need the internet on

116
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,519
um it is uh and it has proven to be a

117
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,400
fantastic

118
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,759
formidable tool and engine

119
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
for organization

120
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,720
for communication for

121
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,919
coming together we would not have

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:28,720
managed

123
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,759
to remain an integrated human rights

124
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:32,560
community

125
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,600
over covet without the internet

126
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,600
we would have you know frankly uh

127
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,160
disintegrated

128
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,880
internet has allowed us to to remain

129
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,680
together and to work together

130
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,800
so uh of course we need to keep it on we

131
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:50,560
need to keep it on particularly in

132
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,479
situations where governments

133
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:55,840
want to keep it down um now it does not

134
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,240
mean

135
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,960
that we want to keep it on without any

136
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,800
kind of um

137
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
uh framework and of course the most

138
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,880
important one is human rights framework

139
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,479
we don't want to keep the internet run

140
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,440
being run being driven being controlled

141
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,320
either by

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,919
governments or by multinational

143
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,280
super large super big corporations we

144
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,600
don't want the internet to become

145
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,280
simply a site of money making a site of

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,720
data collection

147
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,400
or a site for cyber conflict

148
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,240
um so you know it is like the rest of

149
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,039
the world

150
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,960
a space for conflict it is not a space

151
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,000
that we can just grab and work with as

152
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,440
we probably had

153
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,360
intended to do 20 25 years ago

154
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,720
it is a place and a space around which

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,759
and for which we human rights activist

156
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:58,319
human rights organization human rights

157
00:05:58,319 --> 00:05:59,280
defenders

158
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,919
would have to fight over and we are

159
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,280
fighting over

160
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,240
that's what i think keep it on means

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:06,639
keep

162
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,840
on the fight it is a space that we need

163
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,199
to fight for

164
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,440
for the soul of which we need to fight

165
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,639
for

166
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,080
i did yes of course i mean uh

167
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,319
we wouldn't be talking here today if the

168
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,759
internet was not on

169
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:24,479
uh and uh if anything covert 19 has

170
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:25,680
shown how important

171
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,560
it is for education for health for work

172
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,800
for connectivity with friends and family

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,240
it's for me i see it as a public good uh

174
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,479
but of course uh like so many

175
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:41,360
uh other uh things in life uh there is a

176
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,039
dark side to it too that needs to be

177
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
managed and anias has pointed that

178
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:48,400
out what i would like to underline

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,000
is keep it on yes but keep it on for

180
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:52,960
everyone

181
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,360
and at the moment there is a very large

182
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,319
part of the world

183
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,759
that has no access to internet in fact

184
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,800
uh internet has uh the use of internet

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,360
and uh the way in which uh it's its

186
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,039
availability is around the world

187
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:08,960
has created new fault lines of

188
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,400
inequality

189
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
where 93 of the world

190
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,599
people are close to mobile broadband

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,120
or internet but only 53 percent

192
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,080
actually have access to those services

193
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,240
and that i think is an unacceptable

194
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,280
situation

195
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,639
because so many human rights application

196
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,319
of human rights today

197
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,479
health education um freedom of speech

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
are both economic and social rights and

199
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,080
civil and political rights are

200
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,120
dependent on access to internet so both

201
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,919
the accessibility the affordability as

202
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,919
well as the safety of internet

203
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:50,639
is absolutely essential for human rights

204
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,319
activists to take into account and to

205
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
fight for

206
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,000
i think that's a fantastic point you

207
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,240
made because too often when we talk

208
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,160
about internet and human rights

209
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,240
the conversation tends to focus on the

210
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
civil and political rights you know

211
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,360
right to expression right to

212
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,080
civil disobedient right for defenders to

213
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,680
come together right for journalists

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,919
and information what is often forgotten

215
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,680
is how internet is becoming so

216
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,800
ubiquitous

217
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,039
in accessing essential services now it

218
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,400
is a very good example

219
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,720
when in country after country we find

220
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,720
that the there is this illusion of

221
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,160
access by saying that

222
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,800
use your smartphone register yourself

223
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,319
and somebody will send you a note when

224
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,840
you can go for vaccination and there are

225
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,440
people who have either no access to

226
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,320
smartphone

227
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,080
or who have no access to the literacy

228
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,000
necessary to be able to use the

229
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,919
smartphone people are elderly people do

230
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,919
not have language ability and all that

231
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,519
and i think that's extremely critical

232
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,760
particularly in the context of the uh

233
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,839
the change campus where students are not

234
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:46,880
in the same class

235
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,560
but speaking in a forum like this i'm

236
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,160
american i'm glad you stressed that

237
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,080
and of course both of you are human

238
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,600
rights experts and you know it

239
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,200
brings in the whole argument of circle

240
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,959
rights and the interdependency of human

241
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,440
rights

242
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,640
and to see rights in isolation is not a

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,600
a very wise thing uh my next question is

244
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,959
about really about

245
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:06,959
talking about what has become now that

246
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,399
you know views of these silos that

247
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,040
people were

248
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,880
human rights defenders people were

249
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,640
journalists people were

250
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,360
states and duty bearers and so on but

251
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,440
internet is changing those equilibriums

252
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,880
in a significant way

253
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,360
what the internet has done is everyone

254
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,080
has become an

255
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,360
activist you know someone who has a

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
smartphone can

257
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,600
portray himself and can build a very

258
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,519
credible following as a journalist or as

259
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,440
a human rights defender and cars are

260
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,120
documenting things you know police are

261
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,839
pairing these

262
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:35,360
cameras on their bodies in some

263
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,040
countries and people are recording

264
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:38,000
police as they are

265
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,640
managing demonstrations and so on so how

266
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,839
can the human rights

267
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,120
movement itself shift uh manage this

268
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,200
shift in the responses that are going on

269
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,120
how can it move away from what used to

270
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,800
be a very inward looking approach in the

271
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,920
past you know which was that

272
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,440
of seeing things in silos because now

273
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,360
pretty much anyone can produce

274
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,839
evidence and again question to both of

275
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,600
you either if you can go first but

276
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,680
and yes maybe because you are running

277
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,279
the largest membership based human

278
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,480
rights organization

279
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,399
in the world you might want to take

280
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:09,360
tackles at first

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,640
i'm not sure i understood your question

282
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,399
saline um

283
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,720
what i'm saying is that internet is

284
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,880
making everyone an activist or a

285
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,399
journalist because you have

286
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,360
tools to get it right now historical

287
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,040
human rights community has been somewhat

288
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,480
of an elite state that you know we are

289
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,160
the researchers we are the ones who

290
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,519
look at things and we are the ones who

291
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:32,000
pronounce the view but that equation is

292
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,440
now changing because of the access that

293
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,200
the technology gives to internet

294
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,279
how are organizations changing to this

295
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,040
challenge and responding to the

296
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,079
challenge

297
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,360
okay um you know i

298
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,040
i don't fully agree with your

299
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,880
assumptions uh

300
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,360
first of all regarding the the history

301
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,279
of the human rights movement i

302
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,640
i think it was a very mixed uh

303
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
mixed bag and there were certainly

304
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,760
people uh

305
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,399
in fact the human rights movement was

306
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:02,800
largely driven by and dependent

307
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,560
upon actors at the local level

308
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:09,600
without necessary access to some of the

309
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,600
means you are describing

310
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,720
uh the human rights movement as you know

311
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,600
the human rights

312
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,480
organization like amnesty international

313
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,800
in the past was certainly

314
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,839
very dependent on the work done at the

315
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,200
national level in

316
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,480
in various locations by

317
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,320
uh by grass foot organization by

318
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,720
uh trade unionist indigenous

319
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,480
activists and so on so i um

320
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:43,680
you know i will strongly question

321
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,079
that the assumption that human rights

322
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,000
was an elitist

323
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,320
movement i i don't see it that way at

324
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,200
least

325
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
uh second in terms of what is happening

326
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:59,839
now yes everybody can potentially become

327
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:03,519
a transmitter they call

328
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,360
a communicator of information

329
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,040
that is related to humanoids protection

330
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,639
human rights solidarity and so on

331
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,000
that however does not make

332
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
human rights evidence it is a potential

333
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
information for human rights purposes

334
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,480
but as you have pointed out in your

335
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,160
initial

336
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,279
question there is a great deal of noise

337
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,480
on internet and through social media

338
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,000
not a lot of it is not does not carry

339
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,360
any meaning or weight from

340
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,079
a human rights standpoint if i take the

341
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,000
example of amnesty international but

342
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,720
this is applicable to a range of other

343
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,360
people and organization nationally and

344
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,880
internationally

345
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:58,320
you need uh you we and others have

346
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,120
developed

347
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,880
very clear expertise so that information

348
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,279
that

349
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,920
appears in the online world so that

350
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
videos so that

351
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,399
audios and and other forms of

352
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,200
information

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,040
is then assessed very thoroughly to

354
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,200
determine whether they have been

355
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,240
doctored with

356
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,639
to determine whether they can

357
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,560
cross-check with the range of other

358
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,680
sources

359
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:27,519
so information noise um

360
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:30,880
voice does not necessarily translate

361
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
into evidence you know it's only

362
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,720
so there is still a role for a range of

363
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,760
actors

364
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,680
at all level and um translating

365
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:45,279
the the richness of what's happening in

366
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,040
uh internet the richness of people being

367
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,079
able to communicate and to send videos

368
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:53,600
and information

369
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,880
moving that into an evidence-based

370
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,399
conclusion and finding uh is a

371
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:05,120
super important step that a lot of

372
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,480
people need to keep

373
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,760
doing thank you uh irene yes

374
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:12,240
yeah uh what i um i agree with anyas

375
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,279
that of course uh

376
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,680
true human rights struggles have always

377
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:16,560
been fought

378
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,639
at the level of communities local

379
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
communities

380
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,760
whether it's you know in the village or

381
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,680
in the region or in the country

382
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,519
that's where human rights change has

383
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,800
come historically

384
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,639
but at the same time i think what the

385
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,519
digital age has done is it has created

386
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:35,120
digital communities

387
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,720
so it's not uh just uh the villagers

388
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,880
but there is a digital village uh that

389
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
has emerged

390
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
like the one that we are discussing now

391
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,199
uh

392
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
whereas in the past uh you would have

393
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,639
for example

394
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,560
amnesty members coming together in

395
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,920
amnesty groups

396
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,800
uh now actually the groups are on the

397
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,240
digital stage

398
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,800
and you can link up across borders

399
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,360
across

400
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:03,199
um uh uh ideologies

401
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,279
in a way in which it was not possible to

402
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:06,639
do in the past

403
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,600
i think in terms of activism that opens

404
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:10,160
up

405
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,959
huge possibilities uh and and we see

406
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,880
that happening with black lives matter

407
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,560
or hashtag me too or

408
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,320
all kinds of social movements that are

409
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,760
coming up there uh

410
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,720
breaking boundaries decentralization

411
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
empowering individuals

412
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,560
to become activists you don't have to

413
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,240
have a card bearing

414
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,759
uh you don't have to be card-bearing

415
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,279
member of a particular human rights

416
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,120
organization to pick up an issue

417
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,079
and and uh express your views on it on

418
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,519
the other hand as anya says the

419
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,399
expertise of human rights of course

420
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,120
therefore becomes more diluted and there

421
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,000
is a risk

422
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,959
of lower standards of human rights

423
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,880
investigation human rights monitoring

424
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:49,920
taking place

425
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,839
but i think at the end of the day it is

426
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,759
the power of the individual and the

427
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:54,160
faith

428
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,639
and belief that we have as individuals

429
00:15:56,639 --> 00:15:58,399
in the power of human rights

430
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:01,279
that's going to make the difference of

431
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,320
course

432
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:05,440
when we have as organizations

433
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,360
engage with governments they need to

434
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,839
have a certain standard and quality

435
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,000
of their work but when individuals go

436
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:12,880
out in the street

437
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,839
and demonstrate they don't need that

438
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:16,880
kind of

439
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,519
expertise that's much more passion so i

440
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,519
think the digital age has made

441
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
passion much more available

442
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:27,120
but at the same time expertise has come

443
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,720
under pressure

444
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,360
so i have a multiple layered question

445
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,079
here so i'll try to break it in part now

446
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:36,560
i mean all three of us uh dearly miss a

447
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:38,800
very close friend who we lost last year

448
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,600
david petracek you know who used to

449
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,040
think

450
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,000
way ahead of others on on philosophical

451
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,360
issues on human rights

452
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,279
and and david used to tell i remember

453
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,440
well that you know in in 20 years ago he

454
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,399
was telling me

455
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,800
that this model is going to break he was

456
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,720
prescient in saying that people based

457
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,240
organizations and we were talking about

458
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,199
local ngos

459
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:00,320
and he was not even thinking about

460
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,000
community base but he had just come back

461
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,040
from philippines and you know

462
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
with people based organization which is

463
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:06,559
a completely different perspective you

464
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,079
know that the passion part is very

465
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:08,959
important

466
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:11,520
but what i'm i have a question about i'm

467
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,119
not saying i'm concerned because

468
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:15,439
standards vary but my question really is

469
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,199
about cultural relativism that might

470
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,679
come in so you might have a particular

471
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:20,880
society

472
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,880
where the middle class believes certain

473
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
rights are extremely important such as

474
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,919
right to speak and write to free

475
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:27,679
assembly right to property

476
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,480
but they may be for the death penalty or

477
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
they may be for very strong anti-terror

478
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,280
violence by

479
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,400
uh anti-terror laws in their own country

480
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,919
and they are the ones who drive the

481
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,679
human rights movement in that country

482
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,760
and there are contradictions so how is

483
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,600
the business model of human rights

484
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:44,480
movement going to

485
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,039
change as we go forward because clearly

486
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,559
the organizations

487
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,000
you showed the divide very well that

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,520
there's passion on the streets and

489
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,200
there's expertise

490
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,000
on the part of the lawyers but how do we

491
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,799
blend this

492
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:59,520
legal commitment on one side and passion

493
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,840
on the other

494
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,600
well it's it's not a new challenge

495
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,679
actually it has happened in the past

496
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,120
i mean i come from bangladesh and

497
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,760
growing up uh i i lived through the war

498
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,039
in bangladesh in this

499
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:21,360
in 71 and uh later on uh violations

500
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,679
before the war after the war during the

501
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:25,120
war and so on

502
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,679
and what was happening on the ground was

503
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:29,039
very very real

504
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,280
um later when i came into europe there

505
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,840
was i didn't find much understanding of

506
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,240
that

507
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:35,919
at that time i'm talking about the 80s

508
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,919
and 90s uh at that time much

509
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,360
understanding of the human rights

510
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,440
struggle that was taking place there

511
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,039
so over time of course uh even within

512
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
the u.n human rights system

513
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
you see with the special rapporteur

514
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,799
mandates for example

515
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,840
my mandate on freedom of expression and

516
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,679
opinion or anya says mandate

517
00:18:55,679 --> 00:18:57,280
these mandates were early mandates that

518
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,039
were created in the 90s

519
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,520
and then now more and more mandates are

520
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,840
developing on economic rights on all

521
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,840
kinds of social rights and so on

522
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
and so the notion of human rights is not

523
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,200
a static one

524
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:12,160
you know as lawyers um and yes and i

525
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,919
both have the legal background as

526
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,799
lawyers we like to see everything neatly

527
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
nicely written down

528
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
but real life is quite messy and the

529
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,400
human rights movement is a messy

530
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:24,240
movement in that sense

531
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
where new ideas and thoughts have come

532
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,559
in people's experience have made it

533
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:31,200
uh very real because after all if human

534
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,160
rights

535
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,640
has no meaning in people's lives then

536
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,160
it's not going to survive

537
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
so yes there will be tensions in

538
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
societies and in certain societies where

539
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,360
there will not be support for the death

540
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:44,080
penalty

541
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,600
in other societies there will be

542
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:47,679
challenge uh to

543
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:49,520
sexual orientation issues or sexual

544
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,799
identity issues

545
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,720
uh women's rights these are all

546
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,480
struggles that have taken place so when

547
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:55,600
we talk about

548
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,960
universality of human rights it's not a

549
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,760
to me it's not a static concept the

550
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,360
universality of human rights is

551
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,840
challenged every day is expanded a

552
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,520
consensus is built in one place

553
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:09,840
consensus is challenged in another place

554
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,520
that's the struggle of the human rights

555
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
movement and so i'm not

556
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,200
actually worried about this i'm pleased

557
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:20,080
as long as people actually are debating

558
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,120
human rights

559
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,600
that gives energy to it i'd worry very

560
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,360
much if human rights was

561
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:29,360
uh caught in a book and put on a shelf

562
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:32,880
right how do you know anias you hinted a

563
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
little bit about

564
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
the way information is being gathered

565
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,960
for human rights and you know your

566
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,400
tenure as a special reporter uh the one

567
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,240
pivotal case in another country that i

568
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,080
want to talk about both of them with you

569
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:47,760
was of course the jamal khashoggi

570
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,600
incident and you investigated it

571
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,120
persistently

572
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,760
you were courageous you were steadfast

573
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,760
you were driven by evidence

574
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,799
and you took it to a frontier that you

575
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:00,720
don't expect special rapporteur it was

576
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:01,360
amazing

577
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,520
the work you did in that now what are

578
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,480
the lessons you learned in that

579
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,600
research methodology and how would

580
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,559
an amnesty researcher now approach and

581
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:13,520
what would be the

582
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,600
what were the strengths you had because

583
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,320
you were operating with the with the un

584
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:21,280
uh with you in a sense and and what were

585
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,799
the weaknesses of that because so often

586
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:23,919
you are dependent on

587
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:25,440
member states being you know willing to

588
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,600
participate in certain instances

589
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,880
and as well as you know what are what

590
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,400
are the what is the autonomy that an

591
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,840
amnesty researcher would have

592
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,919
as he or she goes about in such a

593
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,320
research

594
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,720
um thank you thank you

595
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:44,080
look in terms of the um you know the

596
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,360
the research into the killing of jamal

597
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,080
khashoggi

598
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,440
i think the

599
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,720
the the methodology i followed was not

600
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,559
the typical special reporter methodology

601
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,919
because i focused

602
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,440
on one case and out of one single case

603
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,640
being studied in great depth i sought

604
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:10,000
to extract

605
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,559
recommendations and findings that go

606
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,559
went beyond the case most

607
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,240
of the time special reporter begin with

608
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:21,520
um the principles and work

609
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,559
from within the logic of the law or the

610
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:25,440
logic of

611
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,480
the principle when there are individual

612
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
cases

613
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,080
they are being seen from the standpoint

614
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,520
of the principle

615
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,919
i took the case and i questioned the

616
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,120
principle

617
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,880
so that was a a different uh inductive

618
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,640
form of of of reflection

619
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,919
which um i certainly will recommend i

620
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:50,000
don't think it is applicable to every

621
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,200
situation

622
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,840
but in my particular case by

623
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,960
investigating the killing of jamal

624
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:58,080
khashoggi i was

625
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,360
able to understand the very broad

626
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,880
limitation of the international systems

627
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,880
in terms of what it can do for single

628
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,120
case which is very little

629
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:11,600
um i'll stop here to just say that um

630
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,039
you know it was a

631
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,180
form of methodology that

632
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,120
[Music]

633
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,760
you know differed from the the

634
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,400
traditional approach

635
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,400
particularly the human rights approach

636
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,799
which begins with the principle and then

637
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:27,760
apply

638
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,559
the law or the principle to a case i

639
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,640
began with the case i looked at the case

640
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,400
of course i referred to the principle

641
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,679
but i used

642
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,240
the learning from the case to question

643
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,240
the legal framework to question

644
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,600
public policies and to question um

645
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:48,080
a range of implications

646
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,880
right uh irene uh your reaction to that

647
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,400
i mean is that the kind of approach you

648
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,480
think is possible in the case of

649
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:55,440
because you know when you're talking

650
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
about ejes you're specifically talking

651
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,640
about individuals

652
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,640
right to information and opinion does

653
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,080
involve individuals but also there's a

654
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,919
broader principle behind it

655
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,320
well actually uh that was an individual

656
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,600
um but it

657
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,919
he was a journalist so in a way there is

658
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,200
a cross

659
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,880
over uh from anya's mandate to mine and

660
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,960
journalists as you know unfortunately

661
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,559
journalism is a dangerous profession

662
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,279
today

663
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,640
and many of um of the killings

664
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,039
of this kind happen to be of journalists

665
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,960
um i think what anias is saying is a

666
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:28,640
very interesting approach

667
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,919
um she's talking about a very

668
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,679
interesting approach particularly when

669
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,080
you want to expose the gaps

670
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,760
and weaknesses of the international

671
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:41,279
human rights law system and it goes back

672
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,679
to our earlier discussion about

673
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,480
how important the reality is in the

674
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,760
human rights world

675
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:50,240
and that we not live with principles and

676
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,679
values and

677
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:55,360
create an ideal world which is great

678
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,440
for for debate and analysis and so on

679
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,559
but doesn't make a difference in

680
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,600
people's lives

681
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,360
so what anyas was doing taking a real

682
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,360
case to show that the international

683
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,880
system is not equipped

684
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,640
to deal with this kind of killing even

685
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,240
though it is a blatant

686
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,360
uh violation the crudest most cruelest

687
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,159
form

688
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,480
of violation that can take place but the

689
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,360
international

690
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,440
system was is not equipped to deal with

691
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,360
it and so what do you need to do with it

692
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,679
and

693
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,840
how can you strengthen the situation and

694
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:22,799
so on so

695
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,960
and there are many many areas where we

696
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,240
are actually finding

697
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
that the principles are fine but the

698
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,240
application is in trouble

699
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,440
and that's why we and i think the u.n

700
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,559
human rights system has created quite a

701
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,080
unique

702
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,799
mechanism that governments have actually

703
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:41,279
given

704
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,400
power to individuals independent

705
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,520
with full independence to speak out

706
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,000
in the name of the un and that is quite

707
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,799
remarkable

708
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,200
in a membership based organization to

709
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,039
create the special rapporteur system and

710
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:56,799
what i just want to mention here

711
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,760
is that civil society actually is our

712
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:00,320
biggest

713
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,720
champion and the need to continue to

714
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,000
champion us

715
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,080
because obviously we threaten

716
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,080
governments we criticize governments and

717
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,520
anyas herself has done so with some cost

718
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,400
uh to her own safety security and peace

719
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,120
of mind

720
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,400
um so civil we need

721
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,960
civil society to keep backing uh the

722
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,279
special rapporteurs and to make sure

723
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:26,640
that we don't get eroded by the politics

724
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,279
of the u.n

725
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,200
yeah but but there's the other threat

726
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:33,039
that special reporters have always had

727
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:34,320
which is you know the threat from

728
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,240
states which either don't let them in to

729
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,080
start with i mean there are countries

730
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,919
which you know hold regular elections i

731
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,279
mean whether they're democratic in the

732
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:42,480
different question

733
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,400
uh who it's it's impossible for the

734
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,159
reporter to go to those countries even

735
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:46,960
for

736
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,720
relatively less political rights

737
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,240
obviously relatively because every right

738
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,679
has a political element so i don't want

739
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:52,480
to say that

740
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,000
some rights are political and some are

741
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,440
not but even the right to health has

742
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,120
political implications so

743
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,960
i certainly don't want to make less of

744
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,720
that but again i want to start with

745
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,559
you on yes and then come back to irene

746
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,080
on the next question

747
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,880
which is a kind of almost bituperative

748
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,919
hatred

749
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:10,240
you attracted from some governments anya

750
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,400
because of your

751
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,679
exceptionally courageous and strong

752
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
stance on extra

753
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,640
judicial execution then i have in mind

754
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,159
philippines here you know because

755
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:19,919
every time you said something about

756
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,600
philippines the president used

757
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,520
unparliamentary language and responding

758
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,320
to you

759
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
they were misogynistic they were

760
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,840
targeting you because you were a woman

761
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,440
and then of course there were lots more

762
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,600
and each time i would retweet something

763
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,640
you had said

764
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:34,399
i would also get abused in tagalog which

765
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:35,679
i didn't understand but that that

766
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,640
happened to me and

767
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
it happened to me in turkish as well so

768
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,799
i mean uh when i speak about mr ardogan

769
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:42,559
and his government so i'm i'm used to it

770
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:43,200
in a way

771
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,480
but the question therefore is that how i

772
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,880
mean

773
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
what do we do about cleaning up this

774
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,720
space so that it becomes more civil

775
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,399
is it possible i mean you obviously

776
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,320
didn't care and you know you you

777
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,720
said exactly what you needed to everyone

778
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,960
is not able to do that so how can we

779
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,399
is it possible to make the internet a

780
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:03,600
more receptive space or is that just a

781
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,158
pipe dream

782
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,840
how you know i mean there are different

783
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,720
layers to

784
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,320
to your question saline um

785
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,320
one uh one is about the individual

786
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,480
uh themselves and uh how prepared

787
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:26,720
and willing they are to um to stand up

788
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,080
uh and that is very much driven by their

789
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:33,200
personal um you know

790
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
environment i think and where they are

791
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
located

792
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,840
i was uh frankly quite safe

793
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,320
i you know i worked as a special

794
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,679
reporter i was

795
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,279
mostly based in countries which i think

796
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,760
would not have gone out of their way to

797
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:52,799
hurt me

798
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,240
or to harm me and in fact possibly they

799
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:56,720
would

800
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,159
go out of their way to protect me um

801
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:04,000
so compared to individuals currently

802
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,240
in egypt or in turkey or in the

803
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,279
philippines

804
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,840
through the red tagging in particular

805
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,799
you know my

806
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:14,480
my position was i was was really a very

807
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:16,640
privileged one and in many ways it was

808
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,880
easy for me to speak the way

809
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:22,240
i would so that's the first thing

810
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:25,440
that being said how much

811
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:28,559
um support you get when you speak up i

812
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,279
think is

813
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:33,120
extremely important who is prepared to

814
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,039
stand by your side uh who is prepared to

815
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:40,960
have your back um who is prepared to go

816
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,080
out of their way to communicate

817
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,120
their support that matters a great deal

818
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,399
it mattered to me

819
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,799
and i'm sure it matters even more for

820
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:52,559
people who are on the front line

821
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,320
of harm and um and violence

822
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:00,640
i got a lot of that not from institution

823
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,760
but from other individuals um and

824
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:07,120
from you know a variety of actors

825
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:11,279
and that gives you the strength and the

826
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,080
um you know the environment that you

827
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:14,720
need

828
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,840
in order to keep uh speaking up and uh

829
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,480
speaking truth to power so i would like

830
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,559
to invite whoever is

831
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:25,919
listening always stand up for those who

832
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:26,880
are making

833
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,120
taking the risk you know even if you

834
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,320
don't know them just

835
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,799
write to them use twitter use social

836
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:33,600
media

837
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,200
express your um your support

838
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,240
to whoever is courageous whoever is

839
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,360
taking a stand because they will get so

840
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,080
much

841
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,760
from those marks um marks of support

842
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,320
um but then you also ask questions about

843
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,520
whether the

844
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:54,480
the internet can be made more more civil

845
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,159
and here we're looking more at

846
00:30:56,159 --> 00:30:59,760
um regulations and and content

847
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,960
moderation it's a very different uh

848
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,480
uh questions my my one of my

849
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,679
um realization when i got uh

850
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,279
attacked or criticized or you know

851
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:15,600
you know the object of organized

852
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,640
campaign

853
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:20,480
is in fact that the problem may not be

854
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,159
one individual statement the problem is

855
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,600
rather the way people are organized

856
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,320
online to um you to work as a mob

857
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:35,519
against uh individuals so it is

858
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,279
rather the the use of the digital space

859
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,799
for mobbing uh people a little bit like

860
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,480
you know you're suddenly

861
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,519
in the street and hundreds of people go

862
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:49,440
after you to lynch you

863
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,880
that to me is one of the dimension of

864
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,360
the digital space which does not receive

865
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:57,039
sufficient attention

866
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,880
because you're gonna focus on the

867
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,320
content maybe

868
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:04,720
on one individual but the capacity of

869
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,799
the internet providers of other actors

870
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:12,960
to control that form of

871
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,320
activism for the sake of uh you know uh

872
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:20,080
or misuse of uh trolls creation of

873
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,080
choice to create that

874
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,360
impression of collective uh

875
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:29,120
dimension and a mob going after you

876
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:32,240
i think we don't have sufficient tools i

877
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:32,880
remember

878
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,799
at the time when i was mobbed by

879
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,080
thousands of philippine individual

880
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,720
soldiers fake accounts i reached out to

881
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,679
twitter

882
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:45,919
and they pointed out to me that and they

883
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,360
were right that the

884
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,960
initial uh statement from one

885
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,440
very well organized person did not

886
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,760
violate their community standards

887
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,200
which was fine however when then

888
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,159
thousands if not more i've been talking

889
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,559
thousands and thousands of people

890
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,440
then grab that statement and mob you

891
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,720
with it

892
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:11,600
that to me was what twitter was not

893
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,120
prepared to tackle

894
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,919
and when the person that did not break

895
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:16,880
the rule

896
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:20,000
has access to those mobs

897
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:23,440
to those trolls to those fake accounts

898
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
that i think is what they need to be far

899
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,640
more

900
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:29,360
uh prepared towards i think they are

901
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,960
getting better by the way but

902
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,600
at the time they could not help me and i

903
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,080
spent

904
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,360
hours and hours and hours just blocking

905
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,720
or muting

906
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,679
you know thousands thousands of people

907
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:42,720
thank you

908
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,159
you know and i think the point you make

909
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
it there is a an element of

910
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,399
complacency that creeps in among others

911
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:49,440
that you know this is

912
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,240
offline with no online implications and

913
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,159
irene i wanted to come to you on that

914
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,240
because you so very well know

915
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,600
cases of daphne karuna galicia in uh in

916
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,519
malta or gauri lankesh in

917
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:04,480
india and some about a few years earlier

918
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,760
anna politkovskaya

919
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,639
in russian federation where these very

920
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,839
brave

921
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,239
women journalists had received online

922
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,280
threats

923
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,119
and you know people are it's only online

924
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,079
and then all of them were murdered

925
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,079
later on i'm not trying to suggest that

926
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,520
the people who murdered were those who

927
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,040
were making the threats but it created

928
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,320
an atmosphere

929
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,159
in which it was possible and it's it's

930
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,440
not a coincidence

931
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,280
that all the examples we are citing are

932
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,040
women here right so there is a

933
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,520
misogynistic gender based element to it

934
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,679
um i'm just wondering what your thoughts

935
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,719
are on that and how

936
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:39,119
how do we grapple with it i'm writing a

937
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,639
paper as we speak

938
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:42,560
as i was telling you a few days ago

939
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,639
exactly on the threats to women online

940
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,560
and it pervades even beyond that

941
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:49,280
with deep fake and humiliation i know

942
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,359
several human rights defenders and

943
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,719
writers who have gone

944
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:54,560
off internet or at least off social

945
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,800
media because they don't want that

946
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,160
exposure because they're far more

947
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,160
important things to do

948
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,359
now you're absolutely right there's a

949
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:02,800
very close connection between the

950
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,320
offline and the online

951
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,720
sometimes in in the offline in the real

952
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,359
world

953
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:10,160
uh a political leader will say something

954
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
and we have seen how that has been

955
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:12,800
picked up

956
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,240
uh online spread amplified uh

957
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,000
and and used then to create

958
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,240
more offline violence so the

959
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,640
relationship between online and offline

960
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:27,920
is is very close and complex one and

961
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,920
i actually might one of my first

962
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,280
meetings with

963
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:34,640
um uh i think it was with twitter

964
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:35,599
actually uh

965
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,760
by coincidence anias where i asked them

966
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
what lessons they had drawn

967
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,640
from the past uh year the covet 19 year

968
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,599
and they said

969
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:46,720
that they had begun to realize how

970
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,760
what happens online what kind of impact

971
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:50,880
it has offline

972
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,640
so even for the social media platforms

973
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,160
that was awakening

974
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,320
that these are not two different things

975
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,240
after all both online and offline the

976
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
manipulation is actually

977
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,520
at some point done by a human being

978
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,359
or human beings i think we need to keep

979
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:06,560
that in mind it's not this

980
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,320
technology is just taking taking over

981
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
and working automatically

982
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,760
uh and that realization i think uh

983
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:16,880
it comes to women but it also uh

984
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:20,160
certain minority groups uh and others

985
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,560
vulnerable people at risk uh and

986
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,079
particularly for women because

987
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:27,200
you know we go back to the old uh gender

988
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,160
power struggle

989
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:30,240
that happens in real life that is still

990
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:31,760
happening as women becoming more

991
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:32,960
prominent and women

992
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,200
are uh seeking demanding equality and

993
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,560
justice the same

994
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,640
those same dynamics are transferring of

995
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,000
course online

996
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
and making it very hard for women and

997
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,520
especially

998
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,240
women in public life online uh to carry

999
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,520
out their work

1000
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:49,280
but there are clear things that we have

1001
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,760
learned on how to deal with hate speech

1002
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,599
there has been a lot of work done that

1003
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,599
and anias was also involved of course

1004
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:58,160
in the rabbah plan of action in creating

1005
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,000
guidelines and criteria

1006
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,000
of how to manage hate speech because

1007
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,480
freedom of expression is not an absolute

1008
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,839
right freedom of expression can be

1009
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:08,000
restricted

1010
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,079
but under certain conditions in

1011
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:11,599
international law

1012
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:14,480
lawful necessary proportionate and on

1013
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,079
legitimate grounds

1014
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,680
it can be prohibited when it's an

1015
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,000
incitement to violence

1016
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,040
those measures should be used

1017
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,720
in an appropriate manner and i am

1018
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,400
emphasized appropriate because very

1019
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,000
often what happens is

1020
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,800
uh the excuse of controlling hate speech

1021
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:31,599
becomes

1022
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:33,920
a cover for carrying out censorship so

1023
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,760
we must be very careful about where we

1024
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,079
draw

1025
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:38,000
lines and there must be greater

1026
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,480
realization on the part of companies of

1027
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,960
the responsibility that they have

1028
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,359
they are an intermediary true but they

1029
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:46,000
are a very

1030
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,440
powerful intermediary of words and uh

1031
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,160
language and message and communications

1032
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,480
and they have some responsibility there

1033
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,359
unfortunately the business model of the

1034
00:37:57,359 --> 00:37:58,320
companies

1035
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,119
are not usually um don't don't get

1036
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,320
enough attention

1037
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,320
there is attention given content

1038
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,520
moderation

1039
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,839
but not to the business model where they

1040
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,680
have an interest very often

1041
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,880
in keeping people attracted in using

1042
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,000
uh uh various mechanisms uh

1043
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:20,240
to uh to uh which actually then lead

1044
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,720
um to disinformation misinformation and

1045
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,680
hate speech

1046
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:26,320
so there needs to be much stronger

1047
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,160
realization on their side that their

1048
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:30,000
products that they are creating

1049
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,400
should undergo due diligence human

1050
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,320
rights due diligence and human rights

1051
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,320
impact assessment and they need to be

1052
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:38,480
much more transparent about their rules

1053
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:42,480
and they need to create for example

1054
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,400
the mobbing that you were talking about

1055
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:45,680
anyask uh

1056
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:48,960
it's very easy through uh um

1057
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,720
even through algorithms and automated

1058
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,880
means to see

1059
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,040
in that traffic where their traffic is

1060
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,000
being driven

1061
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,680
and then to see why the traffic is being

1062
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,359
driven there the traffic might be driven

1063
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,160
there

1064
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,960
for very good reasons but it can also be

1065
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,599
driven

1066
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:05,760
there for wrong reasons and they need to

1067
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:06,720
look into those

1068
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,119
issues much more carefully and they can

1069
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,040
do that if they were to engage with the

1070
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,040
people whose rights are being affected

1071
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:16,079
i think it's much more necessary uh for

1072
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:17,760
the digital companies and digital

1073
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,400
platforms to begin to talk with people

1074
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,760
whose rights are being affected uh

1075
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,400
and that's where the multi-stakeholder

1076
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,079
approach

1077
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:31,200
is such a useful one to think about when

1078
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,040
we talk about the digital world

1079
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,119
because you know in the real world you

1080
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:36,960
have states and you have companies

1081
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,960
and then you have civil society making a

1082
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:41,119
noise around but when you go to the

1083
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:42,720
online world

1084
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,720
that's when there is need for close

1085
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,280
partnership between the various entities

1086
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:49,599
to figure out how to deal with these

1087
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,480
dark forces that are moving there

1088
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:54,800
yeah you you use the word hate speech

1089
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,400
and i just wanted to make a very small

1090
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,240
interjection there and then move on to

1091
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,920
precisely the theme you spoke about

1092
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,599
irene which is disinformation i'm just

1093
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:02,960
coming to that because you've written a

1094
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:04,000
report on it

1095
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,920
and and hate speech you know the lack of

1096
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,839
clarity and anes you also dealt with him

1097
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:08,720
during your

1098
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
article 19 days about you know what hate

1099
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,079
speech means and

1100
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:14,000
it has basically come to mean the speech

1101
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,160
you hate is a hate speech

1102
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,720
and it ends up undermining the whole

1103
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,319
notion of freedom of expression and i

1104
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:21,119
think there is

1105
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,960
need for greater clarity and anes also

1106
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,720
wanted to thank you for pointing out the

1107
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:26,640
need to express solidarity

1108
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,400
with the people who show courage because

1109
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,920
you know through pen we work with

1110
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,359
writers who are in prison

1111
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:32,960
amnesty of course you know has this

1112
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:35,359
prisoner of conscience

1113
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:39,280
iconic idea that amnesty came up with uh

1114
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,240
at its founding uh and we hear

1115
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,000
repeatedly from writers who have

1116
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,359
subsequently been

1117
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,240
released from prison how important it

1118
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,160
was for them to receive that support so

1119
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:50,960
i can't

1120
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
stress that enough i can't endorse that

1121
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,560
you know we have them coming and meeting

1122
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:56,400
us later at our pen meetings and they

1123
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
say that you know what mattered the most

1124
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,359
what made us feel

1125
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:01,200
that it was worth going on this

1126
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,640
suffering was worth it

1127
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,480
was his letters and this message that

1128
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:05,839
came our way

1129
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,760
emo mayo messi the famous writer in

1130
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,200
africa from cameroon

1131
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,440
i remember him telling us once that he

1132
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,560
was uh

1133
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:14,240
his jailer said that you know why are

1134
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,760
you getting all these letters are you

1135
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
some kind of vip

1136
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,040
and he said yes i'm a very important

1137
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,200
prisoner that was his reply at that time

1138
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,200
so there you go so thank you for making

1139
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,800
that one but i didn't speaking about

1140
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,119
this

1141
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:28,000
information and and the report you did

1142
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,599
who should decide what's said

1143
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:32,160
and not what's not said on the internet

1144
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,760
there was a time when we felt that we

1145
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,079
could

1146
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:36,079
trust government because companies were

1147
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,920
monopolies you know facebook is you know

1148
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:40,319
has more members than any country in the

1149
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,480
more users and and the population of any

1150
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,839
country in the world and you know they

1151
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:44,400
have huge

1152
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,520
uh revenue models and so on but then at

1153
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,000
the same

1154
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:49,520
time we have situations of certain

1155
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:50,880
countries and i you know and yes you

1156
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,240
just released your report today on

1157
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,359
xinjiang

1158
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:55,280
in in china i think i was listening to

1159
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,880
it on the radio this morning

1160
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:58,960
um you have countries i mean situations

1161
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,359
like myanmar like kashmir like xinjiang

1162
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,440
and now nigeria taking on twitter where

1163
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,520
the state is asserting its power

1164
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,400
and curbing the rules of the social

1165
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,440
media to speak

1166
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:11,520
or sensibility on the on this ground of

1167
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:14,160
uh of you know curbing disinformation

1168
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,119
so how do we navigate that space you

1169
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:18,880
learned as you wrote your report

1170
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:21,280
and where can we rely on the company and

1171
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,319
where can we rely

1172
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:24,720
on the state in this multi-stakeholder

1173
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,040
model

1174
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:32,560
um that's addressed to me yes because

1175
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:37,599
i mean tell us about your disinformation

1176
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:41,280
well you know um when it comes to

1177
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,640
freedom of expression

1178
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,760
both the state and the company have

1179
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:46,880
vested interests

1180
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,359
the state forest political interest and

1181
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:51,280
the company for commercial interests

1182
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,240
and that's why i think it's important um

1183
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,160
to look at the international law firm

1184
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,200
the human rights

1185
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:59,359
framework to look at international human

1186
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:00,640
rights law which

1187
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,280
which is very clear who decides the

1188
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:04,480
rights holder

1189
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,880
it's an empowering right and therefore

1190
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,960
it's not a right that can be easily

1191
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:12,319
restricted by either state or or company

1192
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:13,359
on the contrary

1193
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:16,400
the state has the responsibility to

1194
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,280
respect

1195
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,280
uh human rights but also to protect

1196
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,760
human rights and that means protected

1197
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:24,880
from abuse or or

1198
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:27,920
attack uh by non-state actors including

1199
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,200
companies private private sector um and

1200
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,040
governments uh need to therefore

1201
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:38,839
apply uh human rights rules to their own

1202
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:41,839
policies they and they should not

1203
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,800
actually use companies to censor a

1204
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:45,280
speech

1205
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:47,440
in many parts of the world governments

1206
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,520
are now not censoring themselves

1207
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:52,319
but putting restrictions on social media

1208
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:52,880
and

1209
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,960
therefore getting social media to do

1210
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,800
something that if they're not subject

1211
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:00,160
to any judicial scrutiny any um

1212
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,079
means of remedies for for the

1213
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,760
individuals and that is of course

1214
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:06,720
totally wrong companies on the other

1215
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:07,520
hand

1216
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,760
also have to make sure that their own

1217
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:10,960
community standards

1218
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,040
are in line with human rights their

1219
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,160
products as we were

1220
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,680
talking earlier the services they

1221
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:18,000
provide do not lead to violation of

1222
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,040
human rights

1223
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,200
and that they are transparent one of the

1224
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,480
biggest problems

1225
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:24,640
with the digital platforms of course is

1226
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:25,599
that we don't

1227
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,200
know what's happening there um and

1228
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,880
that is is without transparency you

1229
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,800
cannot have accountability

1230
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,839
uh and that is where i think

1231
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,839
governments the state should not

1232
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,960
regulate

1233
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:44,640
uh the content uh on online

1234
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,359
unless it is in extreme cases uh as we

1235
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:49,839
talked about incitement to violence

1236
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:53,280
and hatred and those types of extreme

1237
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:54,000
cases

1238
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,960
but what the state should be doing is

1239
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,280
regulating social media

1240
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,480
on transparency on accountability

1241
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:06,079
on due process and i think

1242
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:09,599
that the way forward really is much more

1243
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,079
um approach of social media councils

1244
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:16,760
for example where there is a

1245
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:19,040
multi-stakeholder approach

1246
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,560
with users with companies

1247
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,200
and with governments talking together to

1248
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:27,040
see what's the best way

1249
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:30,960
of regulating online speech

1250
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,200
you know under international law false

1251
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,480
speech

1252
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,400
anything that is false is not

1253
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:37,520
necessarily

1254
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:40,960
uh prohibited what is restricted what

1255
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,640
can be restricted or prohibited

1256
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,920
is the harm that emerges from false or

1257
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,359
manipulated speech

1258
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,680
so the focus should be there but that

1259
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:51,359
focus has to be a very narrow

1260
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:54,319
narrow one because very often uh the

1261
00:45:54,319 --> 00:45:56,400
line between what is misinformation and

1262
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,160
disinformation and what is actually

1263
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:00,720
censorship uh is a very fine one and

1264
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,079
more and more governments are now

1265
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:04,000
introducing laws in fact

1266
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:07,200
20 states during the covet uh 19 period

1267
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,319
20 states introduced legislation on fake

1268
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:11,119
news

1269
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:14,160
and very often those laws were so vague

1270
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:18,160
um that of course a lot of

1271
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:21,440
permissible speech was restricted uh

1272
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,240
companies are being uh companies when we

1273
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:24,800
look at

1274
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,119
how companies are behaving uh they have

1275
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:28,079
introduced

1276
00:46:28,079 --> 00:46:30,560
various measures uh to improve content

1277
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,400
moderation in particular in relation to

1278
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,079
misinformation and disinformation

1279
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:35,440
but they haven't really looked at their

1280
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:37,200
own business models that

1281
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:39,359
lead to the creation of disinformation

1282
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,079
they haven't really

1283
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:44,160
committed they commit themselves to

1284
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,119
transparency but

1285
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:47,359
they haven't really been transparent

1286
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:49,440
especially when it comes to algorithms

1287
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,920
uh when it comes to recommender systems

1288
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:52,640
and so on

1289
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:55,760
uh there is a lack of transparency there

1290
00:46:55,760 --> 00:46:56,720
and

1291
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,920
what we also see is different

1292
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,480
the disparity the disparity in their

1293
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:03,599
practice across

1294
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:06,640
different geographies the largest social

1295
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:08,000
media platforms

1296
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,119
are of course very acutely sensitive

1297
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:13,440
to their largest markets which happen to

1298
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,560
be in

1299
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,960
the western countries um in the global

1300
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,680
north

1301
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:20,880
and we find very different treatments uh

1302
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,160
by these companies

1303
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:24,720
uh in the global south and the users of

1304
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:26,640
course are treated very differently

1305
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,680
um so that's that's a big danger so i

1306
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,640
think there's a lot

1307
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:34,400
that can be done here to bring a better

1308
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,520
practice but we will learn when we work

1309
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:38,400
together

1310
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,599
and i think the un system

1311
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:44,800
uh the governments the major

1312
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:46,400
major governments that are looking in

1313
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,720
this area for example the european union

1314
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,559
and the large companies all have a huge

1315
00:47:51,559 --> 00:47:52,880
responsibility

1316
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,480
to come across down at the table

1317
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,359
with civil society academics and

1318
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:00,160
scholars

1319
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,280
and representatives of users to try to

1320
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,480
figure out

1321
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:07,520
effective multi-stakeholder uh systems

1322
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,920
for dialogue and to find solutions

1323
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,119
uh we have 11 12 minutes and anya so

1324
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:14,160
very quickly to you

1325
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:15,520
we have three questions i want to come

1326
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:16,960
to the question it's a very quick

1327
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:17,839
question to you

1328
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,079
can we trust companies to be honest

1329
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:21,680
brokers in this

1330
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:24,240
as as you know content moderation and so

1331
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,440
on because irene has shown up the

1332
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:26,319
challenges

1333
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:28,640
do you think uh from an amnesty

1334
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:30,240
perspective you think you can trust

1335
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,720
companies

1336
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:36,160
look i think um i would not approach the

1337
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,839
issue from that standpoint

1338
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:41,200
uh selling first um i

1339
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:45,440
have from um a broader global

1340
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:47,839
perspective if not historical i will say

1341
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:49,599
that right now the system is

1342
00:48:49,599 --> 00:48:52,640
extremely unstable it's unstable because

1343
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,720
the technology is evolving

1344
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,599
it's unstable because the actors are

1345
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,720
changing

1346
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,559
um and to try to create

1347
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,760
um a regulatory

1348
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:08,559
framework upon something that is

1349
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,319
constantly changing

1350
00:49:10,319 --> 00:49:13,680
is very difficult if not impossible

1351
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,800
second therefore we need

1352
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:20,480
to understand that in my view we are

1353
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:23,839
in a period of testing out governments

1354
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:24,880
are testing out

1355
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,680
companies are testing out users should

1356
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,440
also be testing out

1357
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,440
we are very far from having a solidified

1358
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:36,800
stable system to manage

1359
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,359
this new space called the digital space

1360
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,920
which as you pointed out earlier is

1361
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:45,359
every everything space you know so we

1362
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:47,200
are testing out and

1363
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,319
i like i want to look at those uh

1364
00:49:50,319 --> 00:49:53,040
different approaches from that

1365
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,079
standpoint

1366
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,280
the governments and us need to to

1367
00:49:57,280 --> 00:50:01,680
test out i believe personally that

1368
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,880
in the current uh environment

1369
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:08,079
international law is a good uh

1370
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:11,280
driver but it is a driver that needs

1371
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,839
to be challenged so that he can

1372
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:14,960
accommodate

1373
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,680
the existence of actors other than the

1374
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,720
states

1375
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,000
i would like to think that

1376
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,200
corporate actors can self-regulate in an

1377
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,400
effective way for the purpose of

1378
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:31,440
the protection of the global public good

1379
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,119
but i don't know whether they will reach

1380
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,599
that stage without

1381
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,359
being considered as duty bearers under

1382
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:40,160
international

1383
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,240
law including international human rights

1384
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,760
law at the moment they're not

1385
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:47,599
i think it's a it's a problem um

1386
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:50,240
personally in all my writing on the

1387
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,319
regulation of internet i have

1388
00:50:52,319 --> 00:50:56,079
increasingly moved towards recommending

1389
00:50:56,079 --> 00:50:58,880
that we consider the corporate actives

1390
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,319
in the digital space

1391
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,680
as uh legally bound by international law

1392
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,520
and that if international is not there

1393
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,800
yet we need to reform

1394
00:51:06,800 --> 00:51:09,839
international law so that's uh

1395
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:12,079
where i'm going it does not mean that

1396
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,359
there is no

1397
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:15,839
role for government of course there are

1398
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:18,160
i think arenas highlighted some of them

1399
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:20,400
which is really focusing on

1400
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,040
the working of the commerce commercial

1401
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,720
sector the anti-trust

1402
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,839
regulations the the control of the

1403
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,599
market the control over the

1404
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,640
the signs and so on and so forth so

1405
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:35,520
i will you know i i do believe that we

1406
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,640
really need

1407
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:40,160
to try out different approaches i think

1408
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:44,160
the facebook or the site board is a way

1409
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,760
for those companies to explore their

1410
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:48,319
responsibilities

1411
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:51,680
unlike many i think a number of people i

1412
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:52,000
am

1413
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:53,880
very interested in the kind of

1414
00:51:53,880 --> 00:51:55,200
jurisprudence

1415
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,359
that this other side board is gonna

1416
00:51:57,359 --> 00:51:58,800
establish because it

1417
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,920
is our real first attempt to have a

1418
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,839
global jurisprudence

1419
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:07,040
over global content not perfect but like

1420
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,880
i said we're in a period where we need

1421
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,599
to test

1422
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,559
out various things some will survive

1423
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,240
some will not

1424
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,400
great we have eight minutes we have

1425
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,280
three questions

1426
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:19,359
if you can keep your responses brief the

1427
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,480
first question is from

1428
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,319
chip and it is i think better for id

1429
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:27,040
is there any norm or mechanism in the

1430
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:28,000
u.n

1431
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,079
regarding preventing global digital

1432
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,000
platforms from systematically

1433
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,960
violating users digital rights and

1434
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,480
freedom of expression do we have any

1435
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:39,440
human mechanisms

1436
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:43,359
um no for the same reasons not not a u.n

1437
00:52:43,359 --> 00:52:44,960
mechanism but for the same reason that

1438
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,359
anya's just explained that companies are

1439
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,119
not directly responsible

1440
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:50,800
for human rights under international law

1441
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:52,960
so the u.n cannot reach out to them

1442
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:55,680
there are voluntary mechanisms uh that

1443
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,280
have been developed for example the

1444
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,480
global compact

1445
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:01,920
there are other uh means um that

1446
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,839
exists of multi-stakeholder um or

1447
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:07,119
entities that are coming up where

1448
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:09,200
companies are also working but these are

1449
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,720
all voluntary means

1450
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,640
at the end of the day you hold companies

1451
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:14,079
responsible under national

1452
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:17,119
law and i think the states when you look

1453
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:18,800
at the monopoly of the companies

1454
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,160
where they're located uh and the

1455
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:23,760
kinds of countries where they're located

1456
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,440
in then i think some countries have a

1457
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,359
bigger responsibility here to wake up

1458
00:53:27,359 --> 00:53:29,520
and do something about it we see some

1459
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,040
interesting developments in the context

1460
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,480
of the european union

1461
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:35,280
not all of it is necessarily uh perfect

1462
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:37,200
uh there are some risks there

1463
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,680
um and at the end of the day of course

1464
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,079
the national regulators play a big role

1465
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,720
but i do think that companies have to be

1466
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:46,400
brought under greater control

1467
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,640
uh the u.n may not be the best outfit

1468
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:49,760
for it they

1469
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,240
they are struggling to maintain uh some

1470
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:53,760
respect for human rights among their own

1471
00:53:53,760 --> 00:53:55,440
member states let's not forget

1472
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,440
so i'm not sure that uh bringing

1473
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:58,720
companies within the

1474
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,640
rubric of the un will be the best way of

1475
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,480
dealing with it but certainly

1476
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,119
companies need to be regulated and they

1477
00:54:05,119 --> 00:54:06,960
are regulated in many sectors so this is

1478
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,000
not a new

1479
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,319
new issue yeah and then that's one of

1480
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:11,280
the things that often

1481
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:12,960
forgot there are lots of laws that do

1482
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,800
apply to companies and it's not a

1483
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:16,400
completely law free space that's

1484
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,240
important and another initiative of

1485
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,760
course is the global network initiative

1486
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,440
which is very relevant in this

1487
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,680
specific uh sector we are talking about

1488
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:24,559
the digital one

1489
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,960
uh uh anias i think that the question

1490
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:27,760
from ines

1491
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:29,440
uh you can wear both your hats and

1492
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,200
respond but i think from the civil

1493
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,720
society perspective

1494
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:34,880
is it always seemed that we have civil

1495
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,200
society and the un special reporter on

1496
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,400
one side

1497
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,799
and the state on the other yet we see

1498
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,640
relatively little change

1499
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,599
and rampant impunity what other actors

1500
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,119
can be mobilized to achieve

1501
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:49,040
change and the respect for human rights

1502
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:51,040
such as parliaments and businesses

1503
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:54,400
um uh what what ideas um so

1504
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:58,240
um first of all i i you know i'm

1505
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:01,920
i can assure you that uh we have a much

1506
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:04,160
more sophisticated approach to

1507
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,799
um human rights workers i'm sure she

1508
00:55:06,799 --> 00:55:08,160
does actually

1509
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,440
so um in a lot of campaign

1510
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,000
lots of global advocacy around human

1511
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:16,319
rights situation we will call

1512
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:19,359
on states to intervene it's not we don't

1513
00:55:19,359 --> 00:55:20,720
always work against

1514
00:55:20,720 --> 00:55:23,040
all states we may have a position

1515
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,640
against one state

1516
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,359
and in order to have some impact on the

1517
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,640
human rights situation

1518
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,799
eg in china we do need to call on other

1519
00:55:32,799 --> 00:55:34,079
states to do the right

1520
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:37,280
thing we need to call on other states to

1521
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,680
stand for the u.n charter to stand for

1522
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,520
international human rights so

1523
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:45,680
um it is absolutely not uh

1524
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,000
you know civil society against states i

1525
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,319
think it is a much more diffused and

1526
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:53,520
integrated approach uh to uh to human

1527
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,280
rights

1528
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,680
protection uh with regard to uh

1529
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:58,799
corporate actors

1530
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,280
of course they have a role to play at

1531
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,160
the moment

1532
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,000
like i said i found there will be too

1533
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
limited further

1534
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,880
to go back to the previous questions um

1535
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,680
over the last 10 years our capacity to

1536
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,920
hold corporate actors

1537
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,240
for human rights violations has actually

1538
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,440
decreased

1539
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,359
you know we used to be able to do far

1540
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,680
more under american thought law

1541
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:25,520
uh and around uh other laws related to

1542
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:26,480
uh to terror

1543
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:30,079
to um to a torture that has actually

1544
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:33,119
shrunk due to some jurisprudence at the

1545
00:56:33,119 --> 00:56:36,319
european level it is impossible to hold

1546
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,240
corporate actors to account for human

1547
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,520
rights violations they may have

1548
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:40,880
committed abroad

1549
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:44,000
or very difficult the european uh

1550
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,280
jurisdictions have not uh managed

1551
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,559
in fact to develop the system uh

1552
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,280
or the legal jurisprudence or the the

1553
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,640
legal framework

1554
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,680
that allows for that uh to happen

1555
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,040
so um there are real limitations at the

1556
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,520
moment

1557
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,920
in terms of holding corporate actors for

1558
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,960
a camp

1559
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:06,880
for human rights violation they call it

1560
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,880
abroad we may do that

1561
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,520
inside our country but for what they do

1562
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:12,000
abroad

1563
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,160
it's not there it does not mean that we

1564
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,640
do not work with corporate actors of

1565
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:17,359
course

1566
00:57:17,359 --> 00:57:19,920
we i'm sure our arena has many

1567
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:22,000
relationship and so do i with the

1568
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,319
digital corporate actors because they

1569
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:26,400
are part of the solution they may be

1570
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,520
part of the problem

1571
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,440
but they are certainly part of the

1572
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,359
solution and we need to work with them

1573
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:33,680
we need to come up with recommendations

1574
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,799
we need to understand um maybe the

1575
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:39,839
the the limitation that they are

1576
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,040
encountering i think as civil society we

1577
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:44,319
also need to work

1578
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:47,599
outside the comfort zone we need to be

1579
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:48,400
prepared

1580
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,680
to make tangible recommendations

1581
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:54,240
not just at a principal level but really

1582
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,799
try to be very practical very policy

1583
00:57:56,799 --> 00:57:57,920
oriented

1584
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:01,119
uh while continuing to push the bigger

1585
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:02,319
envelopes such as

1586
00:58:02,319 --> 00:58:05,280
um you know demanding or suggesting that

1587
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,200
the international legal framework

1588
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,920
need to be adapted to the 21st century

1589
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,839
which means that we need to find a role

1590
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:13,760
for non-state actor

1591
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:16,000
thank you we have almost just one minute

1592
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,839
so we are really on time so irene in

1593
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:18,880
only one minute

1594
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,640
i'm sorry it's a profound question and

1595
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,240
it's very hard to see it

1596
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:24,400
but this is from mark will the un

1597
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,160
secretary general's creation of an

1598
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,040
office of the

1599
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,920
envoy on technology help you in

1600
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,839
promoting rights online

1601
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:33,920
and positive action by member states and

1602
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,559
global tech companies

1603
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:38,640
uh yes i think so because at the at the

1604
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:39,920
political level uh

1605
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,200
it will show support and technology um

1606
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:45,760
is not um you know there are specialized

1607
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,040
agencies in the un

1608
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,680
that uh work on technology but within

1609
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:51,599
the un secretariat in the

1610
00:58:51,599 --> 00:58:55,280
main part of the un there isn't a place

1611
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:58,640
uh where one can have uh

1612
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,160
you know conversations about technology

1613
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,680
the future of technology the secretary

1614
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:03,119
general of course has a road map

1615
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,640
on digital technology and as i said

1616
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:06,079
technology is not just about social

1617
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:07,200
media platforms

1618
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:10,400
or even about human rights it has cut

1619
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,880
a cross-cutting impact on everything

1620
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:14,960
that the u.n does peace security

1621
00:59:14,960 --> 00:59:18,400
development human rights and it's very

1622
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:18,960
important

1623
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,760
to make sure that all parts of the un

1624
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:22,160
are

1625
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,079
going in the right direction uh to

1626
00:59:24,079 --> 00:59:26,079
improve people's lives and livelihoods

1627
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,400
and protect their rights so yes it would

1628
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:29,839
be helpful to have

1629
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:32,880
a a strong center there i mean that's an

1630
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,240
easy question i think

1631
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:35,680
thank you and that's a very nice

1632
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,839
positive note to end this very

1633
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:40,240
difficult question because it is a grim

1634
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:41,280
and uh

1635
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:43,680
and you know not not a very uh not a

1636
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:45,440
topic on which one can be very hopeful

1637
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:46,160
about

1638
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,880
but thank you for both of your excellent

1639
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,240
work in this regard we

1640
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:53,440
await uh the outcomes with great uh

1641
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:57,280
anticipation and support uh as amnesty

1642
00:59:57,280 --> 01:00:00,079
and as a special rapporteur those of you

1643
01:00:00,079 --> 01:00:01,760
we have freedom of speech which we have

1644
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,119
taken for granted

1645
01:00:03,119 --> 01:00:04,799
but there is always it's important to

1646
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:06,559
freedom after speech

1647
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:08,960
and freedom to reach so thank you very

1648
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:10,559
much again

1649
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:15,839
thank you bye-bye
