00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,040
just talking before we went live about

75
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,840
um

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,640
both of us having done work in the latin

77
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,720
american region on some of these issues

78
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,159
particularly with uh

79
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,000
with treaties that the us trade rep has

80
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,440
been

81
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,560
very active in improv promoting through

82
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,159
the latin american world and not to

83
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,480
the benefit of that region i think most

84
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,720
recently there was the mexican copyright

85
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,959
law that passed last july

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,720
and which we successfully campaigned to

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,319
have uh subject to judicial review

88
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,120
so uh thank you corey so that the first

89
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:53,599
thing i

90
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:56,080
i would like to talk with you is

91
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
something that is uh

92
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,519
well it's not in the news because it's

93
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,640
it's something that

94
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,760
interested uh most people like us but i

95
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
think it's a very interesting thing for

96
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,519
rightscom now and it's a decision on

97
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:13,120
on the supreme court last week

98
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:16,320
on bambooden versus the united states

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,600
on the cfa which i know

100
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,720
you are one of the most critical uh

101
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,199
you have a very critical view of this

102
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:25,840
law

103
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
and of course last week when we knew the

104
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,880
result of this case

105
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,280
uh everybody thought on iron schwartz

106
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,800
and what would have

107
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,080
happened where in this case uh

108
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,440
when applying this this narrow version

109
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:43,440
of the cfaa and so

110
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,800
i i would like to start this

111
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,800
conversation asking you what's your

112
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,000
first uh

113
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,240
um sensation what's your first uh

114
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,280
perspective

115
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,759
your first view on this bamboo and

116
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,000
versus united states case on

117
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,039
this interpretation of the cfaa

118
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
well i i think there was tremendous

119
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,400
relief uh

120
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,039
because the van buren uh the the facts

121
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:08,639
surrounding van buren not the facts

122
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,160
about what van buren did with the

123
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
computer system

124
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,840
but who he was and what the context was

125
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,680
made it made for a very unsympathetic

126
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,440
defendant i mean one of the

127
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,160
things about about aaron schwartz's case

128
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,960
is that

129
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,479
he was a very sympathetic victim of the

130
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,600
cfaa

131
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:28,800
a lot of the times we've seen cfa law

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,840
bad cfa law advanced because the

133
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,440
government and the private actors who

134
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,120
invoke it

135
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
choose their battles and they they like

136
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
to pick on people who

137
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,680
uh are uncharismatic and whose case is

138
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,720
harder to make

139
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,199
but of course once the precedent is set

140
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,000
then it can be

141
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,160
wielded against everyone not just the

142
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,520
not just the people who

143
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,759
we wish would be curtailed in their

144
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
behavior in this case van buren was a

145
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,120
police officer who took a bribe to help

146
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:59,199
someone who wanted to find out whether a

147
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,240
sex worker

148
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,360
whom he was involved with in some

149
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:06,560
kind of nefarious scheme was actually an

150
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,639
undercover police officer

151
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,919
and uh it's you know those are

152
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,120
um the kinds of facts

153
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,160
that i think most of us recoil from

154
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,720
and would be delighted to see the the

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,080
villain of that story

156
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,160
held to account and so it's hard to

157
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,039
argue that we shouldn't distort a law

158
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:28,880
to hold someone who has done something

159
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,759
terrible responsible for their actions

160
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,880
and so when the decision came down that

161
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,639
held that whatever else

162
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,560
mr van buren or officer van v former

163
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,319
officer van buren was guilty of

164
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,280
he wasn't a hacker uh and he hadn't

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
violated a cyber security law and that

166
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,639
the cyber security law that they'd

167
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,080
invoked this 1986

168
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,360
law that ronald reagan rushed into law

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,759
after after watching the movie war games

170
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,599
and having a panic and then

171
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,120
letting a bunch of federal prosecutors

172
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,199
whisper in his ear that there should be

173
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,800
a statute against

174
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,319
computer intrusion that was so broad

175
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:03,520
that the government could use it just

176
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,240
about

177
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
against anyone that that law didn't

178
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,440
didn't and couldn't cover the the

179
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,759
specifics of what van buren was accused

180
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:14,960
of which was that

181
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,800
he was accused of having a computer that

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
he that he was allowed to access but

183
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,039
using it in ways that he'd been told not

184
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,840
to and this was equated to breaking into

185
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,599
a computer that he wasn't allowed to

186
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:26,400
access

187
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
and the court very wisely drew a

188
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,599
distinction although they also put in a

189
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:30,400
footnote

190
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,240
that said we're not really drawing this

191
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,880
distinction in the way you think we are

192
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,639
that has left everyone who's read that

193
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
footnote going well then exactly what

194
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,599
are you doing

195
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,759
and and i i think unfortunately it

196
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,120
reaffirms the

197
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,599
widespread perception that lawmakers and

198
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,400
judges

199
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:48,160
don't understand technology well enough

200
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,680
to regulate it which i think is

201
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,840
a very dangerous perception that leaves

202
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,840
us kind of in a nihilistic void

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,280
yes i totally agree with you but my my

204
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,919
first view on this case was exactly the

205
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:02,560
same as

206
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,919
this is someone doing something wrong

207
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,199
uh but the kind of of regulation that

208
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:10,000
they were

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
using to prosecute him uh was wrong

210
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
as well so it's it's uh this uh thinking

211
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,039
about a

212
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:19,680
broad interpretation of the law uh would

213
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,160
be

214
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,319
very dangerous even while there's there

215
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,280
was a lot of people

216
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,680
in the in the privacy community that

217
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
we're asking for this interpretation

218
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,840
because of privacy issues and and

219
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
that leads us to my my next

220
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,760
topic i would like to to address in this

221
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,880
conversation

222
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,159
is that um what do we do

223
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
with the issue of privacy when we don't

224
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,720
have enough regulations

225
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
uh but when we are in this

226
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,120
situation in in this uh this this

227
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,720
concept that shoshana subwoof usually

228
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,000
she made this this concept of the

229
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,480
surveillance capitalism we have to deal

230
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,000
with surveillance capitalism

231
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,760
yes but we have to deal with the right

232
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,440
laws and that's my

233
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,160
my idea as well and i guess we share

234
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,720
this

235
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,760
this uh perspective on that the

236
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,839
problem is not only the problem of

237
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,200
privacy but of course

238
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,720
concentration which uh puts the

239
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,080
the second issue i would like to address

240
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,200
today is this idea of a concentration in

241
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,640
the big tech

242
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,160
how do we regulate this big

243
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,880
tech in order to deal with this

244
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,640
concentration

245
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,760
especially thinking from the south uh

246
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,040
as i told you i'm from latin america

247
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,360
uh but when we deal with concentration

248
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,720
issues it's like

249
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
we can we can't do anything from here

250
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
because it it

251
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:51,600
we are all the time watching out the

252
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,680
antitrust authorities in the european

253
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,240
union

254
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,760
and in the us uh so i would like to

255
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
uh to get into this topic which is a

256
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,680
really really complicated topic

257
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,040
on the what is the situation right now

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
in this competition er investigations

259
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:13,839
in the u.s and how do you think

260
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,079
we could from the countries from the

261
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:16,880
south

262
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,800
uh have a say on this situation that

263
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,920
it involves us as well well you've

264
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,360
raised so many issues i'm actually

265
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
making notes on all the different things

266
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
i want to say

267
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,880
i let's i i think productively we could

268
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,079
subdivide that question

269
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:33,279
because it's a very good one but it

270
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:35,360
touched a bunch of different areas so

271
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,040
the first part of your question was

272
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,880
about the suitability

273
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,680
of using non-privacy laws to protect

274
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,160
privacy so i'm up i'm a

275
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,160
i'm a really thorough going privacy

276
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,399
advocate i i'm a strong believer in

277
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,040
privacy

278
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,320
and and i oppose surveillance um

279
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,920
however i i think that in order to

280
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,399
address privacy we need privacy law and

281
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,800
and i'll give you an example from

282
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,440
the early part of this century about

283
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,000
about the

284
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,720
failings of a privacy law of a

285
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,640
non-privacy solution to a privacy

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,839
problem

287
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,640
i started to get emails around the year

288
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,200
2003

289
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,440
from people saying i showed up for our

290
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,360
date but you weren't there

291
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,880
and i said i don't understand what you

292
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
mean and they said well i answered your

293
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,120
profile on this dating service

294
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:25,519
and we set up a date so i went and i

295
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:26,880
looked at the dating service

296
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,240
and there was someone had set up a

297
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,640
profile using my identity

298
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,079
and i i emailed the dating service and i

299
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,920
got something back saying you know we

300
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,000
i forget what it was but we don't deal

301
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,680
with that or we'll we'll consider it or

302
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:40,160
whatever

303
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,519
and in the meantime i was still getting

304
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,480
these replies so i actually rang them up

305
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,160
and they said oh we actually can

306
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,399
expedite your problem

307
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,320
all you need to do is claim a copyright

308
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,160
on the photo in your profile

309
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,480
and we'll take it down and there were a

310
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,240
lot of problems with this you know

311
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,399
one was that it was a creative commons

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,160
licensed image

313
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,279
but another was that there are

314
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,639
certainly instances in which people

315
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,160
could have their identity stolen their

316
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,079
privacy violated in this way

317
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,440
that didn't involve a copyright

318
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,440
infringement and so

319
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,800
the the remedy would

320
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,720
would be limited to this very narrow

321
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,000
subset of

322
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,040
of people who had done a copyright

323
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,839
violation in addition to a privacy

324
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:25,680
violation and if you care about privacy

325
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,519
you should actually really want there to

326
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,880
be a

327
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,200
fit for purpose sui generous privacy

328
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:33,600
rule the gdpr

329
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,920
goes pretty far towards it although it

330
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,480
has pretty lacks enforcement and

331
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,079
there are elements of it that i think

332
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,000
are problematic including right to be

333
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,959
forgotten

334
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,800
but at least it it it frames privacy

335
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,360
as a subject unto itself and it seeks to

336
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,360
regulate privacy in that way

337
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
rather than for example creating a

338
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,000
system of expedited content removal

339
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,560
that would align the interests of people

340
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,839
who care about privacy

341
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,600
with people who want to accomplish uh

342
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,279
illegitimate censorship

343
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:04,639
because you know i've had lots and lots

344
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,079
of people in my career as a journalist

345
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:06,959
write to me

346
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,839
and claim falsely that copyright allowed

347
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:10,720
them to remove

348
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,519
criticism of wealthy people or corrupt

349
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,720
corporations

350
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,800
and we want a robust protection of

351
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,160
speech

352
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,000
robust regime of speech protections so

353
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,360
it seems to me that the way that you

354
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,399
balance those

355
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,240
is by having two different rules a

356
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,600
speech protection rule

357
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,560
and a privacy rule and that uh the

358
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,519
privacy rule

359
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,800
is the exception to the speech

360
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
protection rule and not that we say

361
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,079
speech protection

362
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,240
is in in contention with privacy

363
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,000
so i think that's my answer to the first

364
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
part of your question there and i wanted

365
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,639
to get your

366
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,639
take on that before we can move on then

367
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,160
to surveillance capitalism and market

368
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,839
concentration and then maybe to regional

369
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,279
remedies

370
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,120
well and you know i'm also worried about

371
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,399
intellectual property and

372
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
and the uses of intellectual property

373
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,839
for censorship

374
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,600
uh here in the region we we don't have

375
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,199
the same kind of uh

376
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,800
um regulations as dmca for example here

377
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,880
in argentina and euro y

378
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,000
and chile in brazil you need a

379
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,959
warrant to put something down so people

380
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
is using dmca

381
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,519
so the people who want to censor

382
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:23,040
some contents they use dmca which is a

383
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,920
foreign

384
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,120
regulation to download uh contents here

385
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,320
in the region so

386
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,440
that dmca also has an impact abroad the

387
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,240
us

388
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,480
uh because it is the one that regulates

389
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,199
all the the major platforms that

390
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,120
i have the obligation to comply with the

391
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,839
mca so we are suffering dmca

392
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,399
here in the south even while we stopped

393
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
any initiative to have

394
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,839
something like that in in in our country

395
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,040
at least in argentina but um

396
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,360
but uh i i think the the problem on

397
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,720
intellectual property is

398
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:00,560
it's part of the main problem and

399
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,880
that that is concentration because

400
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
intellectual property

401
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,120
contributes to concentration in fact

402
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
and this is another thing i would like

403
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,480
to to ask you but

404
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
let's let's move on with the second part

405
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
of my first questions and so we don't

406
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:14,880
mix

407
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,199
questions and we we have a little bit

408
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,279
more order in this conversation because

409
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:19,920
i have

410
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,440
a lot of things to ask you

411
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,519
yeah okay so i want to move on to

412
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,040
surveillance capitalism

413
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,680
uh and and give the the uh coiners

414
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,320
they're due

415
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,040
so before zuboff used the phrase uh some

416
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,279
leftist academics published on it uh

417
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,440
out of british columbia uh zubov did

418
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,279
popularize it and she popularized a

419
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,639
version that was a little different to

420
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,560
theirs

421
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,600
zuboff is a business school professor

422
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,720
uh and a very good thinker and uh

423
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,440
and quite a strong believer in markets

424
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,079
and

425
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,240
her criticism of surveillance capitalism

426
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,920
is not a critique of capitalism

427
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,000
which the the the first people who

428
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,600
really use the term used it to critique

429
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,199
capitalism itself

430
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,000
her criticism is more by way of being a

431
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,320
criticism of a flavor or strain of

432
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,360
capitalism

433
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,440
she calls surveillance capitalism the

434
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,040
rogue capitalism

435
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,199
so most of the audience probably knows

436
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:16,079
this but the theory of markets goes

437
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,560
that we have a lot of stuff we have a

438
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:19,360
lot of people

439
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
and people want stuff and figuring out

440
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,839
who should get which stuff is hard

441
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:25,360
and so the way that we figure out who

442
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,680
should get which stuff is not by

443
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,360
putting everyone's wants and needs into

444
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,959
a giant computer program

445
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,040
and asking it to allocate them it's by

446
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,360
having a market that aggregates the

447
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,160
decisions

448
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,959
of producers and consumers what you are

449
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,839
willing to do

450
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,680
for money and what i'm willing to pay to

451
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,040
get you to do stuff

452
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,279
and that somehow this creates a kind of

453
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,360
self-correcting machine an invisible

454
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:50,240
hand

455
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
that creates these efficient allocations

456
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,639
now you may or may not believe that

457
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:56,639
but if you but but if you do think that

458
00:16:56,639 --> 00:16:58,240
that's true

459
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,759
then zuboff's problem is that

460
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,199
she thinks that the tech companies

461
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:08,000
are telling the truth when they say to

462
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:08,799
people who buy

463
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,400
ads that they can use machine learning

464
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,319
and big data to override

465
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,319
people's critical faculties and get them

466
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,559
to do the thing that that is advertised

467
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,640
by the thing that's advertised

468
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,359
uh and that they created this for

469
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,799
commercial purposes but it's been

470
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:27,760
hijacked for

471
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,440
political purposes so you know the way i

472
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,400
shorthand that is you know google made

473
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,880
a um a mind control ray to sell your

474
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,480
nephew fidget spinners

475
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
and then robert mercer stole it and made

476
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,640
your uncle a q a non-nazi

477
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,360
right and uh i think that there's a and

478
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
so she says that if that's what's going

479
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,000
on right if

480
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,919
if your decisions aren't being made

481
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
freely by you but rather dictated by

482
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,039
market actors

483
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:53,280
then the market is no longer aggregating

484
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,320
decisions

485
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,480
it's imposing its will so it's a kind of

486
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,000
command economy

487
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,120
and she says that this is

488
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,200
self-reinforcing because the companies

489
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:01,840
can

490
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:04,000
then distort policy and distort our

491
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:04,880
choices

492
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,480
so that they can gather more data and

493
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,000
the more data they have

494
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,760
the better they can control our behavior

495
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:11,039
and the better they control our behavior

496
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:12,480
the more data they can get out of us the

497
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,799
more favorable policies they can acquire

498
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,880
and for me the problem with all of this

499
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:18,720
is not that surveillance is bad not that

500
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,080
the companies are too big and not that

501
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,520
they don't destroy policy

502
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:24,000
it's that that belief that although the

503
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:24,880
companies

504
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,200
routinely lie about everything their

505
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,280
labor policies how their ad markets work

506
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,720
whether or not they're surveilling you

507
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,080
how they handle your data

508
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
you know everything that they do is a

509
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,600
lie

510
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,120
except when they're talking to their

511
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,280
customers and that's the only time they

512
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,720
tell the truth

513
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,400
and i think that that is a really

514
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,640
implausible position

515
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,000
i think it would be implausible no

516
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
matter what claim they had made to their

517
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,120
customers they were talking about but

518
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,320
when we talk about

519
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,000
the ability to bypass our critical

520
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,320
faculties to determine our behavioral

521
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,720
outcomes to control our minds

522
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
we should as recipients of that claim

523
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,000
demand

524
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
extraordinary evidence because everyone

525
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,320
who's ever made that claim in the past

526
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
right when the cia was doing mk

527
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,640
ultra when rasputin was convincing the

528
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,280
czar

529
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,160
when pickup artists were selling each

530
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,080
other code words to get women to sleep

531
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:14,960
with each other

532
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,880
when neuro-linguistic programmers were

533
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,400
selling you tapes to listen to in your

534
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,039
sleep

535
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,000
they were all lying right they were all

536
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,600
charlatans

537
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,280
everyone who's ever claimed to be able

538
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,840
to do mind control ray was a charlatan

539
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,400
and so if someone is going to make the

540
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,679
claim that they finally

541
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,600
crack that nut right we should treat it

542
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,280
like we treat claims about

543
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,200
faster than light travel zero point

544
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:39,600
energy room temperature semiconductors

545
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
all that gold fusion all of that stuff

546
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:44,160
we should say time travel right we

547
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
should say

548
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,200
prove it and prove it in a strong way

549
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,960
right not not by

550
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,360
having one study the way facebook did

551
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,600
where they exposed 60 million people

552
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
to a psychic a psychological

553
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,200
intervention in the hopes of convincing

554
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,400
them to turn out to vote

555
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,520
and saw a 0.39 percent effect size now

556
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,440
it's true that 0.39 percent of 60

557
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,960
million is a huge number it's hundreds

558
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,320
of thousands of voters

559
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:09,200
but this was across all precincts right

560
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:09,520
so

561
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,760
yeah it's true if they facebook could

562
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,440
convince

563
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,000
your neighbors 250 000 of your neighbors

564
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,360
to turn out and vote

565
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,240
in a specific way or just vote period it

566
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,600
would sway elections

567
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,039
but that's not what they even claimed to

568
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,159
do they claimed that they could they

569
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,880
could get

570
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:29,280
0.39 of your neighbors to do that and

571
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,640
your precinct

572
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,679
is not so large that 0.39 percent of

573
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,720
them makes a difference

574
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
right that's not that's not the margin

575
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,240
even very close margins

576
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,760
are determined on that's that's single

577
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:42,080
vote margins in most elections

578
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:45,200
and so sorry

579
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,600
as my background is mass communication

580
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,200
so i cannot

581
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,480
do anything but i agree with you on that

582
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,280
the there is no such influence that

583
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,000
direct

584
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,200
influence but uh do you think this

585
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,280
all this propaganda we hear about

586
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:06,159
the platforms being responsible for hate

587
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,799
speech

588
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:10,320
or for attacking the capital or for

589
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,600
the winning or losing an election

590
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,159
or whatever that you you dis already

591
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:16,960
described

592
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,159
is somehow a a way to put

593
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,679
a put put get off

594
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,880
the the deepest problems we have as

595
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,720
societies it's like

596
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,200
some kind of resignation to address the

597
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,240
real problems

598
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,039
maybe i i put myself in a little bit uh

599
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,240
philosophy

600
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,480
with this but uh but i think it's it's

601
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,159
somehow a resignation of

602
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:42,320
dealing with our real problems okay

603
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
let's put facebook and google

604
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,039
and twitter as guilty let's ask them to

605
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
solve these problems

606
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,520
as they can manage all the situation so

607
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,440
it do you think it's a resignation from

608
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:53,840
the

609
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,120
politicians from the the civil society

610
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,480
as well

611
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
so let me let me tell you that i so

612
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,480
here's where i agree with zuboff

613
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,640
and disagree with her so i agree with

614
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,640
her that the big tech platforms really

615
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,200
do

616
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,600
control our behavior but not through

617
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,600
behavior modification techniques

618
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,600
they control our behavior because having

619
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,039
data collected on you all the time

620
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:16,720
distorts the way that you think about

621
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,440
things

622
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:20,640
right and having to use

623
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
facebook in order to talk to your

624
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,400
friends because they've blocked

625
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,159
interoperability see i'm setting us up

626
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,760
for our next conversation here

627
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,679
because they've blocked interoperability

628
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,200
so they've got everyone there and so

629
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,720
everyone has to join because everyone is

630
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,840
there and everyone has to stay there

631
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,360
because everyone is there and nobody can

632
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,120
leave because everyone is there

633
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,440
you know that really distorts our our

634
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,960
behavior

635
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,000
if you want to talk about the ability to

636
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,960
control behavioral outcomes look at

637
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,080
apple

638
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,919
a hundred percent of the apps that apple

639
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,480
customers buy they buy from apple

640
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,320
right that is a that is a perfect degree

641
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,640
of control that's not a 0.39

642
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:59,760
effect size right that is a 100 effect

643
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,440
size now they don't do it by bypassing

644
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,039
our critical faculties they both

645
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,120
do it by abusing ip law which is again a

646
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,559
subject that we're going to come to

647
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,120
later

648
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,520
right so there are these these gross

649
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,400
ways

650
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,640
in which they distort our lives our

651
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,600
behavior

652
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,480
but they're not um accidental right

653
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,280
they're not

654
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,280
they're not nefarious they're right out

655
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,120
there in plain sight

656
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,679
and a good policy would take account of

657
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,440
this and do something about it just like

658
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,600
a good policy wouldn't let oil companies

659
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,799
continue to

660
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,360
uh endanger our planet just like a good

661
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,000
policy

662
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,159
wouldn't let employers endanger their

663
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:35,360
workforce

664
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,320
and i think we have to ask ourselves how

665
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,039
come we get

666
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:41,919
bad policy outcomes and i said before

667
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,679
that i think it's dangerous to assume

668
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,039
that the reason we have bad technical

669
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:46,320
policy outcomes

670
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,919
is that lawmakers and judges don't

671
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,600
understand technology

672
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,200
because if if you have to understand

673
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,880
technology personally

674
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,600
to make a good policy about it then how

675
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:56,400
is it

676
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,120
that with no microbiologists in congress

677
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,360
every american isn't dead of waterborne

678
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,559
diseases

679
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,120
right clearly it's possible for

680
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,799
lawmakers to delegate to expert

681
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:07,520
regulators

682
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,600
who can adjudicate among contradictory

683
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,880
claims from experts

684
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,039
and make a finding of fact that turns

685
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:14,159
into policy

686
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:16,240
where the workings are shown and where

687
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,400
there's a process by which a

688
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,320
an outcome can be changed in the light

689
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,919
of new evidence and where there are

690
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,760
recusals for conflicts of interest and

691
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,279
so on

692
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,400
that procedure is

693
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,320
uh incinerated by monopoly monopoly

694
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,240
turns the procedure by which we

695
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,840
determine the

696
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,480
best available answer to a complex

697
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,919
technical question

698
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:41,840
from a truth-seeking exercise to an

699
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,360
auction

700
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:46,799
and it there's a word for that kind of

701
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,240
corrupt for that kind of outcome and

702
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
it's corruption

703
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,279
and a synonym for corruption is

704
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:52,960
conspiracy

705
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,520
so when you ask yourself why do people

706
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,600
no longer believe in our institutions

707
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,600
why do they conspire or why do they

708
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
believe that there are conspiracies

709
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,360
to do bad things to children why do they

710
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,200
believe that there are conspiracies

711
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,559
to um steal elections and so on

712
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,400
it's it's because they have lived

713
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,000
experience of actual conspiracies

714
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,120
non-hypothetical

715
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,679
non-deniable conspiracies there's a

716
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,200
wonderful book by anna merlin called

717
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,039
republic of lies that looks at the kind

718
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:19,520
of

719
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,559
ethnography of conspiracy and it you

720
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:23,679
know she says like

721
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:25,919
a conspiracist is not lazy right an

722
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,520
anti-vaxxer

723
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,240
is someone who's very energetic because

724
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,440
to sustain

725
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,919
an anti-vax position you have to know

726
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,039
chapter and verse about

727
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:37,360
actual pharmaceutical malpractice right

728
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,480
you have to be able to know

729
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
for example that the sackler family and

730
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,720
the other opioid manufacturers

731
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,520
really did suborn their regulators to

732
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,760
kill hundreds of thousands of people

733
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,840
and make billions of dollars which they

734
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
smuggled out of the country into tax

735
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,880
havens in which they're gonna get to

736
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,760
keep

737
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,840
right and so in the face of that when

738
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,159
someone says to you vaccines are safe

739
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,279
and you say well our bases for knowing

740
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,080
that they're safe

741
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,440
are claims by the pharmaceutical

742
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,799
companies that have been evaluated by

743
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,600
regulators

744
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,880
and the pharmaceutical companies have

745
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,320
shown themselves to be not fit for

746
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:08,960
purpose

747
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,559
and the regulators have shown themselves

748
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,559
to be bittable why should i believe your

749
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:14,400
claims about vaccines

750
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,320
and you know they're not wrong i mean

751
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,919
they're wrong about vaccines vaccines

752
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,320
are safe you should get vaccinated right

753
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,880
but they're not wrong that there's a

754
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,000
good reason

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,440
to mistrust our institutions and

756
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,480
so i i i think that

757
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,799
the problem with zubav's analysis is

758
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,640
that she doesn't want

759
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,000
to ask whether monopolized markets

760
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,520
have produced the things that she's

761
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,279
worried about in part because she's very

762
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:43,120
fond of some monopolist she's she's a

763
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,159
great fan of apple

764
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,039
and she she buys into this idea that if

765
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,480
you pay for the product you won't be the

766
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,320
product which is obviously not the case

767
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,360
right apple

768
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,760
apple doesn't need to charge fortnite a

769
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,400
30

770
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:57,039
commission to keep you safe apple

771
00:26:57,039 --> 00:26:58,400
charges fortnite a 30

772
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,320
commission because the only way fortnite

773
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:02,400
can reach you is by apple selling you to

774
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,799
them you are the product for apple

775
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,760
right but then then uh corey but the the

776
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,039
how do we deal

777
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:12,000
with uh competition authorities in this

778
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,559
context

779
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,919
because i think that is the the main

780
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:16,480
issue

781
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
for example we have a law here in

782
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,520
argentina

783
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,080
on competition and it's the first time

784
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,760
in history i see it

785
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,960
uh being applied against whatsapp new

786
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,880
terms of use

787
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,840
they started an investigation here but

788
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:32,480
it's

789
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,799
just a little thing that we can do here

790
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:36,799
in brazil in chile in argentina and a

791
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,080
thousand corn

792
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,120
uh without something really

793
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,640
serious from the north uh so the changes

794
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,559
the changes in the perspective on

795
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,640
competition in the in the last decades

796
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,600
in the us

797
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,200
has had a huge impact in the whole world

798
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,360
i i completely agree i mean this is a

799
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,120
problem of america's making in in more

800
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,080
than one regard

801
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,279
so to you know to understand here what's

802
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,880
happened with monopoly enforcement

803
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,039
competition enforcement

804
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:07,039
it was pretty lax there was a there was

805
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:08,399
a brief flurry of competition

806
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,240
enforcement in the late 19th century

807
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,840
mostly about farmers

808
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,600
and mostly about farmers who weren't

809
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,039
worried about selling power but about

810
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,039
buying power which is a really important

811
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,720
area of competition law

812
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,480
because buying power is where you see

813
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,919
amazon crushing

814
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:25,360
both its workforce and its suppliers uh

815
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,640
you know whether those are publishers or

816
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,799
writers or what have you the wage theft

817
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,000
story is a buyer power

818
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,919
story so you know proposition 22 in

819
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,840
california which institutionalized

820
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,919
worker misclassification

821
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:39,200
that's a buyer power issue and

822
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:41,760
competition la lay dormant until the

823
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,080
great depression and the new deal and

824
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,120
then it came back

825
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,720
and it came back with a very muscular

826
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,840
definition of why we would enforce

827
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,039
competition law and that the competition

828
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,000
law

829
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,559
in in america was enforced against

830
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,159
abusive dominance

831
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:01,120
the idea that unaccountable power had

832
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,799
been gathered into a small number of

833
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:03,440
hands

834
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,520
and that however benevolent the dictator

835
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,640
claimed to be

836
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,640
that that lack of accountability would

837
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,679
always end up

838
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,679
hurting someone because there was always

839
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,240
someone for whom a fair outcome

840
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,600
would be dispreferred by the person who

841
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,200
had accumulated all that power and

842
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:20,799
answered to no one

843
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,039
and for decades that was how u s

844
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,799
antitrust law was enforced and when the

845
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:27,039
u.s restructured european law

846
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
after world war ii that was how european

847
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:32,240
anti-antitrust law or competition law

848
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,520
was established

849
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,520
and things sort of puttered along for

850
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,720
about 40 years

851
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,960
and there was um or 30 years rather well

852
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
40 years and there was there was this

853
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,320
presumption

854
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,159
that any time an industry was dominated

855
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,919
by the same firms for more than a few

856
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:46,880
years at a time

857
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,480
that those firms were probably up to no

858
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,640
good and there were um investigations

859
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,200
opened into

860
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,640
just on the basis that the number one

861
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,559
company been number one for a decade

862
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:55,919
right and that you should just probably

863
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,919
look into that because that doesn't seem

864
00:29:57,919 --> 00:29:58,320
the way

865
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,159
that that doesn't look like a market to

866
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,679
to the regulator

867
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:03,440
and starting in the reagan years we

868
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,520
changed the basis for enforcement

869
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,039
and we exported it around the world

870
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,679
again and the new basis for enforcement

871
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,760
was not about harmful dominance but

872
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,440
about consumer welfare

873
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,760
and consumer welfare was was defined in

874
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,440
this very narrow way we said that we

875
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,279
should only enforce against a monopoly

876
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:20,559
when you can prove

877
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:21,760
that the monopoly is going to make

878
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,679
prices go up

879
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,480
and that may sound on its face to seem a

880
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,840
little reasonable no one wants to pay

881
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,360
higher prices but there's two things to

882
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,880
realize about this

883
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,640
first and i think the most important

884
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:33,679
thing about it is that there are a lot

885
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:34,960
of bad things that monopolies do that

886
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,960
don't involve making prices go up

887
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,279
right that they they maim and kill their

888
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:40,000
workers

889
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,120
right they they pollute uh

890
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,279
their environment and sicken the people

891
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:47,360
who live near their facilities

892
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,159
they distort policy by bribing or

893
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,200
coercing or

894
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,399
bullying lawmakers and creating outcomes

895
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:56,080
that are bad for everyone else and good

896
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:57,120
for them

897
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,880
so that's that's i think the most

898
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,159
important reason that that was

899
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,440
inadequate but there's another reason

900
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,480
that it's inadequate that i want to

901
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,519
bring up because it's

902
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:06,960
under its own terms it fails

903
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,880
which is that the way that the chicago

904
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,320
school and robert bork were the

905
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,159
architects of this consumer welfare

906
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,480
standard the way that they wanted to

907
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,880
uh assess whether or not a consumer

908
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,600
welfare

909
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,399
farm harm would happen or had happened

910
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:22,080
was by building these mathematical

911
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,039
models

912
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,880
and happily for them the only people who

913
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,159
knew how to build and interpret these

914
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,840
models was them

915
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,080
and so what would happen is if you

916
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:32,080
wanted to do a merger you would summon

917
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,279
one of them and you would give him a

918
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:34,880
handsome sum of money and he would build

919
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,159
you a mathematical model

920
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:37,600
and he would interpret the model and he

921
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,200
would say the model says it's fine

922
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,919
there will be no consumer welfare harms

923
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:44,799
and then

924
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,360
if you bought your big rival and you put

925
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:48,320
prices up

926
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,360
and a decade went by and the lawmaker

927
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,799
came back to the regulator came back to

928
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,559
you'd hire another one of these chicago

929
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:56,000
school economists and they would build

930
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,200
you another model

931
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,320
and they would say the model tells us

932
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,000
that the prices didn't go up because of

933
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,360
monopoly

934
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,120
there's not nothing to see here folks

935
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,640
move along

936
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,240
it's like the model is on intellectual

937
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,840
property corey

938
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:12,480
it's it's exactly like it and and here's

939
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,679
the important thing right is they

940
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:15,600
converted an area

941
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,320
where the harms were about harms to the

942
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:18,720
um

943
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,679
the dem the deimos where everyone had a

944
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:22,559
reason to

945
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,320
uh to to have some input where everyone

946
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,399
had standing to talk about what was

947
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:28,320
happening to their world

948
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,399
and it turned it into an area where only

949
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,240
people who could build models

950
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,440
got to have a say so those people became

951
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,200
kind of a court sorcerer

952
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,039
and whenever the king said i have a plan

953
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,120
for my empire the court searcher would

954
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,480
drag a goat

955
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,720
into the court and cut the goat open and

956
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,519
spread its goats

957
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:47,919
its guts out on the floor and they would

958
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:50,399
say the goat says the king is right

959
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,159
and then if someone were to have the

960
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,960
temerity to say i've looked at the guts

961
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,399
and i don't see what you're telling me

962
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:58,480
they go look who thinks he can interpret

963
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,840
the guts of a goat

964
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:01,120
right this guy never went to the

965
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,240
university of chicago so

966
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,480
we go from this area where we're

967
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,320
constituted as citizens

968
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,760
to one where we're constituted as

969
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:12,000
consumers and consumers vote with their

970
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:12,640
wallets

971
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,080
and the more money you have the more

972
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,360
votes you get right the thicker your

973
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,760
wallet is the more votes you get

974
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,480
and of course every worker is a consumer

975
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:22,080
and every consumer except for a very

976
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,200
small number

977
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,840
investors are workers and so if we

978
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,919
exempt the harms to workers

979
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,840
from the harms to consumers it means

980
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:31,200
that the only people who actually

981
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,960
benefit universally from a consumer

982
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,840
welfare standard

983
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,360
are the people who don't have to work

984
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,799
right the people who own things for a

985
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:37,519
living

986
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
not the people who do things for a

987
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,720
living and so

988
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:43,519
it's actually killing innovation yeah

989
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,159
well

990
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
yeah so for sure and that now let's get

991
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,080
into interoperability because that's

992
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:48,559
where

993
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,799
that's where it starts to get really um

994
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:52,559
sticky so

995
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,200
in the same period the technology

996
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,480
industry was growing up

997
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,399
ronald reagan hit the campaign trail in

998
00:33:58,399 --> 00:33:59,679
1979

999
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,799
the apple ii plus launched in 1979. so

1000
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,320
these two industries

1001
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,480
the dismantling antitrust industry and

1002
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,600
the tech industry

1003
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,679
they grew together right they were

1004
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:11,839
they're wrapped around each other

1005
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,520
and in the early days of tech you may

1006
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,520
recall it felt very dynamic

1007
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,359
one day everyone had a crazed super

1008
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
computer it was what we all aspired to

1009
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,359
the next day silicon graphics this

1010
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:22,639
company that had just appeared to have

1011
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,239
nowhere bought it the day after that

1012
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,918
silicon graphics was bankrupt because

1013
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,359
people were doing rendering on sun

1014
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:28,399
workstations

1015
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:29,839
and then linux stations built on

1016
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:31,440
commodity hardware

1017
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,399
right one company would be would would

1018
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:35,520
rise to the top

1019
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,040
and then be collapsed by a new market

1020
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,639
entrant ibm

1021
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,239
couldn't make its own operating system

1022
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,839
it got two guys

1023
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,000
you know from seattle to build them an

1024
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,359
operating system

1025
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:48,399
um then you know along came uh

1026
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,520
uh alta vista only to be toppled by by

1027
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,320
google

1028
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,239
and you know it just felt like things

1029
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,480
were always on the on the move

1030
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,160
and when you look at how each one of

1031
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,000
these firms grew to dominance what you

1032
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,680
see is they all did something important

1033
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,359
with interoperability

1034
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,040
which is that they interrupt they

1035
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,800
interoperated in the most rude and

1036
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,480
inconsiderate way

1037
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,040
so when microsoft wouldn't make a good

1038
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,520
client

1039
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,320
for for uh for the mac for windows or

1040
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,680
for word rather and for

1041
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,599
excel and for the other office suite

1042
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:18,880
programs

1043
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,520
steve jobs didn't ask bill gates nicely

1044
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,200
to make him a good program

1045
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,200
he just reverse engineered it or he paid

1046
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,560
someone who understood computers to

1047
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,440
reverse engineer

1048
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,599
one of his engineers and then made a

1049
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:31,680
product called iwork suite

1050
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,280
which he then launched along with a

1051
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,119
campaign called switch

1052
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:36,480
and when people talk about tech

1053
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,920
monopolies they say oh well they're

1054
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,359
monopolies because they have network

1055
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,079
effects

1056
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,599
every time someone makes a new word

1057
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,760
document that's a reason to get office

1058
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,119
right and if it's a reason to get office

1059
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:47,280
it's a reason to get windows but network

1060
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:48,880
effects aren't nearly so important as

1061
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,320
switching costs

1062
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,000
the reason that we care about the

1063
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,560
network effect of microsoft office

1064
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,800
documents all over the world

1065
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,599
is that it's very hard to stay in touch

1066
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,440
with those microsoft office users

1067
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,040
if you don't have a way to read and

1068
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,119
write their files

1069
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,520
that's been the the problem with uh a

1070
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,599
lot of people that i have been a user of

1071
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:10,640
free software since

1072
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,480
20 years now at the beginning of the

1073
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,320
free software movement we have this

1074
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,359
all this this concept of we need inter

1075
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:20,400
open standards interoperability uh

1076
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,920
and and then uh it's like

1077
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:27,440
uh suddenly nobody else is claiming this

1078
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,400
uh is reclaiming this right

1079
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,560
or at least there is just a few

1080
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,480
communities claiming the right

1081
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:38,079
to repair or the right to do

1082
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:41,119
um uh uh uh this

1083
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:45,040
uh this um how i sorry i lost the the

1084
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:45,599
word

1085
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,640
but it is reversal engineering reversal

1086
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,160
engineering it's okay

1087
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:53,280
reversal engineering and but what

1088
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,560
are the uh the the most

1089
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:59,359
worried uh things or regulations that we

1090
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:00,320
have to face

1091
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,079
in in case we have to promote

1092
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,400
adversarial interoperability

1093
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:06,400
which is the regulation that is blocking

1094
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:08,400
it now it's it's intellectual property

1095
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:09,200
as well

1096
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:12,960
or do we it's the cfaa

1097
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:16,079
uh so where do we have to put

1098
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,680
our our uh views our our

1099
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,320
attention yeah so the the early days of

1100
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,680
the free software movement

1101
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,839
you know they had two claims right the

1102
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,119
two two goals

1103
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,040
one was to create open standards so that

1104
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,320
everybody would do

1105
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,160
everything in a way that made it easy to

1106
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,599
interoperate but the other

1107
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,359
was in those cases where there was no

1108
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,440
open standard to just go ahead and do it

1109
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,680
right just just like oh you don't like

1110
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
flash being proprietary reverse engineer

1111
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,359
flash and make a flash run time

1112
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,280
right we're at this adversarial

1113
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,560
interoperability

1114
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,200
and it was you know it was a very kind

1115
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,720
of guerrilla tactic

1116
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,320
but it wasn't distinct to the free

1117
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,800
software world as as i said

1118
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,839
this is what apple did to microsoft it's

1119
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,920
what facebook did to myspace

1120
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,400
it's you know every uh new market

1121
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,160
entrant has done this

1122
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,079
to reduce the switching costs of the

1123
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:08,400
incumbent and neutralize their network

1124
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,599
effects

1125
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:12,160
and the free software movement focused

1126
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:14,160
its attention for a long time

1127
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,040
on closed and open this this stuff we

1128
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,640
have to reverse engineer

1129
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,800
this stuff we can just implement right

1130
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,280
that was that that was the twin poles

1131
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,680
and the thing was that their spectrum as

1132
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,720
it turned out

1133
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,640
was very was too narrow because here you

1134
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,760
have open

1135
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,920
which is takes less work and here you

1136
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:33,760
have closed which takes more work

1137
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:35,119
but what they were ignoring was that

1138
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:37,520
there was a third category

1139
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,560
devouring all the other

1140
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,280
software categories which was if you try

1141
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,960
to reverse engineer this if you try to

1142
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,599
do the work they'll put you in prison

1143
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:49,119
and that's the stuff that's covered as

1144
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,800
you say by intellectual property laws

1145
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,240
and free software people

1146
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:54,240
hate the term intellectual property

1147
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,040
rights i am one of those haters

1148
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,359
yeah well they say oh it's not property

1149
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:00,800
plus are you talking about a trademark

1150
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:02,640
or a copyright or a patent or a

1151
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:05,520
trade secret or a term of service or a

1152
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,280
non-compete agreement or a sue generous

1153
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:08,720
neighboring right or whatever which one

1154
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:09,440
is it

1155
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,960
and here's the thing that i think we we

1156
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
didn't understand is that when business

1157
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:14,640
uses the term intellectual property it's

1158
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,079
not a meaningless buzzword

1159
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,079
it actually has an incredibly precise

1160
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,680
definition

1161
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:22,880
when a corporate officer says

1162
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,480
what intellectual property do you have

1163
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,079
what ip do you have

1164
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:28,320
what they mean is what rules or

1165
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,720
regulations can you avail yourself of

1166
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,320
that will allow you to reach out and

1167
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:34,240
control the conduct of your competitors

1168
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,240
your critics and your customers

1169
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,839
right and they don't care that's why

1170
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:39,760
that's why they don't distinguish

1171
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:40,880
right they don't care if it's a

1172
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
trademark or a trade secret or this or

1173
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,599
that

1174
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,720
right what they care about is not the

1175
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,000
notional goals

1176
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
of different ip regimes disclosure of

1177
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,160
patentable inventions or

1178
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,079
incentive to create in a copyright or

1179
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,880
whatever what they care about is control

1180
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:59,760
and so they fashion these overlapping

1181
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:00,560
layers

1182
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:03,200
where you have a copyright and then the

1183
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,880
copyright has some limitations and

1184
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:06,400
exceptions but those limitations and

1185
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,079
exceptions are covered by a patent

1186
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:09,359
which has some limitations and

1187
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,560
exceptions which are covered by a

1188
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,280
trademark

1189
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,480
which has some limitations and

1190
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:14,240
exceptions which are covered by a trade

1191
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,040
secret

1192
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:18,400
and so the idea is to build up a suite

1193
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,520
of controls

1194
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,280
that allow you to reach outside of the

1195
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,040
boundary of the enterprise and decide

1196
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,040
what other enterprises can do what what

1197
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,160
customers can do can

1198
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,400
can you make a third-party ink cartridge

1199
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,520
can you use

1200
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,760
a third-party ink cartridge can you

1201
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,839
analyze a first-party ink cartridge and

1202
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,760
describe how a third-party ink cartridge

1203
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:36,720
is made

1204
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,880
all of those involve some measure of

1205
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
trademark trade secrecy patents

1206
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:44,560
uh anti-circumvention and other rules

1207
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,440
and the idea is to wrap them all up so

1208
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,160
that you can

1209
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,599
you can control them and so you know

1210
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:50,800
when you look at these international

1211
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:52,400
trade agreements like tpp

1212
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,240
and ttia and so on one of the things

1213
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:56,640
that

1214
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:58,480
that we see is that their ip chapters

1215
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,760
are always written

1216
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,920
with this in mind that that's that's the

1217
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:03,520
way they're structured

1218
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:06,720
is not to protect legitimate interests

1219
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,440
and not to

1220
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:10,160
protect the rule of law but to conjure

1221
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
up a thing that

1222
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:14,079
uh um uh the sorek the guy who started

1223
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:14,880
society of the

1224
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,200
third party apple store he calls it

1225
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,680
felony contempt of business model

1226
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:23,040
right what every firm has dreamt of

1227
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,640
since the earliest days of market

1228
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:25,760
economies

1229
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,079
is the ability just to decide what the

1230
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,599
market would do

1231
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,200
and this is what zuboff is afraid of

1232
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,920
zubat is afraid that a firm will be able

1233
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,920
to decide how you use its products but

1234
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,280
she's afraid that they'll be able to

1235
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:40,720
decide who use its products

1236
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,880
by bypassing your critical faculties

1237
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,880
they don't have to do that

1238
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:47,599
right they just have to use drm and

1239
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:49,920
that's the problem with her analysis

1240
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,760
is that not that she's wrong to be

1241
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,280
afraid that firms can control our

1242
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:53,920
conduct

1243
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,480
but that she's wrong to under theorize

1244
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:58,400
the role that uh ip law

1245
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,440
that competition law plays and to over

1246
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,880
theorize the outlandish claims of

1247
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:08,079
you know self-described mind controllers

1248
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,839
and so the way that we got to this

1249
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,119
policy regime where we have these

1250
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:12,319
terrible rules this

1251
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:13,920
you know the expansion of patents and

1252
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,680
copyrights and so on is because

1253
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,119
monopolies that

1254
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:20,240
used to violate those terms were able to

1255
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:22,079
expand them once they no longer needed

1256
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,440
them they were able to kick the ladder

1257
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,760
away every pirate wants to be an admiral

1258
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,400
and there is a huge responsibility from

1259
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:31,200
the wto in expanding

1260
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,839
this agenda all over the world because

1261
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:34,480
uh

1262
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,720
most of our countries had to change

1263
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,160
their laws

1264
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
the rest of the world had to change

1265
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,760
their laws because of the interest of

1266
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,119
this big pharma

1267
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:46,800
interest the big media the bigger

1268
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,240
entertainment industry and i i would

1269
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:51,119
like to

1270
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,960
especially considering that we are

1271
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,000
having these remote rights come

1272
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,359
and that we are uh going through uh

1273
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:02,560
one of the worst nightmares in in in the

1274
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,079
life of humanity

1275
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,319
that we are uh in the middle of a

1276
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:07,760
pandemic that is uh

1277
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:11,680
impacting really hard especially in the

1278
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,280
southern countries like latin america

1279
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,119
uh i would like to ask you if you are

1280
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,880
following the wto

1281
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:22,160
negotiation on the waiver uh i've seen

1282
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,839
that there was uh in in the last hours

1283
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:26,160
uh

1284
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:29,520
complain from the industry and entire

1285
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:31,280
entertainment industry

1286
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:34,000
saying that if they approve the waiver

1287
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:34,480
uh

1288
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:37,040
they will affect the artists and and the

1289
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,720
writers and the honor

1290
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:41,440
and other people i saw your signature in

1291
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:43,520
a declaration from the artist

1292
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:46,640
saying not in my name so um

1293
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:50,160
um what is your your view on this do you

1294
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:50,720
think

1295
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:54,319
that uh this uh this um

1296
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:56,480
waiver on intellectual property within

1297
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,319
the wto will be

1298
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:00,640
uh will succeed that the the pressure

1299
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:02,560
from the south will succeed

1300
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:04,400
uh and what's your opinion on the

1301
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:07,040
changes in the individual administration

1302
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:10,880
uh and supporting this uh the waiver

1303
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,480
well yeah the biden administration's

1304
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,400
statements so far that the ustr

1305
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:17,440
statements so far

1306
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:20,240
although they fall short of the mark are

1307
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,640
also nothing short of miraculous

1308
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,960
i i as you say i've been around this

1309
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,640
stuff for 20 years

1310
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,720
i i would have bet a kidney

1311
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,200
that i would not live to hear the us

1312
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:34,640
trade representative back

1313
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,800
a waiver but of course it's the right

1314
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
thing to do

1315
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,079
so look i don't want to sound smug here

1316
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,359
i live in california

1317
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:46,240
i'm fully vaccinated my whole family is

1318
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:47,599
fully vaccinated

1319
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,760
um we went to the movie theater this

1320
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:50,640
weekend

1321
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,560
right the movie was terrible but it was

1322
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:53,839
great

1323
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:57,200
right we are well because we have access

1324
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,880
to vaccines

1325
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,000
and the story of not allowing people in

1326
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,200
the global south to make their own

1327
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,880
vaccines and insisting that they

1328
00:45:04,880 --> 00:45:07,839
line up for the doses that are left over

1329
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:10,240
after people like me get vaccinated

1330
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,560
it's i mean on its face it's it's a

1331
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,280
disgusting humanitarian disaster right

1332
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:15,680
it is

1333
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,119
it is a howling moral void to say wait

1334
00:45:19,119 --> 00:45:21,599
your turn until your social betters

1335
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:24,720
and you know if it were me and my child

1336
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,119
who was not vaccinated whose life was

1337
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:28,800
put to risk over this

1338
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,359
i would be incandescent and inconsolable

1339
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:32,480
i would never

1340
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,599
ever ever trust the system again

1341
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:38,800
if that were the case and the story that

1342
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,520
they tell us

1343
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,119
is that the global south has to wait

1344
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:45,839
their turn not just because

1345
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:49,119
businesses deserve to get paid but also

1346
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,119
because poor brown people are too stupid

1347
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:52,960
to make vaccines

1348
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,480
right and that is that that's the

1349
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,880
foundational claim here

1350
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,520
uh and this ignores some pretty

1351
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:00,079
important

1352
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:02,560
issues like the largest vaccine

1353
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
factories in the world are in the global

1354
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:06,160
south

1355
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,200
and when you actually dig into it

1356
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,920
what you find is that the closest thing

1357
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,000
to a credible claim that they have

1358
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,960
is that we have a uh input shortage

1359
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,480
right that we can't get the stuff that

1360
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,400
we need to make vaccines fast enough

1361
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,000
and if we let poor brown people make

1362
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:24,160
their own vaccines rich white people

1363
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,160
wouldn't be able to get vaccinated

1364
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,119
now i think that that's oversold and

1365
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,560
overstated i mean if we think that we

1366
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,079
can eventually get enough

1367
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,400
material inputs to produce vaccines for

1368
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,200
everyone

1369
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,400
then really what we're just talking

1370
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,520
about is some logistical hurdles

1371
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:43,680
but even if not why on earth are we

1372
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:46,319
entitled to to get to the front of the

1373
00:46:46,319 --> 00:46:47,520
line

1374
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,480
when people in the global south aren't

1375
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,400
now that's that's the

1376
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:54,400
sound ethical argument for it but

1377
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,240
there's also a purely utilitarian

1378
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,200
argument for it

1379
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,640
which is that every person who gets the

1380
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,560
virus becomes a factory that produces

1381
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,440
the virus

1382
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,920
by the billions right and every time you

1383
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,440
reproduce the virus there's a small

1384
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,560
chance of mutation

1385
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,160
and every mutation has a small chance of

1386
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,520
becoming more virulent and every

1387
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,200
virulent more virulent mutation

1388
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,800
has a small chance of becoming vaccine

1389
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,280
resistant and we are risking the whole

1390
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,119
goddamn planet the species our

1391
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,880
civilization

1392
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,200
in the name of allowing firms to

1393
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,079
commercialize

1394
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,760
public research now the wto

1395
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:28,559
its basis was the the pact that it made

1396
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:29,760
with the global south

1397
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,240
was every rich country in the world

1398
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,920
ignored intellectual property until it

1399
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,720
was rich

1400
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,760
but you're not going to do that instead

1401
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:38,720
what we're going to do

1402
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:41,200
is we're going to dream up ideas lying

1403
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,640
here in our hammocks

1404
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,400
and we will send those ideas to you and

1405
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,680
your factories

1406
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,680
and then by turning our ideas into

1407
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,359
products you will learn how to have cool

1408
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:50,800
ideas like us

1409
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:53,520
and then you will be able to do what we

1410
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:53,920
do

1411
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,960
and lie in a hammock too but

1412
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:59,040
if it ever comes up that there's a

1413
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:00,400
horrible pandemic

1414
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,079
and everyone's life is at risk and maybe

1415
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:03,520
your kids are going to die

1416
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,599
of course we'll stop insisting on this

1417
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:07,280
thing and will let you make your own

1418
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:08,960
vaccines that was the promise that's how

1419
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:10,240
the wto was structured

1420
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:13,280
that's why there's room for a waiver and

1421
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:15,040
if there was ever a moment

1422
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:18,000
at which the wto waiver process needed

1423
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,960
to be invoked it's

1424
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,359
this moment now the fact that the ip

1425
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:22,000
industry

1426
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,559
the so-called creative industries have

1427
00:48:24,559 --> 00:48:26,240
come out against this tells you

1428
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,000
that it's not about business it's about

1429
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,800
ideology right it's about this idea

1430
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,640
that that um you should be able to lie

1431
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,160
in a hammock and come up with ideas and

1432
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:37,680
get someone else to pay you for them and

1433
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:38,880
moreover

1434
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,720
that if you can structure the market so

1435
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,920
that the people who come up with the

1436
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,079
ideas have to sell those ideas

1437
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,599
to people who work in fancy office

1438
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:48,000
buildings so that they can lie in

1439
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,720
hammocks

1440
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,240
and get someone else to pay them for

1441
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:52,079
them then that is the way that is the

1442
00:48:52,079 --> 00:48:54,000
natural order of things

1443
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,440
and um the thing that the wto waiver

1444
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,000
challenges

1445
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:02,880
is that idea that idea of the justice of

1446
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,079
alienable intellectual property that

1447
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:07,359
ideas should be owned

1448
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:09,440
and alienable and that labor markets can

1449
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:10,480
be concentrated

1450
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:11,760
so that everyone who owns an

1451
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:13,359
intellectual property right can be

1452
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:15,440
alienated of it instantaneously by a

1453
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,800
monopolistic firm

1454
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:18,880
that also has a monopsony and controls

1455
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,319
access to the to the

1456
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,359
uh commercial market and then can accrue

1457
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:24,960
not just a monopoly

1458
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,760
in name right the the monopoly in terms

1459
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:28,720
of market power

1460
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:30,640
but also these authors monopolies these

1461
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:31,839
creative monopolies

1462
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:34,079
and confuse them together to make this

1463
00:49:34,079 --> 00:49:36,319
very durable monopoly where instead of

1464
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:38,240
risking antitrust enforcement by doing

1465
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,640
things to defend a market power monopoly

1466
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,800
instead they just defend their patents

1467
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:44,319
defend their copyrights

1468
00:49:44,319 --> 00:49:45,839
and that is not something any

1469
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:47,200
competition authority in the world is

1470
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:48,400
going to prosecute

1471
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,880
and so um that is the thing that they're

1472
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:52,160
worried about right they're worried

1473
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:52,559
about

1474
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:55,119
the the crumbling of this this perfect

1475
00:49:55,119 --> 00:49:56,319
edifice

1476
00:49:56,319 --> 00:49:58,640
of the market monopoly fused with the

1477
00:49:58,640 --> 00:49:59,920
author's monopoly

1478
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:03,520
that is uh in unassailable by any law or

1479
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:04,720
power

1480
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,440
in in fact uh now that you mentioned

1481
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,920
that uh the issue is controlling

1482
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:12,880
um the the the dissemination of

1483
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,680
knowledge

1484
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:16,400
uh let me tell you that we faced here in

1485
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,839
in argentina

1486
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:19,760
we we have one of the worst intellectual

1487
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,160
property laws in the world not almost no

1488
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,079
exceptions and limitations we for

1489
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:26,079
example i'm also a professor at the

1490
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
university of buenos aires and we cannot

1491
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:32,720
do copies for research or for uh

1492
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,400
our students and in last year when we

1493
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:40,240
went to the remote classes we are still

1494
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:41,680
in remote classes

1495
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,720
and and a lot of uh kids didn't go to

1496
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:45,920
school in in

1497
00:50:45,920 --> 00:50:48,000
they had remote classes we had to

1498
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:49,280
violate the law

1499
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:52,400
we had to be and and and we published a

1500
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,920
lot of articles saying

1501
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:56,559
this is a matter of justice it's not

1502
00:50:56,559 --> 00:50:59,200
that we are thieves it's not that we

1503
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,920
want to steal things from authors uh

1504
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:02,319
it's

1505
00:51:02,319 --> 00:51:05,760
just a matter of justice we cannot

1506
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,000
leave these people behind we need to

1507
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:09,920
have the materials that

1508
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:12,160
all the books that children needed for

1509
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,520
the school and

1510
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:15,920
the uh and and all the materials for the

1511
00:51:15,920 --> 00:51:16,880
researchers

1512
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:20,079
so um before uh

1513
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:22,240
we are already receiving some questions

1514
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,359
from the audience

1515
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,400
uh but i i would like to ask you just a

1516
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,680
short uh opinion your first view on this

1517
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,400
uh

1518
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,440
uh announcement from the g7 countries on

1519
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,319
taxes

1520
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:37,760
the the big tech and this uh 15

1521
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,400
levy that they are uh talking about in

1522
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:40,960
in

1523
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:44,079
we consider it it's uh necessary but not

1524
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:44,640
enough

1525
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,359
but i would like to hear from you uh

1526
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:47,839
just

1527
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,040
a short view on that i mean i would say

1528
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:51,359
that

1529
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,160
that the the best place to look for

1530
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,839
informed commentary on this is the tax

1531
00:51:55,839 --> 00:51:57,760
justice network and nick jackson

1532
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,000
uh and their take on it was that it is

1533
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,079
too low uh gabrielle zuckman said it was

1534
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:03,599
too low he said that it should have been

1535
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:04,079
25

1536
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,359
percent he also points out that

1537
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:07,440
countries can make it 25

1538
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:10,000
15 as the floor not the ceiling but it's

1539
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,160
also structured in such a way

1540
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,960
that while it will help the rich

1541
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:15,920
countries where

1542
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,160
large firms are headquartered it's not

1543
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:19,359
going to help the poor countries where

1544
00:52:19,359 --> 00:52:20,880
they where they operate

1545
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,839
and so it's it's likely to exacerbate

1546
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:25,839
inequality which is not a reason to get

1547
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,599
rid of it it's a reason to make it

1548
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,680
broader

1549
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,200
yes i totally agree well

1550
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,599
we have we are have a few questions from

1551
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:37,599
the audience so i will read

1552
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:40,720
from adrian uh it's a bit wired to

1553
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,720
criticize surveillance capitalism this

1554
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:44,079
this question was posed in the at the

1555
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:46,000
beginning of our conversation

1556
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:49,119
so it refers to the the the criticism

1557
00:52:49,119 --> 00:52:51,520
of surveillance capitalism while not

1558
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,000
addressing capitalism as a whole

1559
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,079
in the surveillance capitalism problem

1560
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,280
mostly

1561
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:00,160
is the surveillance capitalism problem

1562
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,319
mostly a surveillance problem or a

1563
00:53:02,319 --> 00:53:04,800
capitalism problem

1564
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,480
okay so i think it's both in the sense

1565
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:08,079
that surveillance is bad right

1566
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:09,760
surveillance is bad because you can't be

1567
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,520
authentic self under surveillance and it

1568
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,079
helps

1569
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:13,760
autocratic regimes identify and

1570
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,440
neutralize their critics

1571
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:19,200
and it uh abets uh criminals and

1572
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:21,119
harassers and so on

1573
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,480
so there are all kinds of reasons that

1574
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:24,640
surveillance is bad um

1575
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,400
but i also think that the reason we have

1576
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:28,319
so much forbearance of surveillance

1577
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:29,440
right the reason that something that is

1578
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:31,440
so obviously harmful

1579
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:34,640
can take place with impunity is that we

1580
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:36,480
have monopolies right is that is that

1581
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:37,920
markets without

1582
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:40,559
a strong regulation to prevent mergers

1583
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,720
to monopoly and predatory acquisitions

1584
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,240
and predatory conduct

1585
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,240
will over time produce monopolies and

1586
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,760
those monopolies will suborn their

1587
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:48,559
regulators

1588
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,400
and they'll get to do obviously harmful

1589
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,839
things i don't think that we should

1590
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:53,359
abolish all markets i just think that

1591
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,119
market should be viewed as a tool

1592
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:57,599
you know there's there's a an economist

1593
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,440
he calls himself a cowboy economist he

1594
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,040
teaches in texas and he does this

1595
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,559
schtick where he puts on a cowboy hat

1596
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:03,680
and a big belt buckle

1597
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:05,920
and talks about economics on youtube and

1598
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,920
and he his name is john t harvey and he

1599
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,280
says

1600
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,559
being someone who thinks that if you

1601
00:54:10,559 --> 00:54:12,160
can't do it if you can't do it with a

1602
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,599
market you shouldn't do it

1603
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:14,960
it's like being a carpenter only

1604
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:16,640
believes in screwdrivers

1605
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,000
and someone comes along and says i need

1606
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,680
you to nail these two boards together

1607
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,720
and you say look

1608
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,359
buddy no one but a communist would use a

1609
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:24,559
hammer and nails

1610
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:26,720
i'm a screwdriver man and if these two

1611
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:28,079
boards can't be held together with a

1612
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:28,880
screw

1613
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,720
then they shouldn't be held together

1614
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:32,480
right there are things that markets can

1615
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:33,599
allocate well

1616
00:54:33,599 --> 00:54:35,839
um market but markets are a tool for

1617
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,440
allocation they're not

1618
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,079
the only way we can allocate and

1619
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:42,079
planning is important too

1620
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,440
uh and as is regulation and you know

1621
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,200
even the the most uh vicious robber

1622
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,200
baron doesn't run their company like a

1623
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,280
market right like when you go to work at

1624
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,720
amazon

1625
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:56,640
you don't put like bids and puts on

1626
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:58,480
which desk you're gonna sit in

1627
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:01,520
you know commissar bezos has had his

1628
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:04,240
has had his uh his sub commissars assign

1629
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,839
you a work assignment according to their

1630
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,200
five-year plan

1631
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:10,319
right and as johar benkler points out if

1632
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,640
you go down to uh wall street you go to

1633
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,319
a playground where the stock brokers

1634
00:55:14,319 --> 00:55:16,160
have their toddlers playing

1635
00:55:16,160 --> 00:55:18,240
and the these these people who claim

1636
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,559
greed is good and who's can't read their

1637
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:22,319
copies of iron rand anymore because the

1638
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,160
pages are all stuck together

1639
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,160
you know when they see their kids

1640
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:27,599
playing badly in the playground they

1641
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,000
shout

1642
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:31,520
billy share because

1643
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:34,400
everybody knows that it's a shock right

1644
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,920
everybody knows that that

1645
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,880
that idea that greed is pareto optimal

1646
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:39,200
is

1647
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,680
is bs and that you know you don't want

1648
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,440
to you don't live or work with people

1649
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,960
who act that way

1650
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,280
and so yeah i mean sure let's have

1651
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,440
markets where we need markets right fine

1652
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,119
but but let's not assume that if we

1653
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,480
can't do with the market we shouldn't do

1654
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,599
it at all

1655
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:56,720
okay we have just five minutes left

1656
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,319
and we have two questions coming from

1657
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,799
the audience so i i

1658
00:56:00,799 --> 00:56:03,599
put it very very quickly uh do you see a

1659
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:05,119
connection david says do you see a

1660
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:06,720
connection between adversary

1661
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:08,640
interoperability applied to web

1662
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,440
services and restrictions on bots

1663
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,920
originating in broad interpretation

1664
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:17,440
of the cfaa especially surrounding the

1665
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,359
question of circumvention

1666
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,640
yeah 100 so i call it the thicket right

1667
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,160
so the the the what the cfaa does

1668
00:56:26,160 --> 00:56:27,920
like dmc 1201 which is the

1669
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,760
anti-circumvention rule which

1670
00:56:29,760 --> 00:56:31,520
is in most countries in its own guys

1671
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,280
like in europe it's article 6 of the eu

1672
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,319
cd

1673
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:37,040
um what they say is if you if you

1674
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,280
configure your product

1675
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,200
so that using it in ways that benefit

1676
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,839
you instead of the shareholder

1677
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:46,240
requires hopping over a fence

1678
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:47,920
right violating a term of service

1679
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:50,000
removing a tpm

1680
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,880
then the the conduct that is otherwise

1681
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,319
lawful but disfavored by the

1682
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:55,520
shareholders becomes

1683
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:58,160
unlawful and so when you say to people

1684
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,160
all you need to do to make it illegal to

1685
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,680
frustrate your commercial

1686
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:04,720
plans is to prohibit the conduct that

1687
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,000
you disfavor

1688
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,440
in your terms of service then

1689
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:11,040
they will then structure their terms of

1690
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,960
service so that everything that would

1691
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:13,839
benefit you

1692
00:57:13,839 --> 00:57:16,079
at their cost anything that would shift

1693
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,599
value from their side of the ledger to

1694
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,040
your side of the ledger as a user or

1695
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,400
customer or competitor

1696
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
is violated by their terms of service

1697
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:24,720
and therefore a violation of the cfaa

1698
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:26,799
and therefore a felony so absolutely the

1699
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:28,240
cfa is involved with this

1700
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,160
but it's not just the cfa because we we

1701
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,480
still have section 121 of the dmca

1702
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:33,680
and there are some important legal

1703
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,680
questions right now in play with that

1704
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:36,079
where

1705
00:57:36,079 --> 00:57:37,599
facebook for example has argued that

1706
00:57:37,599 --> 00:57:39,440
there's a 1201 violation

1707
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:41,760
by new york university in their ad

1708
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,880
observer project which scrapes ads

1709
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:46,319
and checks to see whether they comply

1710
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,079
with facebook's political disinformation

1711
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:48,960
policies

1712
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,119
and facebook says that there's a dmca

1713
00:57:51,119 --> 00:57:52,319
violation

1714
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:55,040
in in scraping the ads a dmc 1201

1715
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:55,920
violation

1716
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:58,000
oh no i beg your pardon they say it's a

1717
00:57:58,000 --> 00:57:59,520
cfaa violation

1718
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:02,079
youtube says that youtube dl which is a

1719
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:04,079
youtube downloading tool is a 1201

1720
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:06,400
violation but in both cases

1721
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,640
we have large firms that are that are

1722
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,240
seeking to use

1723
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:13,440
uh these very broad laws

1724
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:15,280
to literally criminalize doing things

1725
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:16,319
that their shareholders wish you

1726
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:17,119
wouldn't do

1727
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:19,040
which would otherwise be legal except

1728
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,480
for the way that they've deployed some

1729
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,960
technical aspect of their service

1730
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,960
and we are running out of time so i i

1731
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:27,520
just uh put valeria's question i believe

1732
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:27,920
that

1733
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:30,640
very notion of open and openness need to

1734
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,240
still be claimed in their current

1735
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:32,960
implications

1736
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:35,520
and i'm concerned about how capitalism

1737
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,040
and the ip regime

1738
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:39,599
have also co-opted the terms and their

1739
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:40,160
notion

1740
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,520
what come to narrative uh we

1741
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,920
the question is for both of us feel we

1742
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,200
need to embrace

1743
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:49,040
in our advocacy for regulations

1744
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,040
currently and in the post-pandemic

1745
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,000
scenario and

1746
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,359
this will be our last-minute remarks

1747
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,720
well i know how i'd answer it but i'd

1748
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,480
like to hear your answer

1749
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,200
well i don't know oh okay well then i'll

1750
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:03,200
tell you mine

1751
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,799
oh no unless go ahead no i i mean the

1752
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,480
counter narrative is is

1753
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,680
it's a key issue uh that is very very

1754
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:12,720
hard to build but

1755
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:16,160
we have to claim justice uh and we have

1756
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:16,839
to

1757
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:19,839
stop uh speaking the language of the

1758
00:59:19,839 --> 00:59:23,680
those who want to dominate our narrative

1759
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:26,079
yeah i would i i was very influenced in

1760
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:28,000
this by benjamin mako hill's 2018

1761
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:29,599
library planet keynote

1762
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:32,400
on open versus free and he says you know

1763
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:34,160
we called it free software

1764
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,440
and then they said you need to call it

1765
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:37,680
open because it's scaring people

1766
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,720
and he said that by stressing the the

1767
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:43,599
utilitarian benefits of openness right

1768
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:44,240
code

1769
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,520
auditing and so on what we got

1770
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,440
was open source for all of us and

1771
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,040
freedom for monopolists

1772
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,200
so google has software freedom they can

1773
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,440
deploy software in any way they want

1774
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:57,680
we have open source we can see the soft

1775
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:59,119
the code for their back end we can

1776
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:01,280
submit patches to it and so on

1777
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:03,440
but because all of our apps loop through

1778
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,400
their cloud

1779
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,319
and they have a veto over their cloud

1780
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:08,160
how their cloud works we got openness

1781
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,680
and they got freedom

1782
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,119
and so it follows that we just need to

1783
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:13,040
take back freedom right we need to take

1784
01:00:13,040 --> 01:00:14,079
back software freedom

1785
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:16,480
technological self-determination right

1786
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,319
it's not enough to be able to see the

1787
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,119
code

1788
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,640
you have to be able to use the code to

1789
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:22,480
realize your life

1790
01:00:22,480 --> 01:00:25,280
the way you want to live it so free

1791
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,799
software for everyone

1792
01:00:26,799 --> 01:00:29,520
so it was a pleasure a big pleasure for

1793
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,680
me

1794
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:35,119
yes so this is we have reached the end

1795
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,000
we have no more time so thank you corey

1796
