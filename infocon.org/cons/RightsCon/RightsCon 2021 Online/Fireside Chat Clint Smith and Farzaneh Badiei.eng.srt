joined discord f two years ago

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
after the loss of my friend because i

13
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,079
was looking for

14
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,039
a social media platform that was not so

15
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,680
large

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,480
so i was seeking refuge i am thrilled

17
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
that after two

18
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,320
years they're still around and they're

19
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,760
with us today

20
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:03,600
to have a chat with us about their

21
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
governance uh

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,159
mechanism and also they

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,520
want to they have a global vision and

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,799
they want to

25
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,960
build on that and i am sure that the

26
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,400
rightscon community

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
can contribute to that

28
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,720
this court has a community governance

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,040
mechanism which means that they are

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
after building communities

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,159
instead of just expanding their uh

32
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,759
user base and their consumers

33
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,439
as well as they want to go beyond the um

34
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,479
san francisco bay borders and

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:44,079
join the more global governance

36
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,600
landscape that we contribute to

37
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,119

64
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,280
global perspective

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,599

rights groups that are doing

67
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,200
important work and as someone who has

in the united states

73
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,280
it's very meaningful to see the topics

74
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,120
and and the people here

75
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,640
in terms of my career track i spent

00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,560
many years in washington d.c working on

77
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,879

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,480

content moderation

81
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,599
topics around the world and then i've

82
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:24,720
been in silicon valley

83
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:27,200

00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,480
corporate law and m

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
a and ipos and discord is a wonderful

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,200
combination of of the two for me

87
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:35,680
uh and so at discord i have a legal team

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,080
that works on contracts and patents and

89
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:40,480
stock filings but i also have a policy

90
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,120
team

91
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,000
that works on our product design making

92
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
sure our product has trust by design

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,200
built into it

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,760
our platform policies making sure that

95
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,760
the rules the community guidelines that

96
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,280
apply to our platform

97
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
uh are clear and understood and a trust

98
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,680
and safety organization that's actually

99
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,480
handling

100
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,439
uh reports on our platform of bad

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,080
behavior and also proactively looking

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,439
for for harmful material and then

103
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,760
in terms of being a leader this is an

104
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,040
important part of my job

105
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,879
as a leader at discord one thing i need

106
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,879
to do is to go outside the walls of the

107
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,599
company

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,759
and bring back ideas and the chance to

109
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,199
connect with you the chance to connect

110
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
with other people

111
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,560
at rights con is an important part of my

112
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
job to to learn to listen

113
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,960
to bring back ideas to discord and

114
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,080
decide how we can

115
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,400
uh implement best practices and new

116
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:31,680
approaches to the problems we're

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,840
tackling

118
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,960
great thank you so why did discord even

119
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,880
come about and how did you actually

120
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,720
survive the dominance of

121
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,759
big large tech corporations

122
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,560
and what is the favorite aspect of this

123
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,560
course business model for you

124
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,280
yeah yeah so we just celebrated our

125
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,639
sixth birthday

126
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,520
uh and our origins were in gaming our

127
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
two founders jason and stan

128
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,160
they became friends through gaming and

129
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,919
as they were growing up they realized

130
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,720
that

131
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
they really found a sense of belonging a

132
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,560
sense of community

133
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,960
among gamers so they originally built a

134
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,479
communications app

135
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,360
so that gamers could communicate and

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,360
they could communicate by text messages

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,280
they could communicate by voice

138
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
and they could communicate by video like

139
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
you and i are doing right now

140
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,960
and it was built for gamers but they

141
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,479
found over time was

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,520
that the pre-game the post game the

143
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,800
hanging out together

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,320
was more important than the gaming

145
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,360
itself and really since 2019

146
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,360
we've been amazed by the broad uses of

147
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,479
the platform

148
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
college clubs are using discord open

149
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,080
source communities

150
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,400
are using discord artists and music

151
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,199
communities

152
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,759
are using discord and we like to think

153
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,479
of it as

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
a place to to come together and connect

155
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,880
and you get to decide whether you use

156
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,880
the text message functionality

157
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,960
whether you use the voice or the video

158
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
and you get to decide whether you're

159
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,160
communicating one-to-one

160
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,039
or one-to-many so we like to use the the

161
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,680
uh

162
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,919
metaphor of a neighborhood and uh in

163
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,440
your neighborhood you might have a very

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,919
intimate one-to-one chat with a friend

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,160
you might have you know 15 friends over

166
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,440
for a dance party

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,360
or you might go out into a public space

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,039
and listen to a live concert in the park

169
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,560
with 20 000 people

170
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,199
and discord enables all of those modes

171
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,639
of communication

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
and uh we think that's you know really

173
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,560
special

174
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
one thing that drives us and

175
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,759
differentiates us is

176
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,680
a different model we like to call

177
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,880
ourselves a

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,360
you know a new model of a social media

179
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,160
platform

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,080
and that comes down to the fact that we

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,840
don't sell advertising

182
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,759
and we don't sell data and so our

183
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
business model is to be paid directly by

184
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,039
our users

185
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,280
and some percentage of our our users we

186
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
have a free app

187
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,240
and we have some paid features and it's

188
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,319
very transparent we tell users

189
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,160
if you want certain features you can pay

190
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,240
us five dollars a month or ten dollars a

191
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:54,880
month

192
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,199
but it's a direct transaction between

193
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:58,080
the users and

194
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,400
us in a very transparent way and that's

195
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,160
really meaningful to us and uh

196
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,800
um you know i i'll share something from

197
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,360
from

198
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,360
my personal life in the context of

199
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,880
discord uh

200
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,199
one of my daughters has type 1 diabetes

201
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,319
and if you were on discord

202
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,039
participating in a group around diabetes

203
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,240
care or management

204
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,000
or a diabetes cure discord doesn't track

205
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,840
that and discord doesn't make that part

206
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
of her profile on discord

207
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,960
and and it really alarms me and and

208
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,919
and you know uh hurts me that on

209
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,680
different platforms you know that might

210
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,680
become part of her profile her medical

211
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,880
condition would become part of her

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,240
profile that then would be sold to

213
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,680
advertisers and so

214
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
i think this transparent model of a

215
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
direct consumer subscription

216
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,280
rather than profiling and ad targeting

217
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,479
is a compelling new way of uh monetizing

218
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,820
a platform and a service like ours

219
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,240
[Music]

220
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:55,360
great so you mentioned um

221
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,400
your you have like neighborhoods and

222
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,639
online neighborhoods and this

223
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,599
sounds like a little bit of like

224
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,280
community governance you have

225
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,319
in place so and um

226
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,919
civil society is sometimes as skeptical

227
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,759
about community governance

228
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,560
because community leaders can become

229
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,120
gatekeeper keepers so they can become

230
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,919
too friendly with you and become

231
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,360
dictators

232
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,240
and either do what the corporations tell

233
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:26,720
them

234
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,160
or uh do whatever they want um

235
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:32,799
can you tell the skeptics of thing or

236
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,200
two

237
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,360
about your governance mechanism how do

238
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,279
you actually control that

239
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,039
not that you will convince us but you

240
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,000
know you can't put us at ease

241
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
so you know i have a strong conviction

242
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,000
that community governance works because

243
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,360
i see it work

244
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,080
every day across so many different

245
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,519
discord communities

246
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,200
but but let me back up a little bit and

247
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,040
talk about our approach to governance

248
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,680
because

249
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,760
uh it has three tiers and it starts with

250
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,600
the user and the product

251
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,720
so when you're using the discord app

252
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
the user is in control you decide who

253
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
you communicate with

254
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,240
you decide the mode of communication is

255
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
it voice or chat or text message

256
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
you decide which communities to join and

257
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,800
if the community is not working with you

258
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,160
we make it easy to start your own

259
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,640
community and and choose the people and

260
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,480
and the norms and behaviors that you

261
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,760
want to operate by

262
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,080
so so really our first approach to

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,600
content moderation

264
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
is putting the user first and putting a

265
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,760
product in their hands that allows them

266
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,519
to customize the experience

267
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,480
to what they want that moment and that's

268
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,120
excre

269
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,839
you know exceedingly powerful the second

270
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,640
part is

271
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,040
our trust and safety team so we have

272
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,320
community guidelines

273
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,600
18 paragraphs they're very strong stands

274
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,519
against hate against groups that promote

275
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:50,560
violence

276
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,760
against harassment and fraud and we do

277
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,480
uh you know regulate our network to try

278
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,360
to find examples of this

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,279
community guidelines being violated and

280
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,120
so you know my team both

281
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,360
in responding to user reports or

282
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
responding to reports from trusted

283
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
reporters in civil society we take

284
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,600
action but we also proactively

285
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,720
go out and uh look for a

286
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,399
behavior that violates our community

287
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,720
guidelines and so you start with the

288
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,360
product

289
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,120
and then you have our trust and safety

290
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,640
team that applies these community

291
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,600
guidelines

292
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:26,800
to every behavior and every post on our

293
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,680
platform

294
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,760
and then you have the community and the

295
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,360
beautif beauty of the community

296
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,480
moderators is

297
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,279
they can have local norms local rules

298
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,160
and they can

299
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,880
uh really use you know pure influence to

300
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,320
keep you in the community

301
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,360
and again i'll i'll invoke one of my

302
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,120
children who's a college student

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,360
in in north carolina and i i was

304
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,160
thinking of

305
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,880
of her behavior during covid and

306
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,800
behaving on a college campus is a hard

307
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,279
thing to

308
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,360
to regulate and there's you know federal

309
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,519
guidance and state guidance and county

310
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,000
guidance and school administrators but

311
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,600
but if you talk to her about

312
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
why she stayed in small groups why she

313
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,760
wore a mask why she didn't go to big

314
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,720
parties

315
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:08,160
it's because she didn't want to let the

316
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,920
other students down she knew that the

317
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,519
school could get shut down

318
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,800
and she's in her second year of

319
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,880
university and she said i want the

320
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,800
fourth year students the seniors

321
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,240
to experience the final year of

322
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
university and i don't want to be the

323
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,600
one who causes all of us to get sent

324
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,160
home

325
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,079
and that to me reflects the power of

326
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,360
community moderation

327
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:28,160
it's a group that cares about each other

328
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,000
following norms and rules

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,839
that they understand because they want

330
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,320
that community to thrive and survive and

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:34,959
so

332
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,560
uh at discord we try to make

333
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,279
the moderators effective in in several

334
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,640
different ways

335
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,560
in december of 2020 we launched our

336
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,480
discord moderator academy

337
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,560
that's a online curriculum of best

338
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,200
practices on how to moderate on discord

339
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,240
we have a suite of tools or bots that

340
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
moderators can use to more effectively

341
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,000
keep their community

342
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,160
healthy and we have a certification and

343
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:01,839
exam so you can become a certified

344
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,760
moderator with a special badge

345
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,760
but we invest a lot in the community

346
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,600
moderators because we think

347
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,560
that a member of the community enforcing

348
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,600
local norms

349
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,079
is going to be the best way of keeping

350
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,240
our communities healthy and vibrant

351
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,320
and so i invite people to discord and

352
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,160
and come talk to a moderator take our

353
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,360
moderator

354
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,839
academy exam and uh i think you'll see

355
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:24,880
moderation

356
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:29,279
uh that works and uh we're proud of it

357
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:33,200
great so um well let's go now that we

358
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:33,920
talked about

359
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,399
uh community governance let's go to

360
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,320
corporation governance and

361
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,360
accountability and transparency is very

362
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,160
important

363
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,720
uh for civil society and other

364
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
stakeholders

365
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:51,120
in this uh digital space and

366
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,360
we are sometimes suspicious and

367
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,079
frustrated by take corporations

368
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,680
transparency reporting it is usually

369
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
not actively contributing to their

370
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,000
policy changes and they drown

371
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:10,480
us in 100 pages of transparency reports

372
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:10,880
that

373
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,600
are not that they can't be even used or

374
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,079
are not

375
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,120
effective so does do you do this at

376
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,839
discord

377
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,600
differently we strive to do it

378
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:22,240
differently

379
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,600
and i issue an open invitation to anyone

380
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
at wright's con

381
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,920
to partner with us and help us have more

382
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:30,880
useful

383
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:34,160
uh more impactful transparency reports

384
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,079
so every six months we issue a

385
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:37,680
transparency report

386
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,680
and i want to dispel the myth that this

387
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,959
is some you know

388
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,199
mechanized process at least at our

389
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,079
company some of our very best employees

390
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,079
the the most tenured employees

391
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,720
work hard at producing uh this report

392
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
i'm in the google doc myself so so we'll

393
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,560
report on january to june

394
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:56,959
and early july i'll be in the google doc

395
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,639
myself asking questions is there a

396
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:00,240
better way to present this data

397
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
are we making an assumption here and do

398
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,440
we need to double click and check that

399
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
assumption

400
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,000
and we put a lot of care into it

401
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,160
each time we've come out with this we've

402
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,040
tried to add

403
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,120
a little bit more context and a little

404
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,440
bit more information that'll be useful

405
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,959
to the outside world

406
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,000
um i'll share a few examples

407
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
um report before last we started to

408
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,120
report on recidivism

409
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,800
so we're very interested in the context

410
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,399
of when to use a warning

411
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:30,399
rather than an outright ban and our

412
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,000
colleague eric goldman in santa clara

413
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,440
has done some excellent work on this at

414
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,440
the different measures you can take

415
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:37,519
we can put a server or community in

416
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,560
quarantine

417
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,399
we can ban someone we can give them a

418
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,720
six hour time out for bad behavior

419
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,199
or a 30-day timeout for bad behavior and

420
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:46,800
so with experimenting

421
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:50,000
with these measures short of an outright

422
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:50,880
ban

423
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,040
we wanted to look at recidivism and so

424
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,680
if we gave you a warning for hate speech

425
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,760
how likely is it that we would ban you

426
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,519
outright for hate speech within 12

427
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:00,560
months

428
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,160
and i'm very proud of the team doing

429
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
extra work to

430
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,680
report on that very topic and if it's of

431
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,320
interest to people we'll keep doing it

432
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,800
the second innovation we made that i'm

433
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,399
proud of the team for doing

434
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,440
was giving more context on appeals and

435
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,240
so

436
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,120
if you have action taken uh against you

437
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,079
by discord

438
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
you have the right to appeal that action

439
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,760
and we're delighted when people do

440
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,519
appeal because we can learn from that

441
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,680
and we can also dialogue and educate our

442
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,639
community

443
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,959
but we're so thoughtful about handling

444
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,240
these appeals

445
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,240
i asked why don't we share more appeal

446
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
information with the world

447
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,279
and so we took three of our appeals and

448
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:38,800
we wrote up a case study

449
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,240
and we said you know in these two

450
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,079
situations this was the basis for the

451
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,800
appeal

452
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,800
and this is why we did not overturn it

453
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
in this third situation

454
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,079
here was you know a legitimate

455
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:50,160
researcher hanging out

456
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,199
with an extremist group to study them

457
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,680
we banned everyone in that extremist

458
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:56,320
community

459
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:58,480
including the researcher the researcher

460
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
came shared their academic

461
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
credentials and it was a chance for

462
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
education like

463
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,160
please don't hang out in these

464
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,079
communities report them to us so we can

465
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:06,639
rid

466
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,279
discord of these communities don't be a

467
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,120
passive lurker in the communities

468
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,320
if you want to be a legitimate

469
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:13,600
researcher but it was a chance for

470
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,240
dialogue

471
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,399
so those were a couple of examples of

472
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,839
how we're trying to advance the

473
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:19,360
transparency report

474
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:22,000
for people at rights con i want them to

475
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,040
know that

476
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:24,800
real humans who are trying to do the

477
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,440
right thing are behind these reports

478
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,040
and that these reports are dynamic if

479
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,720
they're things you want to know about

480
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,399
with respect to discord

481
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,320
moderation discord trust and safety

482
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
discord policy enforcement

483
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,000
tell us and we will do our best to get

484
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,759
that into a future iteration of the

485
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,120
transparency report

486
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,040
we welcome the feedback and we want to

487
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,120
do better

488
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,160
great thank you so um

489
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,639
a lot of these are great things and

490
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,240
they're very hopeful

491
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:56,399
and but when corporate corporations

492
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,079
go global they kind of copy

493
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:03,120
each other's governance systems because

494
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,599
that is more convenient and perhaps

495
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,640
um more efficient

496
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,760
if and when you go global are you

497
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,199
going what sorts of changes are you

498
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:16,959
going to make do you

499
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,799
know that are you going to change your

500
00:17:19,799 --> 00:17:21,119
approach

501
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,480
what if your network is like

502
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,160
like a billion people um what is going

503
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,480
to

504
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,000
change yeah yeah so currently we

505
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,600
have a 150 million monthly active users

506
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,799
uh that's doubled in the last year and

507
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,919
79

508
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:41,919
of those active users are outside the

509
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,200
united states

510
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,679
uh you know we as a discord leadership

511
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,559
team

512
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,200
realize that you know 98 of our

513
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,640
employees are in the united states

514
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,799
but 79 percent of our users are outside

515
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,000
the united states

516
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,640
we need to uh become very effective at

517
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,679
understanding

518
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,080
the the cultures and the norms and the

519
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,120
languages

520
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,679
of uh the rest of the world and and

521
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
we're working on that as a young company

522
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
the first place we go is other companies

523
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,080
and i do have to say that

524
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,160
in the realm of trust and safety other

525
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,919
companies are incredibly generous with

526
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,600
their time and their best practices

527
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,480
so when i joined discord nine months ago

528
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
i immediately connected with colleagues

529
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,679
at verizon

530
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,559
and at microsoft and at snap and at

531
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,000
twitter

532
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,840
and at google and these people are

533
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,679
incredibly generous with their time

534
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:31,200
and sharing their stories of the

535
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,960
struggles they faced as they expanded

536
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,000
around the world

537
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
and uh and how we could learn from that

538
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,600
and i am grateful for

539
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,039
these other companies that are larger

540
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,360
than us helping a smaller company

541
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,039
in the interest of common safety why

542
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,480
would you help someone who is

543
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,000
potentially a competitor

544
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,240
because fundamentally these companies do

545
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,760
care about safety

546
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:53,600
and we connect all the time then they

547
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,840
helped us understand what groups to use

548
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,039
and i'll talk about a few different

549
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,160
groups that have been

550
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:02,000
valuable to us in the realm of

551
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,120
violent extremism and and hate groups

552
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,679
and terrorism we're members of of gift

553
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:08,240
ct

554
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,960
we're members of tech against terrorism

555
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,559
will be joining the christchurch

556
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,360
call and incredible learnings to be had

557
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:16,000
by

558
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
being in those discussions and and with

559
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,200
those

560
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,840
organizations when it comes to sexual

561
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:22,960
exploitation and

562
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,760
child safety we work closely with nick

563
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,160
mick

564
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,760
and ikmak uh we're members of the tech

565
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,480
coalition

566
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
and also the the family online safety

567
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,840
institute and again

568
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
there's such deep expertise about

569
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
protecting children and keeping teens

570
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,600
safe online

571
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:43,440
and we definitely benefit from that

572
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:46,320
and then lastly two more horizontal

573
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,000
organizations the digital trust and

574
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,679
safety partnership there's a coalition

575
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,559
of companies

576
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,559
some of the giants like facebook google

577
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,600
and microsoft

578
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
some of the mid-sized companies like

579
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,919
discord and reddit and pinterest

580
00:19:57,919 --> 00:19:59,440
and we come together to come up with

581
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,919
best practices on content moderation

582
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,440
and then lastly the trust and safety

583
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,200
professionals association

584
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,960
that launched last year incredibly

585
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,960
valuable for a company like discord to

586
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,679
send our employees to events put on by

587
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,280
really the leading figures

588
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,919
in uh online governance and and content

589
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:16,799
moderation

590
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,480
and one thing i love about the trust and

591
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,720
safety professionals association

592
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,559
when i asked them what about the

593
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,400
employees of some outsourcers that we

594
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:24,880
use

595
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,360
for you know low complexity low harm

596
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,240
reports

597
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
can they come to your meetings and they

598
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,679
said absolutely if you have outsourcers

599
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,320
in

600
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,240
different countries we're working on you

601
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,760
know trust and safety matters for

602
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,200
discord they are welcome

603
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,039
at our events just as your employees

604
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,120
would be and i think that's great that's

605
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,720
in the spirit of we all need to

606
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:46,000
to get better at this um i would say

607
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,760
one area where we don't have enough

608
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,200
contacts is

609
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,960
academics and civil society groups

610
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,880
outside north america so

611
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
one reason i'm here at wright's con and

612
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,840
and discord as a sponsor of rightscon is

613
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,000
we're eager to make connections with

614
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,640
civil society groups and academics

615
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,559
outside north america we have so much to

616
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,320
learn from the work you're doing

617
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
and uh we're committed to that and being

618
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,600
here is part of that

619
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:16,320
thank you so much so um

620
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,840
it's great that you mentioned the

621
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,960
participation of academics because um

622
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,919
uh you know cooperation with tech

623
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,559
corporations is very good but

624
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:30,159
also we would be delighted

625
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:32,559
if you come up with your own creative

626
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,520
methods for

627
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,480
governance and uh and kind of like

628
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,880
improve upon them which i can see that

629
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,240
at this point that

630
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:44,159
is about to happen but um

631
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,760
so there is a word that we use now that

632
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,520
we are talking about stakeholders there

633
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,360
is a word that we use

634
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
at writescon and other venues and

635
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
it's it's called like multi-stakeholder

636
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,559
governance um it's a governance system

637
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:05,200
it has uh in my opinion it has kind of

638
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:05,679
lost

639
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,960
its meaning and

640
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
and while we have disagreements over the

641
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:14,000
definition as well

642
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,960
do you find the meaning do you find this

643
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,919
multi-stakeholder governance

644
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,120
meaningful um do you think

645
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,400
there is a way out of like this complex

646
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:29,440
definition can you change our mind about

647
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,760
go to stakeholders what are your plans

648
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,799
to just include all of these

649
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,880
stakeholders that have conflicting

650
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,440
opinions and make the world better

651
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,640
yeah i'm glad you raised this and and i

652
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:43,760
would say first off

653
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,720
you know you understand this topic much

654
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,320
better than i do and you

655
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,880
are an expert in in you know uh

656
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,880
multi-stakeholder systems and and

657
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,559
how they've worked and how they failed

658
00:22:56,559 --> 00:22:58,480
so so i won't profess to be

659
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:01,520
an expert there uh where i come from

660
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,640
is a multi-stakeholder approach is is

661
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,840
central to the role

662
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,000
of a chief legal officer of a tech

663
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,760
company when you think about it

664
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,400
you know i have stockholders who've

665
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,240
invested in my company

666
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,559
i have employees i have members of the

667
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:17,760
management team

668
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,600
i have you know users of our product

669
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,240
i have sponsoring corporations in our

670
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,240
case like a sony or spotify who

671
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,559
integrate with our product

672
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,799
and then i have uh outside groups like

673
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,480
you know regulators

674
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,840
in different countries who care about

675
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,760
what we're doing so in effect you know

676
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,559
my job is

677
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,960
is a multi-stakeholder process uh every

678
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,880
day at work i'm thinking about

679
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,840
um how are we serving the employees how

680
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,279
are we serving our users

681
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,200
how are we being mindful of the

682
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
regulators

683
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,039
how can we help you know a professor at

684
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,039
carnegie mellon advance her research

685
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,400
and so by definition it's a

686
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:56,960
multi-stakeholder

687
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,400
role so when i think about

688
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:01,039
multi-stakeholder

689
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,080
organizations i really hope they can be

690
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,440
successful and i hope they can be

691
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,880
structured in a way

692
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
so that all the relevant uh groups have

693
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:10,960
voices and have

694
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:14,720
impact and the way i think about it

695
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,520
is not that you know it's a binary it's

696
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,159
it's

697
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,720
failed or it's succeeded it's really a

698
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:21,440
question for

699
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:25,279
for us as participants in this movement

700
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:27,919
to ask with each of our decisions with

701
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,440
each of our actions

702
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,480
are we advancing a multi-stakeholder

703
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,039
approach

704
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:35,760
are we detracting from it so so when we

705
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,320
create an

706
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,640
organization when we organize a

707
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,520
conference

708
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,200
when we decide where to spend our money

709
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,720
and where to spend our time

710
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,200
are we advancing a multi-stakeholder

711
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,000
approach are we

712
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,559
cutting people out um and so that's the

713
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,960
way i approach it so so each day

714
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,559
uh i look for opportunities to embrace

715
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,840
a multi-stakeholder uh ethos and i think

716
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,679
by joining events like this you know i

717
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:00,640
could be

718
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,640
reading a patent or i could be writing a

719
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,080
stock document

720
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,799
but i'm here at writescon and meeting

721
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,600
people

722
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,000
and i think that's endorsement of of the

723
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,520
multi-stakeholder approach

724
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,279
so i don't think we should give up on it

725
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,559
i think there's promise there and

726
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:16,240
there's not just promise i think it's

727
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,120
something that if

728
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,279
we work at we can help it fulfill its

729
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,279
potential

730
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,000
okay wonderful so we have received some

731
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,159
questions but i'm going to

732
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:29,039
ask you this last question that i have

733
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:29,600
and

734
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,799
uh then we can go to the uh audience so

735
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:36,480
imagine a world without facebook

736
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,679
or any other apps nah imagine

737
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:42,080
discord was the only tech platform that

738
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,279
people were

739
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,640
uh using in the world and um

740
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:52,159
so how do you how can you imagine your

741
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:54,640
role in that imagine you were a monopoly

742
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
what would you do

743
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
that might be the most interesting

744
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,520
question i've had in in many years uh

745
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,000
let me think about that well so as a as

746
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,600
a starting place

747
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:09,600
i'm a little bit sad because at least

748
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,679
within my own family

749
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,320
you know on a given day we'll laugh

750
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:15,039
looking at some

751
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,520
tick tock videos or if there's important

752
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,480
news we're following it on twitter

753
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,880
and i think the different apps we use

754
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,000
they're all useful

755
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,000
for something different and discord is

756
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,600
great for connecting with the people and

757
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,360
communities you care about

758
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,919
but it's not a news reader you know and

759
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:32,480
and so

760
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,200
so i i think one i'd partly be sad

761
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:35,760
because

762
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,080
uh there's so many rich apps out there

763
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,919
that are innovating each week and and

764
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:40,880
making our

765
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,159
you know life more more meaningful uh

766
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:47,679
but if it had to be discord um

767
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:49,360
i guess i'm i'm thankful for certain

768
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,760
things about discord the product

769
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,240
i'm thankful that we have you know chat

770
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,320
voice and video and you get to decide

771
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,679
which one to use

772
00:26:57,679 --> 00:27:00,000
uh i'm thankful that it's good for

773
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,440
one-on-one conversations

774
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,000
and it's good for you know a hundred

775
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
thousand people to come together for an

776
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,520
event i'm glad that we're cross-platform

777
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:12,880
and so we really aim to be useful on

778
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,880
on every device and on every operating

779
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,840
system i'm glad that we invest in

780
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
supporting multiple languages and

781
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:21,520
accessibility for people who are

782
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:24,000
vision impaired and hearing impaired and

783
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,039
so

784
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:26,640
i guess i'm glad that if there has to be

785
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:29,919
one app it's discord

786
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:33,600
because i think we offer uh a lot

787
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,640
that is uh you know positive for

788
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,320
for bringing belonging and community to

789
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,919
the world um

790
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:42,240
i guess to your point of you know the

791
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:43,760
monopoly

792
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
it's a fascinating jumping off point for

793
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,600
for the

794
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:50,399
connection between content moderation

795
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:50,720
and

796
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,399
competition law and i think that's

797
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:57,600
such a rich area to explore

798
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,919
i think a lot about common carrier

799
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:00,799
regulation

800
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,960
at what point do these platforms become

801
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,159
so essential

802
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,480
they're like our electricity like our

803
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
water like our sewer system

804
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,520
uh and what does that mean for for us as

805
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,240
creators and users of these platforms

806
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,320
if if governments begin to see us as

807
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:18,320
common carriers will there be

808
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,440
less innovation will be less customer

809
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,159
service

810
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,480
will there be tighter alignment between

811
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,320
the regulated common carrier and the

812
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,279
government

813
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,399
uh will there be a level of conservatism

814
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:31,679
that doesn't exist

815
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:34,559
uh today in the management uh of these

816
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:35,520
utilities

817
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,840
and so uh it's a good jumping off point

818
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,279
there are people who are

819
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,279
uh much brighter minds than mine

820
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,039
grappling with this issue

821
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,799
of uh you know common carrier regulation

822
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,320
and and what that would mean but i think

823
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,039
it's a fascinating topic

824
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:54,559
um just to pick on that a little bit um

825
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,440
so what would you do because you'd be

826
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,000
the most

827
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,080
powerful and you wouldn't not have any

828
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,200
competition

829
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,520
are you uh what how are you gonna treat

830
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:05,440
these stakeholders because now you're

831
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,120
here and uh we have a role in

832
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,600
making your life a bit difficult or

833
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,320
easier

834
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,080
and it's great that you're here but how

835
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,720
are you gonna go what is going to be

836
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,279
the approach towards this external

837
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,880
stakeholders

838
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,080
yeah i the stakeholder

839
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:27,520
uh relationships would be of

840
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:30,000
of the highest importance uh but so with

841
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:30,559
the

842
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:33,200
the user relationships and so listening

843
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:34,799
to our users in terms of

844
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,600
of what they wanted from us uh would be

845
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:38,640
incredibly important

846
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,679
because we would have the obligation uh

847
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:44,399
to serve them no matter what and so i

848
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,600
think

849
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,039
that that would be our focus

850
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,279
um okay let's go to the audience

851
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,039
question one of the questions asked that

852
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:59,520
does the proactive what does the

853
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,120
proactive moderation

854
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,399
by the trust and safety team look like

855
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,720
does this court use tools to review

856
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:09,200
posts pre-upload or

857
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,320
post upload is this um

858
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,320
machine learning assistant and this is a

859
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
very important question that in our

860
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,440
community we are

861
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,960
very worried about about automation

862
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:24,880
of takedowns as well as upload filters

863
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,760
so um this is a very very good question

864
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:28,799
that can be

865
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,320
challenging yeah yeah i'm

866
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,720
glad this question came in because uh

867
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,159
our proactive work

868
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:38,080
uh first it's primarily focused on the

869
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,919
highest harm areas so

870
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,520
it's focused on you know violent

871
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,760
extremism and and sexual exploitation

872
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,320
it is based on machine learning and that

873
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,600
you know we use machine learning

874
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,640
algorithms

875
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,760
to detect possibly troubling activity

876
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,919
but then it results in human review so

877
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,000
so we aren't automatically taking

878
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,320
action based upon the machine learning

879
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,039
results

880
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,159
it almost comes up with a a queue

881
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:07,760
of communities or individuals that

882
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:09,360
require further

883
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,440
assessment by a human and those are

884
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,840
humans working at discord

885
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,279
not outsourced employees they're humans

886
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,440
on my trust and safety team who follow

887
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,399
up on

888
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:24,320
the lead so to speak that were generated

889
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,840
by the machine learning algorithm

890
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
so if you look at our transparency

891
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,840
report from from last fall

892
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,679
i was really pleased to see that on

893
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:33,840
violent extremism we were taking down

894
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,919
two times as many communities with

895
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,360
proactive measures

896
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,440
than with reactive and and that was a

897
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,799
real source of pride for

898
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,760
for our team that the machine learning

899
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,200
detected an issue

900
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,440
we investigated and confirmed that it

901
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,080
was an extremist group or a hate group

902
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,600
and we removed the community from

903
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:53,760
discord proactively before anyone

904
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,640
complained

905
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,240
and that was a source of pride for us

906
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,000
that you know hate has no

907
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,919
place on discord and if we can find it

908
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:01,519
before someone reports it

909
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:03,600
that's even better but yes there's

910
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:04,880
machine learning but it's always

911
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:05,760
combined

912
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,240
with human review to understand the

913
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,440
context

914
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,200
the machine learning for instance

915
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,559
sometimes will find something that is

916
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:13,760
satire

917
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,000
and the human will realize aha you know

918
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,760
they're making fun of

919
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,760
a certain group we're not going to

920
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,279
delete it but we might give them some

921
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:22,880
advice to tone it down

922
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,559
so that they don't get detected next

923
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:28,399
time by the machine learning

924
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:31,600
uh that's great uh so

925
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,679
this goes back to how you actually

926
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:35,120
define

927
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,000
um trust and safety to terms that

928
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:43,360
are very loaded in a way but

929
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,039
and um but also

930
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,960
when you talk about machine learning and

931
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,519
we discuss a lot the concept of fairness

932
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:58,880
and how do you how do you

933
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,080
manage to do you define fairness

934
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,360
in your machine learning if you use

935
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,720
machine learning do you

936
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,919
define furnace before actually add the

937
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:12,080
design of the product

938
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,640
itself so at this

939
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,799
point in time we're using very general

940
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,480
machine learning algorithms you know

941
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,919
primarily open source

942
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:24,720
algorithms to spot things that could be

943
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:26,000
problematic

944
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,640
we still very much engage in inhuman

945
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,360
review

946
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
by our trust and safety team because

947
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,880
context is so important

948
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,640
there's so many situations that we

949
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,559
debate within our own trust and safety

950
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:37,200
team

951
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,760
because the context is nuanced and

952
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,240
one reason we want to engage more with

953
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,399
civil society groups and academics is to

954
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,200
bring

955
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,640
more nuance to those decisions and so

956
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,360
people should know that on the the

957
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,200
delicate decisions we make they're being

958
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,679
made by humans and those humans are

959
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,760
you know studying academic literature

960
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,240
getting training through industry

961
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,480
organizations

962
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:03,760
and really trying to make the best

963
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:06,000
judgment in the moment based on all

964
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:09,360
the context that they can capture

965
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,879
um so i'm going to ask a difficult

966
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:13,599
question

967
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,359
and i know it's difficult and there's

968
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,280
never

969
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,399
one answer to it and when you talk about

970
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,159
stakeholder engagement

971
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,320
uh sometimes in some type corporations

972
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,440
we see that they

973
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
can choose who they want to

974
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,320
because of course the volume of when you

975
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,480
issue a public comment if like there's

976
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,399
like 3 000

977
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:39,119
comments and you don't know how to

978
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,719
actually manage them you don't have the

979
00:34:40,719 --> 00:34:42,159
resources but

980
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:45,359
when you oh how do you have

981
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:49,119
a way that we can make it better

982
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:51,040
so that you don't pick and choose with

983
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:52,320
which uh

984
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,359
com rich academics and civil society

985
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,280
organizations you go to

986
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,960
and be more inclusive

987
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,240
yeah we would love guidance on this so

988
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,079
you know we are so small right now

989
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:08,960
we are 350 employees i mentioned we're

990
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,160
almost all

991
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,640
in north america we're at the very early

992
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
stages of this company

993
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,119
we want to do it right we want to take

994
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:18,960
multi-stakeholder feedback into the

995
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:19,599
decisions

996
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,000
we make so you know we invite people to

997
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,839
tell us how to do it right we haven't

998
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,680
had the problem yet of of picking and

999
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:26,640
choosing because

1000
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,280
we have so few external relationships

1001
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,079
and so

1002
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:32,480
we want to build those relationships uh

1003
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,520
one thing we can do

1004
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:36,640
is we know there certain uh you know

1005
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,440
parts of the world certain vulnerable

1006
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,760
communities that can be targeted

1007
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:44,160
that are finding that discord is a good

1008
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,280
place to

1009
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,760
join and build community and communicate

1010
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,200
and so maybe that's one way we start

1011
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,040
filtering is saying oh we have a very

1012
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,280
active group of users in this country

1013
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,400
or we have a you know thriving set of

1014
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,480
communities from this one

1015
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,960
group that's vulnerable let's focus

1016
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:01,680
there

1017
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,760
so to the extent we focus i think we'll

1018
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,560
follow the lead of our users and say

1019
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,960
where are our users where are they from

1020
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,960
what communities do they represent

1021
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,960
and let's make sure we're building

1022
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
relationships with stakeholders that are

1023
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,720
strong representatives of those

1024
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,800
communities who are finding

1025
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,320
uh belonging and meaning on discord

1026
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:26,240
that's a very good segue to another um

1027
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,880
participant question which is very

1028
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:29,839
important

1029
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,880
and normally in our

1030
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,839
discussions with tech corporations they

1031
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:36,320
focus

1032
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,079
a lot on taking down

1033
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:43,440
and penalty and uh

1034
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,320
and you know this this is their solution

1035
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:46,720
to

1036
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,079
the problem of to the behavioral problem

1037
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:50,640
that

1038
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:54,480
um they face on their platform and some

1039
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,720
of

1040
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:57,040
us don't think that is enough um the

1041
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,280
question is

1042
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:02,160
so when you mitigate harm what do you do

1043
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:08,240
actually for repairing harms

1044
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,440
that's that is a an important topic

1045
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:13,760
and it's one where i think the the

1046
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,920
community moderators will often be more

1047
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:16,880
skilled

1048
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,240
than the discord staff because the

1049
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,839
discord staff that might be making a

1050
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:22,720
decision

1051
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,640
they're not a member of the community

1052
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,520
that has experienced the harm

1053
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:29,839
whereas the community moderators who are

1054
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:31,760
inside that community

1055
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,520
have probably you know witnessed and

1056
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,280
seen the effects of that harm

1057
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,920
and are in a better position to to

1058
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,320
provide the healing

1059
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,560
we do you know give a lot of thought to

1060
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,920
this question of

1061
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,240
when are the scenarios that an outright

1062
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,040
ban

1063
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,720
is necessary you know behavior is

1064
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,640
so troubling and so offensive and so

1065
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,839
harmful that

1066
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:56,480
we will go to great technical means to

1067
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,320
make sure that person never registers

1068
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
again for discord

1069
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,440
no matter you know what device they're

1070
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,960
on no matter what

1071
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,640
know email or phone number they use we

1072
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
will try to keep them off our platform

1073
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
there are certain things you know around

1074
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,839
sexual exploitation or non-consensual

1075
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:13,920
pornography where they're so offensive

1076
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:14,960
and hateful

1077
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,760
we're going to stop it uh no matter what

1078
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,440
there are a lot of other scenarios where

1079
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,079
there's a chance for education we want

1080
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:23,040
to provide

1081
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,359
belonging in people's lives we want to

1082
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:26,960
provide communities where they can be

1083
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,480
accepted and understood and

1084
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,200
heard and if we think there's a scenario

1085
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,119
where someone can be pulled aside and

1086
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:34,720
warned and educated

1087
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:37,119
about what it means to be a positive

1088
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:39,200
force in a community

1089
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,480
we're going to look for that because

1090
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,920
fundamentally we want to bring people

1091
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,960
together

1092
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,359
and so we look for opportunities to find

1093
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,240
measures

1094
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,440
short of an outside ban when we believe

1095
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:50,240
someone can

1096
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,960
can be a good member of a community we

1097
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,520
want them back

1098
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,720
great so when we talk about like

1099
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,520
repairing

1100
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:03,920
harm we see the attacker but also

1101
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:07,920
we see the survivor um

1102
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,839
how do you what do you think the role of

1103
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,520
the survivor here is

1104
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,800
how can you like you know remedy the

1105
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,280
harm

1106
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,880
considering in putting and center the

1107
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,480
actual victim here yeah um

1108
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:25,680
so when you come back to the the product

1109
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,320
design

1110
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,640
you know putting the user first so that

1111
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,520
they can

1112
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,839
you know block people who have harmed

1113
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,960
them or block people who are allied

1114
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,760
with the someone who has harmed them uh

1115
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,240
second

1116
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,480
you know there are communities that you

1117
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,720
can join or leave and if you find that

1118
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,160
you know a community

1119
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,400
is aligned with someone who attacked you

1120
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:48,160
you know you leave that community and

1121
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:49,839
you start a positive one so so i do

1122
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:51,520
think it comes back to product design

1123
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,720
and and putting

1124
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:56,560
uh the person who has suffered the harm

1125
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,320
in charge of their experience on our

1126
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,560
platform in charge of who they engage

1127
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:00,880
with

1128
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:04,560
in in what mode and that's central to

1129
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:08,240
to making discord successful for them

1130
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,839
wonderful so i have a kind of long

1131
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:13,760
question that i would like to read it

1132
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,640
out because it's

1133
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,160
okay it's important so

1134
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,319
um they're asking at the beginning of

1135
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:23,440
the year i read how discord was helping

1136
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,000
the

1137
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,480
this channel wall street bits team

1138
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,200
moderate

1139
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:30,560
its server after temporarily banning the

1140
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:31,599
group

1141
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:33,680
curious if you've considered whether

1142
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,200
offloading cm

1143
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,800
to users content moderation to users

1144
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:41,200
increase the likelihood of rules

1145
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,040
violation

1146
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,599
and if it does um should companies take

1147
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:50,800
a proactive direct approach earlier

1148
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:54,000
in the game when the problematic content

1149
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:57,280
is reported and perhaps a bit of what

1150
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,400
what did you learn from that experience

1151
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,200
and which leads to the next question

1152
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,000
which is

1153
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,319
more user than other more users at

1154
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:07,040
discord

1155
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,839
is the plat platform capable of stepping

1156
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:10,240
in

1157
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,400
before the point a ban is necessary

1158
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,839
sorry too many questions i thought

1159
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,800
and uh uh and just to put things into

1160
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:21,520
context we

1161
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,160
we have 19 million communities on

1162
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,359
discord today

1163
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:28,560
for our 150 million active users

1164
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,599
so the idea that you know our staff will

1165
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:31,920
be

1166
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:35,200
moderating all 19 million communities

1167
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,319
is just not going to be feasible which

1168
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,240
is the power of communities you know

1169
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,160
moderating themselves

1170
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,520
until they need our help let me speak to

1171
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,800
wall street bats because that was

1172
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,240
fascinating and

1173
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,480
uh there was a lot of you know coverage

1174
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,280
in the media

1175
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:54,240
or statements by by politicians that uh

1176
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,280
were not accurate

1177
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,640
there was some excellent reporting from

1178
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,040
the verge so a shout out to

1179
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:00,640
our colleagues at the verge who i think

1180
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,400
got the story right

1181
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:06,079
but the wall street bets server had been

1182
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:09,359
uh warned multiple times for uh you know

1183
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:10,800
hateful speech that was not being

1184
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:11,680
moderated

1185
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:15,720
there was uh you know racist speech

1186
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:18,160
anti-lgbtqia speech and

1187
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,119
the server had been warned about uh this

1188
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,960
offensive content that violated our

1189
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:24,400
community guidelines

1190
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,000
and so when there was you know

1191
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:28,319
additional uh

1192
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:30,400
speech that violated this in february we

1193
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,839
took them offline

1194
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,000
uh this is all in the context of

1195
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,119
personal investing

1196
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,359
that is a wonderful topic to discuss on

1197
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:38,160
discord

1198
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,599
you know so many people care about

1199
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:41,200
personal investing so many people care

1200
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:41,680
about

1201
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,359
you know being involved in the stock

1202
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:45,599
market and and where to put their money

1203
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:47,119
uh that's the type of community that

1204
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:48,880
thrives on discord and we want it

1205
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:52,000
so what uh happened there was uh we

1206
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:54,480
worked with the forces in the community

1207
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,240
who wanted to do the right thing

1208
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,720
to relaunch like like a phoenix rising

1209
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,079
from the ashes

1210
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,560
uh wall street bets relaunched with

1211
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:04,000
moderation bots

1212
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,720
with proper roles and permissions with

1213
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,960
you know filters for offensive language

1214
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,040
and by just putting in a couple days of

1215
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,040
work by some you know heroic discord

1216
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,000
employees

1217
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,880
with some uh wall street bets organizers

1218
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:18,480
who want to do the right thing

1219
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,760
we think the community you know is back

1220
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,720
on good footing

1221
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,119
but to me that was a success story where

1222
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:26,079
we held our ground

1223
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,000
on our standards and our principles and

1224
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,200
we took it offline

1225
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:32,000
because they didn't respond to warnings

1226
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,960
but

1227
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,800
because there were people who wanted to

1228
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,319
bring the community back along

1229
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,200
proper rules and following our community

1230
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
guidelines we help them

1231
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,640
and now it's a thriving community so

1232
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:47,280
we can't have discord employees

1233
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,319
full-time

1234
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:50,880
moderating every community but when

1235
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,560
there's a useful topic like personal

1236
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,440
investing

1237
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:55,599
and people are finding value from that

1238
00:43:55,599 --> 00:43:57,040
community

1239
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
we can help them moderate it better and

1240
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
oftentimes that's helping them

1241
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,240
configure the community with the right

1242
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,920
bots and the right rules

1243
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:06,720
and the right roles and permissions to

1244
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:09,040
ensure future successful moderation of

1245
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,079
that community

1246
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,560
so uh there's a lot of press on a lot of

1247
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,800
topics relating to wall street bets but

1248
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:15,359
i think

1249
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:18,240
in our small part of the story uh we

1250
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,000
stuck by our principles

1251
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,880
uh and the server came down uh but

1252
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,400
because we're believers and

1253
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,000
people sharing information about

1254
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,560
personal investing uh we allowed

1255
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,520
uh a group to to reorganize restructure

1256
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:32,400
and come back

1257
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,480
in a way that's healthy great so

1258
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,319
um we we see that a lot of the

1259
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,400
um many products um and databases

1260
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,720
are built before these platforms become

1261
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:52,400
like large and as a result of a bad

1262
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,200
design we see a lot of consequences

1263
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:00,480
of you know later on when you have many

1264
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,480
many users which

1265
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:05,599
is going back to that question

1266
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:09,599
can you actually um are you are you

1267
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,520
uh in the long term are you looking at

1268
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,280
the long term what sort

1269
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:16,400
of uh effect your the design of your

1270
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,359
products might

1271
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:20,720
have and what are the um what are the

1272
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,240
reference what are you considering

1273
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:26,800
and and you're asking a question

1274
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,640
specifically around uh

1275
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:30,720
the user data we collect and and how

1276
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,040
it's stored

1277
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,079
yeah yeah yeah uh so

1278
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:39,280
uh you know our product is is designed

1279
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:39,760
to

1280
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:42,480
to scale and so i'm not sure we have to

1281
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,359
change

1282
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:45,599
our fundamental architecture as we grow

1283
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:48,800
from 150 million to 250 million to a

1284
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,440
billion users

1285
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,640
our expectation is the infrastructure

1286
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:56,079
and the architecture should stay the

1287
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,760
same

1288
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,720
at present all of our data is stored in

1289
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:01,839
the united states

1290
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,880
on a major cloud service and so that

1291
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:06,240
will be an interesting question

1292
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:09,440
as we continue to expand abroad

1293
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,040
the fact that a you know user

1294
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:16,480
in turkey who's communicating with a

1295
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:19,599
you know user in france uh those direct

1296
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:20,720
messages are stored

1297
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:24,000
in the united states will create uh

1298
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,040
interesting issues

1299
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,920
um but for now the data is stored in the

1300
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,400
cloud

1301
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,319
in the united states and that

1302
00:46:30,319 --> 00:46:31,839
architecture you know

1303
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:35,280
works for us and no no immediate plans

1304
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:37,920
to change that

1305
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,640
thank you so before i go to the next

1306
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:41,520
question i

1307
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,240
actually forgot to ask our community

1308
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,160
members in the beginning to actually put

1309
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,000
their questions in the chat

1310
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:51,599
it's a fireside conversation and so you

1311
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:51,920
are

1312
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,359
you should all be joining um so the next

1313
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,160
question but

1314
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,079
uh don't worry our community asks

1315
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:00,160
questions

1316
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:03,839
without me asking uh does this court

1317
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:04,640
engage with

1318
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:07,839
congress or state houses on tech

1319
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,160
issues like content moderation section

1320
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,359
230 or

1321
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:13,920
privacy if so what does discord think on

1322
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:15,200
those issues

1323
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,800
and if not do you plan to in the future

1324
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,040
yes it's absolutely important for

1325
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,240
discord to have

1326
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,880
a voice on public policy issues uh you

1327
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,480
know not just in washington

1328
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,480
but in all the countries in which we

1329
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,000
have users and and

1330
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:32,319
the opportunity to to advocate for them

1331
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,000
and their rights

1332
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,280
with respect to washington in particular

1333
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,359
we are strong proponents of a federal

1334
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:41,440
privacy law we think that

1335
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,920
the united states should have a strong

1336
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,440
consistent protection

1337
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,720
of personal data similar to

1338
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:51,119
gdpr of course there'd be some you know

1339
00:47:51,119 --> 00:47:52,960
us changes to it but we think

1340
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,440
uniform and strong rules modeled on a

1341
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,680
european standard or a positive thing

1342
00:47:57,680 --> 00:48:00,720
for our users and for our industry on

1343
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:01,920
section 230

1344
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:04,240
we're we're open-minded the law is 25

1345
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,200
years old

1346
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
we think it has enabled you know

1347
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,880
innovation and

1348
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,400
a you know huge amount of user benefit

1349
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,000
in terms of the technology that's been

1350
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,760
developed but we also acknowledge it's

1351
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:17,680
25 years old and then you know

1352
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,599
you wouldn't feel the safest in a 25

1353
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:21,760
year old car hurling down the highway

1354
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:24,880
uh so we are open to changes to

1355
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:28,000
section 230 uh that would modernize it

1356
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:30,240
and uh we're definitely part of of that

1357
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,920
process we're part of different

1358
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,559
uh coalition groups in in washington dc

1359
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,400
that that are looking at section 230

1360
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:39,119
reform absolutely

1361
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,720
oh wow you are advocating for a gdpr

1362
00:48:42,720 --> 00:48:46,079
style privacy federal law in the u.s

1363
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,480
that

1364
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,800
that makes our privacy activists very

1365
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,760
happy

1366
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,720
um because it can be a very um

1367
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:58,640
difficult law to actually implement but

1368
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:01,200
that's great yeah but come back to our

1369
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,680
our very first question in terms of the

1370
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,559
business model that differentiates us uh

1371
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,280
we don't

1372
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,760
make money from selling advertising we

1373
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,520
don't sell personal data

1374
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,079
uh if you know we're going to earn money

1375
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:15,760
we're going to earn money directly from

1376
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:16,000
our

1377
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,880
users in a transparent way where you get

1378
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,160
a b and c

1379
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,000
for this much money and we feel

1380
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,480
you know if we had a federal privacy law

1381
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:27,359
that

1382
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,520
gave people more trust that their

1383
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,079
digital privacy would be protected

1384
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,559
they'll spend more time using products

1385
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:35,440
like discord

1386
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,800
and that's a positive for us and so

1387
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,599
we would love a federal standard that

1388
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,839
generates more trust in products like

1389
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:44,240
ours

1390
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:45,839
and we also just want to drive home this

1391
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:49,119
point about our business model where

1392
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:51,599
the data we collect is used to provide

1393
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:52,800
you a better service

1394
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,800
but that data is not sold and it doesn't

1395
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,960
become part of your advertising profile

1396
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,960
that makes you the product uh rather

1397
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:00,800
than you know the communication service

1398
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:03,280
being the product

1399
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:06,480
uh just to pick on that um

1400
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,000
business model which is which is great

1401
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:11,359
not to use um

1402
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:14,720
the users as a product and as i said uh

1403
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:17,839
in the beginning i think this court has

1404
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,200
a community based uh vision uh other

1405
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:21,839
than that

1406
00:50:21,839 --> 00:50:24,800
just like solely on individual uh

1407
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,720
focusing on individual

1408
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:30,480
people however there is a

1409
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:33,200
there is a problem with the business

1410
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:33,920
model

1411
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,960
that has to charge

1412
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:40,160
um and we usually

1413
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,880
kind of disregard that but what if you

1414
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:44,640
want to go global

1415
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,280
you might not be able to provide your

1416
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,240
services

1417
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,960
if you charge to certain countries that

1418
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:51,359
can

1419
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:54,079
actually uh benefit like for example you

1420
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,960
bring them

1421
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,280
their understanding but you bring them

1422
00:50:57,280 --> 00:50:58,880
freedom of expression

1423
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:01,680
they can feel comfortable on discussing

1424
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
things on your

1425
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,839
uh platform uh so how do you actually

1426
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:07,280
balance that

1427
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,880
yeah yeah that to me is is one of our

1428
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,440
most

1429
00:51:11,440 --> 00:51:13,680
important obligations as members of the

1430
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:14,559
discord

1431
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,520
leadership team where we want to have a

1432
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,000
robust free product as we do today

1433
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,160
that has you know full capability around

1434
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,280
voice and video

1435
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,200
and creating a community and managing a

1436
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,880
community um

1437
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,400
at the same time you know we are a

1438
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:31,200
corporation and uh we do need to

1439
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:33,680
uh you know make money and pay our

1440
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:36,160
employees and continue to innovate and

1441
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:36,720
so

1442
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:38,720
the the magic will be you know finding

1443
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,079
those features

1444
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:43,119
that are you know are extras uh that

1445
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:44,319
don't take away from the core

1446
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:45,920
communications capability

1447
00:51:45,920 --> 00:51:48,640
uh but which some people will value and

1448
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:49,440
so

1449
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,960
um the the work uh

1450
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,680
will continue but some of the features

1451
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:57,440
we have so for instance

1452
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,839
you know maybe a larger file upload if

1453
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:01,839
you're really into digital photography

1454
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:03,920
and you want to share you know enormous

1455
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:05,839
images with your photographer friends on

1456
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:06,640
discord

1457
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,240
that has a real cost for discord in

1458
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,680
terms of our storage

1459
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,760
and our cloud bill so so for people like

1460
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:12,960
that if you're really into digital

1461
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,319
photography and you want to share your

1462
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,280
best images

1463
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,000
with a lot of your friends there may be

1464
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,559
a five dollar fee for large file uploads

1465
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:22,079
uh same thing if you really want to

1466
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:23,839
personalize your experience and have you

1467
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:24,319
know

1468
00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,640
uh a fun username and have you know

1469
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,920
custom emoji

1470
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,960
that are your you know personal emoji um

1471
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,559
or you're you know avatar changing um

1472
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,079
hey maybe you'll pay us five dollars a

1473
00:52:36,079 --> 00:52:38,079
month for that so so the things we

1474
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:38,960
charge for

1475
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,559
uh we think will be around

1476
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:43,200
personalization or some enhanced level

1477
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,040
of service for something like a digital

1478
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,240
photographer where

1479
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:48,400
you really need something extra that the

1480
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:49,520
regular user

1481
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,920
uh won't need so so that'll be our

1482
00:52:51,920 --> 00:52:53,040
challenge to find

1483
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,440
enough exciting features that people

1484
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,839
will pay for so that we can continue to

1485
00:52:57,839 --> 00:52:59,760
run the service continue to innovate and

1486
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,400
continue to add users around the world

1487
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,800
but we value the free users just as much

1488
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,680
as we do the ones who pay us

1489
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,920
right now that we are talking about

1490
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:13,680
privacy one last question as i promised

1491
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,319
so what do you do with encryption do you

1492
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:18,000
actually have any opinion

1493
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,319
about it or do you use it in your

1494
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,839
classroom

1495
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,359
i'm so glad this question came up

1496
00:53:23,359 --> 00:53:25,280
because this was one of the things that

1497
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:27,760
i wanted to cover today just to educate

1498
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:28,559
the audience

1499
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:31,520
so we have strong security on discord

1500
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:33,040
with respect to messages

1501
00:53:33,040 --> 00:53:35,680
in transit but you know messages on the

1502
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:36,720
platform are

1503
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:39,440
you know available in in clear text uh

1504
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:39,920
for

1505
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:41,920
you know our company and we don't have

1506
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,760
end-to-end encryption the way that many

1507
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:44,319
other

1508
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,839
uh products do and so if you are someone

1509
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:48,319
where

1510
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,520
secrecy is paramount if you're you know

1511
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:52,880
if your life or

1512
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,880
you know your your personal affairs are

1513
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,720
dependent upon you know absolute

1514
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:57,599
security

1515
00:53:57,599 --> 00:53:59,440
there are better products for you that

1516
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,119
have end-to-end encryption

1517
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:04,400
uh you know architected into them uh

1518
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,319
and you should be using those products

1519
00:54:06,319 --> 00:54:07,920
and so there's certainly cert

1520
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:09,680
you know certain circumstances in life

1521
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:12,319
where you need that absolute secrecy

1522
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,880
uh and discord doesn't provide that so

1523
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,960
uh there will be situations whether

1524
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,800
it's for our own trust and safety

1525
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,760
investigations or in response to

1526
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,040
a law enforcement request or government

1527
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,240
you know request

1528
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:27,920
that we will look at the plaintext of

1529
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,280
communication so

1530
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,040
uh we're about communities and bringing

1531
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:33,200
people together but we are not about

1532
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:35,200
absolute secrecy and so if that's your

1533
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,960
priority we're not the right

1534
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,559
communications tool for you great that

1535
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:41,680
was a very honest

1536
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,879
great answer thank you

1537
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:47,599
it's difficult to save my products some

1538
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,760
of you might not be able to use my

1539
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:52,880
product so thank you for that and

1540
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,599
uh we have there is this um very

1541
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,280
important question that i

1542
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,359
have been mentioning and you've covered

1543
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:00,319
most of it but i

1544
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:04,319
i do like to um get your opinion

1545
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,720
on it again so the audience is asking

1546
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:08,960
how do you address communities that use

1547
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,640
the platform to create

1548
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:14,079
harm for example white supremacists

1549
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,280
misogynists and those that engage in

1550
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,040
anti-semitism islamophobia

1551
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:22,480
to just use the platform to

1552
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:25,280
create cause pain for others yeah yeah

1553
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:26,160
you know

1554
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:29,280
we do not allow hate on discord our

1555
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,119
community guidelines you know

1556
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:35,599
clearly uh prohibit uh hateful messages

1557
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,839
hateful groups from organizing on

1558
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:38,880
discord

1559
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,319
and we put you know enormous resources

1560
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:44,240
at detecting these groups and and

1561
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,079
removing them and and detecting the

1562
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:48,319
messages and and removing them so

1563
00:55:48,319 --> 00:55:50,079
it really is one of our our highest

1564
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:51,359
priorities and

1565
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,480
uh we welcome working uh with experts in

1566
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:55,280
the community

1567
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:57,119
who can help us identify these groups

1568
00:55:57,119 --> 00:55:58,799
before they create harm

1569
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:00,720
so so one program i wanted to mention

1570
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,960
that is just getting off the ground is

1571
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:04,720
our trusted reporter program

1572
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,319
so you're if you're an expert at

1573
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,760
tracking hate groups

1574
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,240
if you're an expert at you know violent

1575
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,319
extremist groups and how they organize

1576
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:13,680
and where they organize

1577
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:16,400
uh we welcome you to partner with us we

1578
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:18,480
have a trusted reporter program where

1579
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,079
when you identify that one of those

1580
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:22,640
groups is becoming active on discord

1581
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,880
we will put your report to the top of

1582
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:25,680
our queue

1583
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:28,319
and then treat it very quickly and very

1584
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:29,359
confidently

1585
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:31,440
because we know they're people who

1586
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:32,880
understand these groups better than we

1587
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,440
do

1588
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:35,359
and if you can help us identify them on

1589
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:37,440
discord we will remove them so

1590
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:40,079
we're actively enrolling trusted

1591
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:41,839
reporters who can help us find hate

1592
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:43,520
groups and extremist groups

1593
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:47,280
and get them off our platform i

1594
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,839
really don't want to because this

1595
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:50,480
question

1596
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,839
but then when you um when you talk about

1597
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:54,480
you're

1598
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,200
at the end of the session anyway but

1599
00:56:57,200 --> 00:56:58,160
when you talk about

1600
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,280
detecting these uh groups and they have

1601
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:02,000
different

1602
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:04,160
everybody had different definition for

1603
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:05,359
terrorism and

1604
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:08,559
hated speech um do you have any plan

1605
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:11,440
to kind of like bring it uh some kind of

1606
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:12,079
moderate

1607
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:15,040
approach that we don't see in other

1608
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,960
platforms

1609
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:20,559
yeah so the the best information on

1610
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:23,839
on this would be we just recently did

1611
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,720
a blog post uh written one by one of our

1612
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:28,880
best experts on our staff around

1613
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:31,920
extremism and hate groups and and how we

1614
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,319
define them and the actions we take so

1615
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:37,440
the the discord policy blog uh is is up

1616
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:38,240
and running

1617
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,559
and uh uh the first post was you know

1618
00:57:40,559 --> 00:57:42,559
welcome to the discord policy blog

1619
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:44,799
and the very next post was the work we

1620
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:45,839
do uh

1621
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:48,319
on hate groups and extremist groups and

1622
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:50,240
and the resources we bring to bear

1623
00:57:50,240 --> 00:57:51,599
to remove those groups from our

1624
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:54,480
platforms so um i have

1625
00:57:54,480 --> 00:57:56,000
such high respect for the group at

1626
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,319
discord that works on this and i think

1627
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:00,079
you know what they do is best described

1628
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:02,559
in in that blog post

1629
00:58:02,559 --> 00:58:05,680
okay so we have just a couple of minutes

1630
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,160
to the end of this session so i'm going

1631
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,040
