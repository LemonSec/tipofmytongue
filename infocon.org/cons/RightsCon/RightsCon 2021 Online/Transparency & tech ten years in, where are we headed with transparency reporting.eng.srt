00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,040
rightscon and our co-sponsor of this

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,559
event bsr

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,480
i want to thank you to for taking time

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,160
out of your day to join us to talk about

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,080
transparency reporting

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
ten years ago google released a public

9
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,240
report the first of its kind

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
detailing how they responded to

11
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,240
government's requests for user data

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,000
since then other companies have followed

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,720
suit accessnow launched our transparent

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,119
report in index in 2014

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,960
to compile these reports and highlight

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,600
trends and indexes noted over 70

17
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,960
companies worldwide releasing

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
transparency reports

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,520
however some challenges still remain

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
though transparency reporting has become

21
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,200
more common for tech companies

22
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,440
non-tech companies who increasingly use

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,640
and hold our data

24
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,879
have not called onto the practice and

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,640
within the tech sector fewer companies

26
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:53,280
have been consistently releasing reports

27
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,960
the larger picture of reporting also

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,039
presents important questions

29
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:59,359
over the last 10 years has transparency

30
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:01,199
reporting truly been effective in

31
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,359
holding government surveillance in check

32
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,519
and how is reported aided in trust

33
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,200
building between companies and their

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
users

35
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,479
the goal of this event is to reflect on

36
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:12,080
these questions and more

37
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,920
to note gaps you need to be filled and

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,119
to look ahead to the future of

39
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,880
transparency reporting

40
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,400
we're grateful to the wide range of

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,000
speakers who have joined us today to

42
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,680
address these topics

43
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,360
as you can see we have a very packed

44
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,280
agenda for the next 19 minutes

45
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:26,560
and we encourage you to keep a

46
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,040
conversation going after the event

47
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,720
please feel free to share your questions

48
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,320
for our speakers in the chats

49
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,159
and we'll try to get to them at the end

50
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,400
of the q a section

51
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
it's now my pleasure to welcome nicole

to join us today to talk about the early

57
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,960
stages of transparency reporting

58
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,240
thank you etc and thank you to access

59
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,680
now and

60
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,920
to bsr for co-sponsoring this important

61
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,759
and timely event

62
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,680
nicole and i have worked together

63
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,479
for nearly a decade and we have had long

64
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:07,200
winding

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,959
discussions about technology and human

66
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,080
rights and we have also had

67
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:14,879
brief and urgent discussions on matters

68
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,800
of freedom expression and privacy

69
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,640
across the world so we'll try to

70
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,840
condense

71
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,720
those two types of discussions into a

72
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,280
fireside chat in just a few minutes

73
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,120
and we hope it sets the stage for a

74
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,640
deeper discussion

75
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,800
over the over the next 90 minutes so

76
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,280
thank you again to access and bsr

77
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,920
so let's begin nicole i think it would

78
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,760
be helpful if you give us

79
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,560
more background um on yourself and your

80
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,280
role

81
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,440
uh you're the head of global business

82
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,200
and human rights at a major technology

83
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,560
and media company

84
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,959
um and then if you can set the stage and

85
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,560
give us context

86
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,680
on how your role uh interacts with the

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
concept of transparency and why it's

88
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,599
important to the company

89
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,599
yeah so thank you to access and also to

90
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,959
bsr for having us

91
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
and um thanks michael i'm looking

92
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,560
forward to a conversation

93
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
with you today on these topics um

94
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,760
as you said i head up the business and

95
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,239
human rights program at verizon where

96
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,120
a dedicated team providing centralized

97
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,120
leadership and guidance on the ways our

98
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,519
core

99
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,800
business products services operations

100
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:23,840
strategy intersect with human rights

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,599
issues including issues like

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,680
privacy free expression the right to be

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,560
free from discrimination

104
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,440
and our efforts in our efforts were

105
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
building on a foundation for this work

106
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,920
that began at yahoo over a decade ago

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,040
which i know you know

108
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,400
a little bit about so while the core of

109
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,560
our approach to

110
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,560
managing addressing considering um

111
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,560
the human rights impacts of our business

112
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,239
hasn't changed all that much

113
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,760
in these last few years um

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,680
the issues that we're managing i think

115
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,040
it's fair to say have

116
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,799
considerably evolved and arguably become

117
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,480
more challenging and more complex and

118
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,439
i think the year 2020 of course has been

119
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:11,360
like no other in terms of highlighting

120
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,680
societal challenges and also the role of

121
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,120
technology

122
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,639
in our daily lives has been

123
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,720
perhaps never so evident and never so

124
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,680
important

125
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,400
as it is now so as a result of all of

126
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
this the responsible development and

127
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,280
deployment of technology

128
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,280
that takes account of human rights

129
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,960
considerations i think has become

130
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
increasingly paramount and so the

131
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,400
conversation that we're having today

132
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,479
about transparency reporting

133
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,280
um in this space i think is very timely

134
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:41,680
um

135
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,360
as well in in light of the fact that

136
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,600
we're coming up on the 10th anniversary

137
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,600
of the un guiding principles on business

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,000
and human rights the ungps

139
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,240
and you know despite that there's been i

140
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,080
think significant growth in

141
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,600
the business and human rights field

142
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,840
broadly over the past decade and that

143
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
connections in particular between tech

144
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,600
and human rights have become better

145
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,960
understood

146
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,080
um there's still room to go in

147
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,080
mainstreaming these topics across

148
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,960
business within organizations and more

149
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
broadly

150
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,600
and part of that is sharing information

151
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,199
communication and being

152
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,840
transparent so transparency reporting

153
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
being a critical part of that

154
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,880
it's sort of a unique time to be

155
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,039
discussing these issues in that wider

156
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,240
context

157
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,320
and of course michael you've worked with

158
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,080
companies with civil society with

159
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,120
governments

160
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,360
um in the field of tech and human rights

161
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,639
you know over this

162
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:37,680
last decade and and even beyond that so

163
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,840
maybe you could share a bit about your

164
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,360
background some of your

165
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,600
work and and give us your sense about

166
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,080
the origins of transparency reporting

167
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:46,560
and

168
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,600
you know how it's evolved over time

169
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,759
thank you nicole um and you've really

170
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,039
covered uh

171
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:54,639
kind of the present and the importance

172
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,240
and timeliness of this topic

173
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,680
now and i'll try to um rewind the clock

174
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,280
about 20 years to the early 2000s

175
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,000
and i guess i should begin by saying i

176
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,800
currently do

177
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,720
public policy advisory work for tech

178
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,319
companies and for civil society

179
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
organizations on

180
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,960
tech and human rights i teach as an

181
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,479
adjunct faculty member

182
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,319
at georgetown school of foreign service

183
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,479
and probably most

184
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,039
relevantly for this discussion i was at

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,720
yahoo for 10 years

186
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,319
and was a deputy general counsel i was

187
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:29,280
there from 2000 to 2010.

188
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,400
so the early and mid 2000s was really a

189
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,520
period of global

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,440
expansion for the technology companies

191
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,720
that existed at the time

192
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,520
so i would say principally yahoo

193
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,880
microsoft

194
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,000
google hardware companies like cisco

195
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:49,360
that led to what are some now well

196
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,120
documented challenges

197
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,240
in international markets including china

198
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,039
that in turn led to a call for a code of

199
00:06:57,039 --> 00:06:59,039
conduct around freedom of expression and

200
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,400
privacy

201
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,039
or intensive negotiations uh that

202
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:03,759
culminated

203
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,440
in the 2008 launch of the global network

204
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,360
initiative a multi-stakeholder

205
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,000
initiative made up of technology

206
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,919
companies civil society members

207
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,919
press freedom advocates socially

208
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:19,599
responsible investors and academics

209
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
and a cornerstone of the gni was and

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
is accountability

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,120
and a core component of accountability

212
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
is transparency

213
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,039
so if i could just offer one anecdote i

214
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,479
recall where i was

215
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,240
although not the exact date we were in

216
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,919
the offices of the center for democracy

217
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,560
and technology in early 2010

218
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,560
and a colleague from google approached

219
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,599
us in this small confidential kind of

220
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,120
trusted setting

221
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,879
and announced that google would be

222
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,319
issuing

223
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
a report it was not yet called a

224
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
transparency report but would be issuing

225
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,410
a report

226
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:02,960
[Music]

227
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
giving information on the law

228
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,960
enforcement demands

229
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,800
that google had received and it would

230
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,720
include information on numbers of

231
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:13,280
disclosures and types of disclosures

232
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:16,319
and i have to say at the time

233
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
given that i had worked closely and

234
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,000
regularly with

235
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
yahoo's global law enforcement team on

236
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,680
public safety

237
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,160
national security related issues and

238
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,280
speech and privacy

239
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,520
issues i was surprised

240
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,679
i thought it was bold and i have to

241
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,839
admit that there was concern

242
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,200
in the industry but i looked

243
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,719
10 years later and i think

244
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,360
that is the norm it's a standard across

245
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,080
industry

246
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,720
um if i can misuse kind of a public

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,800
policy concept

248
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,839
google essentially shifted the overton

249
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,320
window

250
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:58,160
and i should also note that there was

251
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,360
successful important advocacy by groups

252
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,440
like the electronic frontier foundation

253
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,560
cdt itself and others

254
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,880
who had pushed for transparency in

255
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,160
particular on the u.s

256
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,360
side um and google really um

257
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,360
took a bold step and what i um

258
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,760
i i want to kind of close that anecdote

259
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
by note in

260
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,959
there's a lot more work to do and and i

261
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,080
think we can

262
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,080
talk about that as as we continue the

263
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,440
discussion um

264
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,080
but i want to come back to you nicole

265
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:30,480
and

266
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,560
ask you about your role leading a

267
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,399
business and human rights program

268
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,760
and describing for us how transport

269
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
transparency reporting kind of fits

270
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
inside the company in the broader

271
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
kind of cons inside the broader concept

272
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
of transparency

273
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,399
yeah and i mean i think that the history

274
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,000
that you shared is so important to sort

275
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,519
of understand as we

276
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,760
you know consider where this fits within

277
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,880
um companies

278
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,320
you know where it's fit over time and

279
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,000
where it fits today

280
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,160
at verizon our work rests on a set of

281
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,600
key pillars and

282
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,320
one of those pillars is accountability

283
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,839
and transparency as you were

284
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,120
alluding to and i think you know we

285
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:10,880
in our company recognize that

286
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,440
transparency is an important way that we

287
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,040
can communicate about

288
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,040
how um how how governments are

289
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,920
impacting uh human rights through their

290
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,320
law

291
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,160
and through their policy and also about

292
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,440
the role of companies

293
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,160
and respecting human rights and it's for

294
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,440
that reason

295
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,680
or those reasons that our company has

296
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,200
placed a high priority

297
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,640
on transparency reporting for um

298
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
a long time now really since you know

299
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,800
the origins of this program

300
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,240
and all the way back to yahoo

301
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,440
and so to give a little bit of an

302
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,279
example i was sort of

303
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,959
thinking about you know the evolution

304
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,480
just within our company of these

305
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,760
practices and

306
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,399
when verizon media our tech and media

307
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,360
arm

308
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
was formed a couple of years ago

309
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
following yahoo's acquisition by verizon

310
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
um we had as a first priority really

311
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:04,880
among

312
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,959
you know what we were working on at the

313
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:09,440
time post acquisition to publish a new

314
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,360
transparency report

315
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,920
transparency reporting hub really for

316
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,680
verizon media that would house the

317
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,720
transparency

318
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,320
um reports and information for our

319
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,160
house of brands including brands like

320
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
yahoo and aol

321
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,839
and at the time we were really bringing

322
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,079
together a number of different

323
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,279
internet technology media brands and we

324
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,440
had this opportunity so we set out to

325
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,279
standardize reporting on government

326
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,959
requests for user data content

327
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,640
moderation

328
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,880
produce new and combined sets of

329
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,320
disclosures

330
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
that went beyond what any of our

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,320
individual brands had done before

332
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,120
and i think part of why we were you know

333
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,839
maybe

334
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,079
poised and able to take advantage of

335
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,079
that opportunity that came about and do

336
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,040
some advan

337
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,320
make some advancements in our

338
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
transparency reporting was

339
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,320
partially because we have a dedicated

340
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,000
team in place in our company who's

341
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,399
focused on these issues for

342
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,760
the duration of its existence um and was

343
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,920
able to step in at a time of significant

344
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
transition and transformation and

345
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,519
realize that transparency and

346
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,920
accountability are premium

347
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,519
in this work and that there should be

348
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
attention on those early on

349
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,920
but also you know that our team and our

350
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,839
company had been engaged on these issues

351
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,399
in discussion with external

352
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,480
you know partners groups organizations

353
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,079
so i was thinking back

354
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,320
when i first started at yahoo the first

355
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,360
conversation i

356
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
joined in the global network initiative

357
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,440
the multi-stakeholder

358
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,079
organization in this space was actually

359
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,480
around

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
practices in the transparency reporting

361
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,360
area

362
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,200
there was a new practice around

363
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
government

364
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
reporting on government requests for

365
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,800
content removal and at the time you know

366
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,000
that was sort of the next

367
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,360
generation um step from

368
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,240
the government uh request for user data

369
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,160
and what had been reported on those

370
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
and so it was an early conversation

371
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,360
about you know what was best practice

372
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:09,200
what was emerging like what could be

373
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,240
learned

374
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,839
um and those conversations in gni have

375
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:14,560
only been

376
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,320
you know rich over time and helped

377
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
inform our our practice

378
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,519
and of course we've also engaged with

379
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,600
other groups that have come up over

380
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,680
more recent years like ranking digital

381
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,040
rights that's looked at what is

382
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,880
meaningful transparency and how does

383
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,800
transparency impact

384
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,800
uh practice you know and how can you

385
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,959
think about that especially as a

386
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,560
someone who works on these issues within

387
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,000
the company that's been a useful

388
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,680
dialogue to be part of

389
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,120
and then of course we've had so many of

390
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,880
these type of discussions

391
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,120
um at access now's rights con over the

392
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,000
years

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,079
so you know really without this sort of

394
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,600
engagement um

395
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,920
i think the whole practice you know

396
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
wouldn't be as rich as it is today

397
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,800
so i know we're almost nearing our time

398
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,600
um

399
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,480
to wrap up michael what do you see can

400
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,480
you give us your forecast for the

401
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,160
challenges the opportunities

402
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,040
ahead you know look into the future and

403
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,279
tell us what's coming

404
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,680
um i'm not sure how far into the future

405
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,680
i can look but i will

406
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
note that i think the challenges and the

407
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,600
opportunities are really

408
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,600
one and the same and i thought that um

409
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,639
we could just spend a minute on on

410
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,040
three of the challenges slash

411
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,480
opportunities

412
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,279
the first is audience and i think it's

413
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
important to think about transparency

414
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,760
reporting

415
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:33,839
and have to step back and think about

416
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,120
who the audience is

417
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,600
for these reports but really for the

418
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,240
concept of transparency overall

419
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,760
it's consumers it's governments

420
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,920
it's academics it's civil society

421
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,279
organizations

422
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,480
um it's the press it's um

423
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,079
really it's all of those it's not a

424
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,519
single one

425
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,079
and that leads to kind of the second

426
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:57,839
area with where i think we have both

427
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,910
challenges and opportunities

428
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,279
[Music]

429
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,519
these are the most among the most

430
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:05,600
innovative companies in history

431
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:08,160
but i feel like from that first moment

432
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,760
when i heard about what became a

433
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,360
transparency report and when i

434
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:12,160
subsequently

435
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,320
saw it a few weeks later in 2010

436
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,399
there hasn't been sufficient innovation

437
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:22,160
there are some kind of companies that

438
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,560
are noteworthy in the user friendliness

439
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,240
and digestibility

440
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,079
of the transparency reports that they

441
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,160
publish and credit to them and i

442
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,720
hope that some of those steps become

443
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,160
more standardized

444
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,519
across industry in the u.s and outside

445
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,680
for certain but it feels like there's

446
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,959
much more room

447
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,360
on kind of understanding the various

448
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,079
audiences

449
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,320
and making a tool and the same way you

450
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,279
would design

451
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,920
you know a really useful and well used

452
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,720
product

453
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,639
um to think about transparent

454
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,199
transparency reporting in that way

455
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,639
the third challenge and opportunity

456
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,320
for the companies and i look forward to

457
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,480
the to the panel discussion

458
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
afterward is really around breadth and

459
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,920
depth

460
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,360
i think we need to think more

461
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,680
holistically about transparency as a

462
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,880
cornerstone

463
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,480
of accountability and not just

464
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,600
focus on law enforcement demands

465
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,160
whether in the u.s outside the u.s and

466
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
there can be more detail we need we need

467
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,880
that we need more detail the snowden

468
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,320
revelations

469
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,160
showed that sort of multi-stakeholder

470
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,440
advocacy

471
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,240
could lead to advances in transparency

472
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,959
reporting

473
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,120
but we need to think about it in the

474
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,000
same context

475
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,399
but i would give an example of diversity

476
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
equity and inclusion

477
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,480
and i don't mean just in hiring or in

478
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,920
the composition

479
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,120
of companies but in the design

480
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,320
development deployment of products dei

481
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,079
principles need to be a core part of

482
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,639
that

483
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,440
and we need to have companies sort of

484
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:55,920
think

485
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,839
holistically about how they're

486
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:58,959
transparent

487
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,880
with the entire community stakeholders

488
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,880
that i mentioned we need more

489
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,400
certainly on law enforcement more on

490
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,160
content moderation more on political ads

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
more on general consumer data collection

492
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,640
activities and you mentioned nicole

493
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
ranking digital rights

494
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,000
and that project and the indicators i

495
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:20,240
think um provide us all really a good

496
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,119
starting place

497
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:24,959
and and a road map um so

498
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:27,760
i'll kind of close by saying that google

499
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,480
did indeed

500
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,039
[Music]

501
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,200
move us forward it was a it was an

502
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,880
enormous leap and credit

503
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,080
to the company um but if i could for the

504
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:38,799
runners

505
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:41,919
kind of among us um

506
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:44,000
note it's been more like kind of a

507
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,039
corporate

508
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:48,160
walk or a corporate race um you know

509
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,600
leisurely moving steadily with a goal

510
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,240
but the stakes are too high and it feels

511
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,039
like we need

512
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:58,320
an olympian effort and um and i look

513
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,120
forward to

514
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:01,360
hearing the panel discussion and seeing

515
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,720

on their approaches to transparency

534
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,679
reporting

535
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,400

most often known as sasby so thanks so

541
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,120
much to accessnow for for allowing me a

542
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,000
few minutes to speak

543
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
here and plug an important research

544
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,679
project that's ongoing

545
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,919
at sasby so we are an independent

546
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,080
nonprofit standard setting organization

547
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,760
and we're dedicated to facilitating the

548
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,600
disclosure of financially impactful

549
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,440
environmental and social issues from

550
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,160
companies

551
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,600
to their investors we exist because we

552
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
believe that capital markets are a

553
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,799
critical level for for achieving a more

554
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
sustainable and just

555
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,559
future our standards are industry

556
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,240
specific and designed to capture a

557
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,240
subset of information

558
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,240
sustainability information that is most

559
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,320
likely to impact financial performance

560
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,600
of companies

561
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,679
and we are actively backed by a group of

562
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,520
investors with around 60 trillion

563
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,600
dollars in assets under management

564
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,240
and we are being our standards are being

565
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:38,960
used to

566
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:41,919
report by about 500 different companies

567
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:42,240
uh

568
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,039
across 70 different industries and that

569
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,640
growth is about 350

570
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,160
year on year so we're really excited by

571
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,919
the momentum we've achieved

572
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,480
as an organization in driving for more

573
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,000
comparable and complete

574
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,280
sustainability disclosure

575
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
this this audience understands why

576
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,120
transparency around things like data

577
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:03,039
privacy and content governance are

578
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:05,200
really important societally

579
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,200
but there's also this financial impact

580
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,039
angle and that's why sasby has gotten

581
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,960
involved so i thought i'd spend a moment

582
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:11,760
or two

583
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,039
speaking to that so the first line item

584
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:15,600
i would say

585
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,360
is on the revenue side and i think if we

586
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,679
think about content governance as

587
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,640
what users see on a given platform and

588
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,760
when

589
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,480
that really is critical to you know a

590
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,240
company's business strategy how they

591
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,320
attract and retain not just users

592
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,919
but also advertisers and that balance of

593
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,320
um

594
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,039
you know monitoring for harmful content

595
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,320
while protecting user freedom of

596
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,039
expression

597
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,720
we see different approaches and

598
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,400
strategies taken by different platforms

599
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,520
depending on the design

600
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,159
of their platform from the cost

601
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:46,880
perspective

602
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
uh of course we now know that thousands

603
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,400
if not tens of thousands of people

604
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,559
at various companies are are reviewing

605
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:53,600
content

606
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,520
uh and uh that's obviously it's a

607
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,200
significant form of investment uh the

608
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,360
other would be the capital expenditure

609
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
associated with automated flagging

610
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,200
systems using techniques like machine

611
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,000
learning

612
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,120
and the last thing i would mention on

613
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,240
the financial side would be the

614
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,919
regulatory piece

615
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:10,559
in that we we know that the u.s and the

616
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,760
european commission as well with the

617
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,000
digital services act

618
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,400
are mulling proposed changes that would

619
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
severely uh potentially impact

620
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,799
how companies not just moderate but also

621
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:22,720
kind of you know really show content to

622
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,760
users so

623
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,679
uh major implications there in terms of

624
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:26,960
you're thinking of this with an investor

625
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,200
lens in terms of risk return profile

626
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:32,000
you know how might a different company's

627
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,360
platform be impacted by different

628
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,400
regulations is

629
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,039
clearly clearly of interest so in terms

630
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,679
of transparency reporting

631
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:41,039
obviously they're critical for

632
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
accountability to a broad variety of

633
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,000
stakeholders but

634
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,200
also the metrics that have been

635
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,799
developed and are being used by number

636
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:48,080
of companies

637
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
on areas like content moderation are

638
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:52,640
also of interest to investors

639
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:55,200
so sasby standards actually already use

640
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,559
a number of transparency reporting

641
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,080
metrics so these include

642
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,640
information about law enforcement data

643
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,760
sharing as well as

644
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,960
content removal requests from

645
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,760
governments the next piece for sasby is

646
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,720
we are now

647
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,960
evaluating potential changes to our

648
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:09,919
standards to include

649
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,080
voluntary content moderation and content

650
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,360
governance themes

651
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,600
so really really eager to uh to hear

652
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,039
from companies and subject matter

653
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:17,919
experts

654
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,840
such as the people on the panel that's

655
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,960

00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,799
driven organization

659
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,159
in terms of understanding what are the

660
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:30,559
most important uh issues and the best

661
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,320
ways to be capturing uh

662
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000

663
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400

00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,400
pieces on our home page it's difficult

688
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,559
for me to know

689
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,360
what you watching this event are looking

690
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:36,480
for

691
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
and how therefore for us to improve

692
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,559
so please have a look and give us

693
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:43,440
feedback

694
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:46,480
on how to improve

695
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,400
both positives and negatives thanks

696
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,600
atelia company we say law enforcement

697
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,200
disclosure reporting

698
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,000
and not transparency report because we

699
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,600
do transparency

700
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,360
in all areas of sustainability

701
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,919
that might be children's rights or

702
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:06,880
environment

703
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,919
or our work in the supply chain

704
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:13,679
gender equality and so forth

705
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,840
and also on human rights impact

706
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,880
assessments the following

707
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
are the two starting points for the

708
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,360
companies reporting

709
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:26,960
first and foremost we encourage states

710
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:30,480
to be transparent themselves about their

711
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,440
use

712
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,559
and scope of surveillance we

713
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,720
welcome therefore the yearly

714
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,080
transparency reports

715
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,919
published by the governments in

716
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:45,840
such as sweden denmark finland

717
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,279
norway and lithuania so

718
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,000
please do encourage states to do

719
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,559
transparency reporting

720
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,240
to supplement those reports from states

721
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,679
our aim at taylor company is to

722
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,679
contribute to meaningful

723
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,000
and oversight and discussion

724
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,360
so we publish these reports twice a year

725
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,760
a full report with context and other

726
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,360
information

727
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:19,120
each march and then an update of the

728
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:22,960
law enforcement requests each october

729
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,200
and we've done so since 2013.

730
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,400
secondly as a side effect our work to be

731
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,320
transparent helps us

732
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,600
in getting things in order because when

733
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:36,400
we publish

734
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,520
information it needs to be correct

735
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:42,159
over the years we've added additional

736
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,360
transparency

737
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,080
to the actual statistics of law

738
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,880
enforcement

739
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:51,760
requests so in in addition to

740
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:53,760
our statistics statistics on the

741
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,559
day-to-day thousands of conventional

742
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,960
lawful intercept requests we also

743
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,240
provide information on

744
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,559
unconventional requests and the number

745
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,679
of such

746
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,080
that's about blocking shutdowns new

747
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,240
legislation etc

748
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,720
and how we have dealt with those

749
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,559
secondly we have added links

750
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:15,120
to laws providing states with direct

751
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,640
access

752
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,679
three we have also added links to laws

753
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:20,400
mandating

754
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,360
operators to do data retention for

755
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,760
surveillance

756
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,679
we have also added the links to the

757
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:29,919
government's own reporting

758
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
and we've added information on the

759
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,720
extent of use of

760
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,559
cell tower dumps and lots of context

761
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:42,240
and more so i invite you to have a look

762
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,000
into our latest march

763
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:47,520
uh 2020 report

764
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,799
one feature of telia companies reporting

765
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,520
which i don't know if other companies do

766
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,320
is that our figures are audited

767
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,039
just as our financials so deloitte look

768
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,880
into our

769
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:04,159
figures and also ask sometimes about

770
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,000
supporting documentation so that they

771
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,440
can audit our figures

772
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,720
so which are the main challenges as to

773
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,640
this reporting we have a chapter in our

774
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,600
march report

775
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,039
on challenges and omissions the biggest

776
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,080
challenge

777
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:23,520
notably is that the statistics on number

778
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,520
of surveillance requests

779
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
don't provide the full picture

780
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,760
governments also have direct

781
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,880
access real-time network access without

782
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,480
requests

783
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,720
regarding such direct access till a

784
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,880
company has no insight

785
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,240
into the extent of surveillance when who

786
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,760
and what and cannot provide statistics

787
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:48,799
what we can do as we do in our reporting

788
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,960
is to publish links to such relevant

789
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,000
laws in our respective markets

790
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,520
and as part of the global network

791
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,600
initiative the gni we address this

792
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,640
salient issue

793
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,080
of direct access another challenge

794
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,080
i wanted to mention here is that some

795
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,640
readers try to compare figures

796
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,919
between the countries several factors

797
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:10,960
make it

798
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,640
difficult to compare the statistics

799
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,399
between countries

800
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:16,080
thiele of course had have different

801
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,000
market shares in different markets

802
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,360
and also the working methods within the

803
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,240
authorities

804
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,960
differ and we don't know about their

805
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,840
priorities and working with us

806
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,960
so a very short summary thanks access

807
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:31,360
now

808
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,480
for arranging this important event

809
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,600
i myself look forward to

810
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:41,840
look at the stream on our reporting

811
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,399
first why we do it well our

812
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:45,520
responsibility

813
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:48,559
is to respect your privacy

814
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,640
but there are laws which mandate

815
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:56,159
us to hand over data for surveillance

816
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,440
what we can do is to be transparent

817
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:02,240
about that how many requests we get and

818
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:04,000
the context about

819
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
on such requests some things i

820
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:09,919
try to highlight in this intervention

821
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:10,880
one is that

822
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,000
clearly company statistics is audited

823
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,039
and also a main challenge

824
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:20,320
for transparency is direct access

825
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:24,000
where we cannot provide statistics so

826
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:27,279
do give us feedback positive negative

827
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,799
and on how we can improve uh my twitter

828
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:31,279
handle

829
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:35,840

831
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:42,640
thanks digital responsibility for

832
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:44,960
protecting user privacy

warm greetings from korea we are kakao's

835
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:51,760

and we are honored to be speaking to you

837
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
at writescon about our transparency

838
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:56,960
report

839
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,360
cacao makes a better world with people

840
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,799
and technology

841
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,440
as a mobile platform company the privacy

842
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,039
and protection of our users

843
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,919
is top priority our goal for the

844
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,520
transparency report

845
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
is to present a comprehensive data set

846
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,880
on the requests

847
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
and status of requests made by

848
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,399
government agencies for user information

849
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,320
this is one of the actions we take to

850
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,760
strengthen transparency

851
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,840
and ensuring the digital security of our

852
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,120
users

853
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,520
since 2012 we have been publishing the

854
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,039
transparency report

855
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:31,919
every six months here we see the

856
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:33,279
statistical data

857
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:35,039
that are included in the transparency

858
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:38,080
report for the first half of this year

859
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,640
we report the number of requests made by

860
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,480
the korean government regarding user

861
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,520
information

862
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,600
and the status of cases and accounts

863
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,440
duly processed

864
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,960
the type of information that the

865
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,559
government may request for

866
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,600
are as follows communication data

867
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,840
communication restricting measures

868
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,159
communication confirmation data

869
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:01,200
and search and seizure warrants cacao

870
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:02,799
does not process requests

871
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,640
for individual user information by

872
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,919
government agencies

873
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:08,880
without respecting official procedures

874
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,640
we make great efforts to increase

875
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,640
people's access to information

876
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,399
by improving the readability of our

877
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,000
content we present

878
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,640
clear explanations on the terms

879
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,679
standards

880
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,440
and procedures relevant to the

881
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
disclosure of user information

882
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,559
in simple language on our website the

883
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,080
transparency report

884
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:30,480
is a part of cacao's efforts to fulfill

885
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,720
our digital responsibility

886
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,440
first of all it is significant in terms

887
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:37,919
of the protection of user rights

888
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,880
it allows us to transparently report and

889
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,000
release data

890
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,519
on how we are handling government

891
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,320
requests for user information

892
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,679
secondly as cacao observes due processes

893
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:52,320
on requests by government agencies we

894
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:52,799
believe

895
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:55,120
that it is our responsibility entrusted

896
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,480
to us by users

897
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,320
to disclose such data in the

898
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,559
transparency report so that everyone may

899
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,000
view it

900
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,880
lastly kakao's transparency report not

901
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,960
only encompasses our endeavor to ensure

902
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,919
user rights

903
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:10,240
but it also expresses our pride in

904
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,919
keeping our users information

905
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,840
strictly guarded according to legal

906
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,360
procedures

907
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,760
in such a dynamic and unstable digital

908
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:18,640
environment

909
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,480
we make every effort to protect our

910
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,320
users rights and to fulfill our

911
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,200
corporate responsibilities and promises

912
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,440
committed to the promises we have made

913
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,200
cacao strives to provide

914
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,600
open and resourceful information for our

915
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,640
users

916
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,200
in light of the kovan 19 crisis we have

917
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,760
published the kakao kova 19 report

918
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,240
and aims to support the public with data

919
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:42,559
and to share the ongoing national and

920
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:44,559
global efforts in overcoming its

921
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:46,000
challenges

922
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,320
as korea's leading digital daily life

923
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,200
platform

924
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,919
cacao reveals analysis results on the

925
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:52,399
pre

926
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,799
and post-pandemic changes in user data

927
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,320
of cacao services

928
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,360
and the cacao coven 19 report please

929
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,399
contact our team

930
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:03,440
to learn more about our analyses let us

931
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,320
all safely

932
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,960
and wisely maneuver through these times

933
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,000
take care

934
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,039
thank you very much hi everyone

935
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,240
i'm uttara sivaram and i lead uber's

936
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,919
public policy work on privacy and

937
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:17,039
security

938
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,559
including the publication of our

939
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:20,799
government transparency report

940
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:23,200
first of all thank you to access now for

941
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,559
hosting this event

942
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,720
transparency reporting is incredibly

943
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,640
important to holding companies

944
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,159
and governments accountable and it's

945
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:32,000
good to take a step back and see how

946
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,600
this practice has grown

947
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:36,559
and evolved over the past decade uber

948
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,720
published its first transparency report

949
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,679
for a ride-sharing business in 2016

950
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,120
following in the footsteps of some of

951
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,200
the companies being featured today

952
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,120
but in addition to counting the requests

953
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,799
we received from law enforcement

954
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,960
our report was the first in the mobility

955
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,240
space to include

956
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,480
regulatory requests for data from

957
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,480
government agencies like the california

958
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,080
public utilities commission

959
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,919
and the new york city taxi and limousine

960
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:01,679
commission and that's because our

961
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:03,679
business is a little different

962
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,600
our technology connects riders and

963
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
drivers both online and in the real

964
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,320
world

965
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,320
a world that's regulated by agencies

966
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,399
overseeing things like transportation

967
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,800
energy and construction and the data

968
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
they usually ask us for involves uber

969
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:17,520
trips

970
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:20,480
where people go by using our platform

971
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,399
but even after names are excluded from

972
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:23,119
this data

973
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,199
this information still carries the risk

974
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,918
that passengers can be re-identified

975
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:29,760
by examining patterns of movement and

976
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,599
combining them with publicly available

977
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:32,719
information

978
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,639
for example if someone takes a ride to

979
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,480
the grocery store from their home

980
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:38,239
and the origin and destination of that

981
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,159
trip is disclosed to the government

982
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:41,839
it can be a simple matter of using the

983
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,079
yellow pages to identify who took that

984
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,119
trip

985
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:47,599
and that's why in every case we work

986
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,359
closely with government agencies to

987
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,040
understand the legal basis for their

988
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,839
request

989
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,679
and make sure we're not we're only

990
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,879
providing what is strictly necessary

991
00:34:56,879 --> 00:34:58,960
beyond that we use technical privacy

992
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:01,040
methods like coarsening the resolution

993
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,000
of location data

994
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
and time stamps to reduce the uniqueness

995
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,839
of every trip

996
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:07,760
by doing that we reduce the risk that

997
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,760
this information can be used to identify

998
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:10,079
our

999
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:12,960
users and in many cases regulators have

1000
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,400
altered their requirements in

1001
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,480
recognition of the privacy risks their

1002
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,880
requests can create

1003
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,040
by publishing this report and including

1004
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:23,200
requests from these types of agencies

1005
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,280
we want to stimulate a much needed

1006
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,359
conversation about government access to

1007
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:27,920
data

1008
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,520
both within and outside of law

1009
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,760
enforcement and for every year we've

1010
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
released our report

1011
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,960
we've seen a steady rise in the number

1012
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,160
of these requests

1013
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,240
as well as the number of users impacted

1014
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:40,160
as people turn to connected mobility

1015
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,800
options

1016
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,280
that they can access from their phone

1017
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,160
moving forward

1018
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,000
it's really important that we not only

1019
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,760
urge more companies to release

1020
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,440
transparency reports

1021
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,440
but also encourage a greater variety of

1022
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,880
companies to participate

1023
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,280
that's the only way to fully capture how

1024
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:57,119
data flows between the private and

1025
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,800
public sectors

1026
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,200
furthermore having a fuller picture of

1027
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,960
government data sharing across different

1028
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,760
sectors

1029
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,000
can help inform better and smarter

1030
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,800
regulation

1031
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,040
addressing how governments can and

1032
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,160
should access information about users

1033
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,880
we can all i'm sure envision a world

1034
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,000
that's powered by

1035
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,119
smart uh data-driven public policy

1036
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:20,880
as well as a user base that feels

1037
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:23,359
empowered and in control of their

1038
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,839
of their own data that's why in addition

1039
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,599
to publishing these reports

1040
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,520
we as an industry need to invest in

1041
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,880
solutions that leverage

1042
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:33,359
aggregated and anonymized data that can

1043
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:35,280
drive positive social outcomes

1044
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:38,000
without putting consumer privacy at risk

1045
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,920
there's a tremendous opportunity to

1046
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,520
learn from one another and improve

1047
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,960
transparency reporting

1048
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,880
and i know uber is eager to work with

1049
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,480
many of the companies and consumer

1050
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,800
advocates here today to accomplish that

1051
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,800
thank you and i'm happy to stay on

1052
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:55,839
afterwards for for any questions

1053
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,200
all right thanks everyone for

1054
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,520
joining us today um that concludes the

1055
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:10,880
the presentations and

1056
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,280
the videos so now we're going to go to

1057
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,000
the live

1058
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:17,599
content we've got an amazing panel

1059
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:20,720
of speakers here today and

1060
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,440
without further ado we'll get started

1061
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:26,160
i'd love to hear reactions to that we've

1062
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,400
heard from um speakers all over the

1063
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
world from a variety of types of

1064
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:30,960
companies

1065
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,960
um those who are you know around this

1066
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:35,359
process 10 years ago and before

1067
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,920
as well as those who've just started

1068
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,839
about half the folks on this panel

1069
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:42,640
work at organizations or companies that

1070
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:43,440
didn't exist

1071
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:46,720
10 years ago but we've grown with power

1072
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,000
comes responsibility

1073
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,320
with user growth comes abuse reports and

1074
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,240
disinformation campaigns

1075
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,000
search warrants and even executive

1076
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,359
orders

1077
00:37:55,359 --> 00:37:58,560
um in my perch at access now leading our

1078
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,079
business and human rights work and as

1079
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,359
general counsel

1080
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:03,520
um i've been able to watch this trend

1081
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,720
and i would argue that

1082
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,119
outside events even crises have driven

1083
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:08,560
reporting

1084
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,880
voluntary disclosures are not high on

1085
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,560
the list for most startups or even

1086
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,280
maturing

1087
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:15,920
tech companies looking at the access now

1088
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,920
transparency reporting index we see a

1089
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,839
bump of reports

1090
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:23,280
in around 2014-2015 i would argue that's

1091
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:24,640
due to the revelations of mass

1092
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,839
surveillance

1093
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,760
that edward snowden brought to the world

1094
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,240
civil society jumped on these moments

1095
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:34,320
and others in 2016 like the brexit

1096
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,760
campaign the 2016 u.s presidential vote

1097
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,000
as well as the me too movement to drive

1098
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,760
reporting on terms of service and

1099
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,280
community guideline enforcement

1100
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,920
as well as advertising transparency and

1101
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,680
i'd love for the panelists to refute my

1102
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,280
theses

1103
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,440
but i do think that most tech companies

1104
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:53,040
like other institutions

1105
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:55,440
know that transparency builds trust and

1106
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,640
can even help

1107
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:59,599
keep other stakeholders in check so

1108
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,560
we'll ask this

1109
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,280
panel what trends they're seeing in the

1110
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,640
coming years

1111
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:07,119
how we've gotten to where we are now and

1112
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:08,800
how all tech companies

1113
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,760
uh including you know any number of new

1114
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:12,720
sectors

1115
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:15,599
who exist now or who are coming online

1116
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:15,920
can

1117
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,880
better get her get ahead of their curve

1118
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:19,760
on reporting

1119
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,359
and respect the human rights of their

1120
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,200
communities so without

1121
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,119
further ado i think it's it's proper to

1122
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,440
go straight to

1123
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,560
to google to alex walden

1124
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,800
who is a veteran of the company now

1125
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,680
global

1126
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,400
head of human rights this is as we've

1127
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:37,920
heard the company that pioneered

1128
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,800
transparency reporting 10 years ago

1129
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:43,359
i'd love to ask alex why google started

1130
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,280
reporting um is there lore have you

1131
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:46,320
heard stories

1132
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:49,119
um but perhaps more importantly uh given

1133
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,240
the downtrend

1134
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,240
in some reports a lot of companies put

1135
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,839
out one and they're done

1136
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:58,240
um as well as the the rather notorious

1137
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,320
reputation at google to to start

1138
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,000
projects and then kill them

1139
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,240
um why has google continued and even

1140
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,920
expanded its reporting

1141
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:10,160
um thanks alex

1142
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,720
peter um and thank you to access now

1143
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,119
again for hosting this conversation

1144
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:17,359
human rights transparency and tech is

1145
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:19,040
near and dear to my heart and is really

1146
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,160
core to

1147
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,520
the work that i do at google

1148
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,839
um so why did we start doing

1149
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,079
transparency reporting

1150
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:30,240
if you rewind and some of this is what

1151
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,760
michael and

1152
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,760
nicole hit on but if you rewind back to

1153
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,839
the early 2000s that was really the

1154
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:37,440
early days of when companies started

1155
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,400
receiving

1156
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,079
government requests for user data

1157
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:41,599
government requests for information or

1158
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:42,960
to remove content

1159
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:45,599
um and so as we started to get these

1160
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:46,960
requests

1161
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:49,680
and push back on them we started to feel

1162
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,960
like they're

1163
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,040
it was an important principle for us to

1164
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:55,280
think about what it meant for us to be

1165
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,599
transparent with our users about both

1166
00:40:57,599 --> 00:40:59,200
what the company was doing

1167
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,200
and what governments were doing the

1168
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,960
interaction between the two

1169
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:06,079
uh and so you know over a decade ago

1170
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,599
we launched this effort to provide some

1171
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,599
of that information publicly

1172
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:14,960
then in september of 2010 it actually

1173
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,839
uh became itself a transparency report

1174
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:18,560
and for us

1175
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,280
we really do think it is about our users

1176
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,040
trust and it is also of course our

1177
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,400
commitment to human rights

1178
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,480
and both of those pieces are important

1179
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,640
to how we continue to think about it

1180
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,680
uh since then we have launched i think

1181
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:32,560
we are now

1182
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,760
at 12 different transparency reports so

1183
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,640
it is something that we remain committed

1184
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:39,200
to

1185
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,359
we started with user data we went to

1186
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:42,800
government requests for

1187
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,680
um removal of content and now we have

1188
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,520
reports on things like copyright

1189
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,480
we have think reports on things like um

1190
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:51,359
traffic

1191
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:54,880
uh internet traffic um regarding ads

1192
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:57,760
and um in 2018 we launched the youtube

1193
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:59,680
transparency report so we really

1194
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:03,280
have continued to iterate and expand on

1195
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,119
the breadth of areas of the business

1196
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:06,800
where we think it's important for

1197
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,200
us to share with users both how we're

1198
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,480
interacting with government

1199
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,800
and how we're enforcing our own policies

1200
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,960
against our products

1201
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,440
thanks alex yeah i think one area um as

1202
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,119
well that that google and others have

1203
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:22,800
started reporting is around uh

1204
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,040
demographics and staff data and i think

1205
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,800
uh building off michael samway's remarks

1206
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,839
maybe we can hear more about that

1207
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:32,160
um cool um i want to swing

1208
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,200
over to uh to reddit um actually we are

1209
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:37,839
going in in order of uh seniority here

1210
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:40,560
reddit uh was started in 2005. it's

1211
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,560
mature despite its image

1212
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,720
um it was started on the the east coast

1213
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:47,280
it's a social news aggregation and web

1214
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,200
content rating and discussion forum

1215
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,319
app and website uh with up to 52 million

1216
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,920
daily active users

1217
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:56,960
globally that's up a lot during covid

1218
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,119
and uh i think we want to hear from

1219
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:02,079
jessica xu the director of policy there

1220
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:05,599
about how their reporting has innovated

1221
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,680
over the past uh couple of years with

1222
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:09,440
reddit being really at the heart of

1223
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:11,040
social movements as well as the the

1224
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,960
covet 19 response

1225
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:16,160
um jessica welcome

1226
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,319
thank you absolutely happy to speak to

1227
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:19,760
those issues so reddit

1228
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,240
um issued its first transparency report

1229
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,359
in 2014

1230
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:26,160
in the bump of transparency reports that

1231
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,200
you just cited

1232
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
um we're proud that we've been doing

1233
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,119
them for so long and we're proud that

1234
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,160
um we've been expanding them um every

1235
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:34,800
year

1236
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:36,960
and also that we've been recognized as a

1237
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:38,800
leader in the transparency reporting

1238
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:40,000
space so for example

1239
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,000
we were the only company to receive a

1240
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,319
perfect score in the last eff who has

1241
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,000
your back evaluation of company

1242
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:46,960
transparency

1243
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:49,200
and so we really do think um deeply

1244
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,319
about this and

1245
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:52,880
it's important to us especially because

1246
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,560
of reddit's unique structure

1247
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:57,040
so we follow is your familiar community

1248
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,960
moderation model where the users

1249
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,880
themselves on a volunteer basis are

1250
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,160
highly involved

1251
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:05,280
in our content moderation operations

1252
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:07,839
so you know a statistic that is in our

1253
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:09,680
transparency report that we disclosed is

1254
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:10,640
that actually

1255
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:14,079
more than 99.7 of all

1256
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:16,319
content removals on reddit actually

1257
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:17,920
happen at the user level

1258
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:20,319
by these volunteer moderators and so

1259
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:21,520
because

1260
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,359
the users and the public really are

1261
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:24,800
partners with us in

1262
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
moderating the reddit platform it's

1263
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,079
really important that we

1264
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:30,240
disclose this data with them so that we

1265
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,280
can um

1266
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,839
have a healthy relationship where our

1267
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:34,960
policies are under

1268
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,920
interactions are understood um like

1269
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:40,560
other companies we used to focus only on

1270
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,599
government requests

1271
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,960
in our transparency disclosures um

1272
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:47,440
but as i mentioned before we've been

1273
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,359
expanding that out

1274
00:44:49,359 --> 00:44:52,400
and now it includes um reporting on

1275
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,720
content removal actions that we take as

1276
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:55,680
a company

1277
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,280
in line with our content policy

1278
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:02,000
um and that was a really kind of big

1279
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,680
expansion for us we've been doing that

1280
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:04,480
for the last

1281
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,119
two to three years now and it taught us

1282
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:08,079
a lot about

1283
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:11,599
um how to do transparency reporting

1284
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,480
and how to work cross-functionally with

1285
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:16,319
partners in the company to kind of get

1286
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:17,520
the data that you need

1287
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,599
and i think that this is one of the the

1288
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,920
biggest perceived barriers to

1289
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,079
companies doing transparency reports

1290
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,079
especially for smaller companies like

1291
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:26,800
reddit

1292
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,079
um you know we're only around 700

1293
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:33,839
total employees right now um but

1294
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,440
you know i think the biggest hurdle

1295
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:37,520
that's perceived to reporting something

1296
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,960
for the first time is making sure that

1297
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,640
you actually have the data

1298
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:42,240
tracked because of course if you don't

1299
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,400
track it you can't disclose it

1300
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,319
and so there's actually kind of a

1301
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,400
year-long ahead of time preparation

1302
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:50,000
process that needs to happen

1303
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,160
um before you do your transparency

1304
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,839
report because it may entail

1305
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:56,800
tooling adjustments which takes um

1306
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,720
engineering resources that are often

1307
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:01,440
pretty constrained at smaller companies

1308
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:04,480
but what i say when i'm talking to kind

1309
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:04,720
of

1310
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:07,040
my colleagues at smaller companies who

1311
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,520
are thinking of transparency reporting

1312
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,079
or they

1313
00:46:10,079 --> 00:46:11,680
want to do one but they don't think that

1314
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:13,440
they have the data or they don't think

1315
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:14,000
that they have the

1316
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,760
right data is that it's really really

1317
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
important not to let the perfect

1318
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,079
be the enemy of the good um because you

1319
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:22,480
know if you don't have a specific thing

1320
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:24,240
tracked or you don't have it tracked for

1321
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,200
the whole year

1322
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:26,720
you know you might have an approximate

1323
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,480
data point tract or

1324
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,160
you know you could report for the data

1325
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,680
that you have and then kind of start

1326
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:33,359
tracking it and do a full one

1327
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:35,760
next year it's important to think

1328
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,560
creatively

1329
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:39,520
about what's meaningful to disclose for

1330
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,280
your platform in particular

1331
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,440
because i think it's important that to

1332
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,760
recognize that a meaningful transparency

1333
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:46,400
report

1334
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:48,160
is going to be really different for

1335
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:50,319
every platform because we all represent

1336
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,359
kind of different

1337
00:46:51,359 --> 00:46:53,680
models and different services and

1338
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,480
products

1339
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:57,200
and that's okay and i know that that can

1340
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,319
sometimes be

1341
00:46:58,319 --> 00:47:00,720
frustrating for researchers and others

1342
00:47:00,720 --> 00:47:02,079
because they want to see

1343
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:05,200
um in apples to apples comparison

1344
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,960
of transparency reports across the

1345
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,040
industry but the reality is that these

1346
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,520
are not

1347
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,000
apples to apples services reddit is very

1348
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,520
different from google is very different

1349
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,720
from uber

1350
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:16,640
and our transparency reports each

1351
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,920
reflect that

1352
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,960
um and then kind of thoughts on

1353
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,400
continuing to expand

1354
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,359
transparency reporting and where the

1355
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:28,400
trends are going in the future i think

1356
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:31,359
it's very important to remember that

1357
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:32,240
transparency

1358
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,599
isn't just something that needs to

1359
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:35,920
happen once a year twice a year

1360
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,480
or quarterly or whatever your cadence is

1361
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:39,599
with with your

1362
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:41,680
reports um i think it's important to

1363
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:43,119
think about transparency

1364
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:45,920
as kind of a company value one of our

1365
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,800
values is default open

1366
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,559
and also think about how you can

1367
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,319
integrate transparency efforts into the

1368
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,359
things that you're doing

1369
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:55,920
all year and so for example you know

1370
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,760
2020 was a very particular year with

1371
00:47:57,760 --> 00:47:59,359
very particular challenges

1372
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:02,240
and one of those challenges was the

1373
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:04,240
racial justice reckoning in the united

1374
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:04,960
states

1375
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,839
and as a part of that national

1376
00:48:07,839 --> 00:48:09,680
conversation that we were having

1377
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,880
um reddit updated our content policy to

1378
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:15,680
more explicitly um prohibit hateful

1379
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,640
content

1380
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,559
um and when you're making a significant

1381
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:23,280
um content policy update like that it's

1382
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,960
really important to

1383
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:26,880
measure it and see if it's working and

1384
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,200
so you know while this might be

1385
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,880
a deep dive that's not kind of

1386
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,319
appropriate for the

1387
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:35,200
um format of the annual transparency

1388
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:35,760
report

1389
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:37,520
we really wanted to communicate with our

1390
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:39,359
users about what we were finding what we

1391
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:40,720
were seeing

1392
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,119
and so we created a dedicated subreddit

1393
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:44,000
where we

1394
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:46,160
talk about kind of interesting things

1395
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,920
that we want to disclose to the users

1396
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:48,480
but they

1397
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,720
might not be right or fit into the

1398
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,000
transparency report

1399
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,480
and so we discussed statistics um that

1400
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:55,760
we had found about

1401
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:58,319
how much hateful content we had found on

1402
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,559
reddit before and after the role change

1403
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,040
and we also discussed you know who was

1404
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,200
that hateful content targeted at

1405
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:06,800
and that's a really important point

1406
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:08,880
because one of the really great things

1407
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:10,800
about transparency reporting

1408
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:14,480
is that it helps you understand your own

1409
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,079
business better and there's a really

1410
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,000
strong business case to be made for

1411
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:19,839
doing transparency reporting

1412
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:22,400
because um i can now go to my trust and

1413
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,079
safety team and say we've got

1414
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:26,000
statistics here that say that most

1415
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,599
hateful content on reddit

1416
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:30,800
is involving racial issues and

1417
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:33,359
kind of less hateful content is

1418
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:34,240
involving kind of

1419
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,040
other types of issues so that gives our

1420
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:37,920
safety team

1421
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,599
a lot of really valuable insights about

1422
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:41,440
where they want to direct their efforts

1423
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:44,640
and so um there's a there's a powerful

1424
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,440
business case there um that you can make

1425
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:48,880
because it ultimately

1426
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,359
um saves some resources because we're

1427
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,640
not misdirecting

1428
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:54,559
and valuable engineering resources or

1429
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:56,480
valuable trust and safety resources to

1430
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:57,119
something

1431
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,720
that's not going to end up having a

1432
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,118
significant impact on the platform

1433
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,599
thank you yeah um so many great points

1434
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:06,480
there i think

1435
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,480
uh you know and you really pulled out

1436
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:09,839
your dependence on

1437
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,079
those i guess volunteer moderators

1438
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:13,680
they're not paid right and

1439
00:50:13,680 --> 00:50:17,280
with i think this was a necessity being

1440
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,040
the mother of invention you're you were

1441
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:20,880
a small company and i think you you

1442
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,240
still are relatively small

1443
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:25,839
despite these 50 million active users

1444
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:28,160
and i'd love to hear more also about

1445
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:30,480
your your global reach and so how do you

1446
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,319
ensure that these policies that you roll

1447
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,880
out

1448
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:35,839
are understood and are respected when

1449
00:50:35,839 --> 00:50:38,839
even when you're dependent on volunteer

1450
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:40,240
moderators

1451
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,559
yeah absolutely that's um it's a

1452
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,000
conversation that we're actively

1453
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:45,520
thinking about in the company

1454
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,359
um but i think what's great about kind

1455
00:50:47,359 --> 00:50:49,119
of the decentralized community

1456
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:50,559
moderation model

1457
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:52,960
is that it internationalizes and

1458
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,559
localizes a lot better than a

1459
00:50:54,559 --> 00:50:55,520
centralized

1460
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,880
um enforcement model

1461
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:00,800
because you know for example something

1462
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,240
like hate speech is

1463
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:05,359
hugely contextually dependent it's

1464
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:07,359
you know very sophisticated language it

1465
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,760
relies on slang it's often coded

1466
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:12,240
in the community moderators who are a

1467
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,920
part of that community

1468
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,559
are going to be able to recognize

1469
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:18,079
something much better than

1470
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:19,680
will be able to recognize it you know

1471
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,440
sitting in san francisco we're sitting

1472
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:22,000
in new york

1473
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,800
or wherever we are so um we've been

1474
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,160
focusing

1475
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,200
on having more intentional conversations

1476
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,040
with these moderators and kind of

1477
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,520
creating moderator councils really where

1478
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,480
we um

1479
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,480
speak you know directly over zoom with

1480
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,720
kind of groups of our moderators to just

1481
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:41,119
understand what they're seeing so that

1482
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:41,839
we can

1483
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:44,559
um better direct our resources to

1484
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:45,680
building things that are going to be

1485
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,280
meaningful for them for keeping their

1486
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,440
communities safe

1487
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,640
thank you yeah i imagine uh you'll get

1488
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,800
some up votes for that response

1489
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,319
um let's uh let's move to yeah the other

1490
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:00,559
uh company on our platform and i and on

1491
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:03,599
our panel and i am going to pri

1492
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:06,480
prioritize the companies here first uh

1493
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:07,520
sean lee at

1494
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:10,640
an even smaller firm discord even newer

1495
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:12,319
only about five years old but

1496
00:52:12,319 --> 00:52:15,920
uh also growing a lot during the covid

1497
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,839
pandemic while folks are at home and

1498
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,280
looking to reach out and make social

1499
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,960
connections

1500
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,599
discord has been called slack for gamers

1501
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:24,240
but uh

1502
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:27,119
it's as rapidly expanding right beyond

1503
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:29,280
that community

1504
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:31,440
and you've done a lot of reporting

1505
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,280
around trust and safety i want to say

1506
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,559
you're the only firm that actually

1507
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:36,480
reports the raw numbers

1508
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:38,559
of all the user flags you get so i'd

1509
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:39,760
love to hear about

1510
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:43,280
um about your work there and just to

1511
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,359
call out that you are the third usf

1512
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:48,079
law alum joe dawns on this panel so

1513
00:52:48,079 --> 00:52:50,240
thanks for thanks for joining us sean

1514
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:52,319
yeah absolutely happy happy to be here

1515
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,000
and thanks to access now for for

1516
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,920
um putting in all the hard work on on

1517
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,200
such an important topic

1518
00:52:57,200 --> 00:52:59,839
um i i mean actually as jessica said

1519
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:00,559
right like i think

1520
00:53:00,559 --> 00:53:02,559
meaningful transparency reporting is is

1521
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:04,240
different across companies and

1522
00:53:04,240 --> 00:53:05,920
and i think that's actually where sort

1523
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:07,520
of our uh

1524
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,559
focus on on user flagging and and on

1525
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,880
enforcement came from that i think a lot

1526
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:13,680
of what we

1527
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,720
sort of saw uh in the

1528
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:19,359
really in in our user base and in the

1529
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:21,040
discussion was that there was kind of

1530
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,800
right like enforcement is often a black

1531
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,920
box right and you don't

1532
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,400
really know why decisions are being made

1533
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:27,680
you don't know how they're being made

1534
00:53:27,680 --> 00:53:29,040
like there's just a lot of like

1535
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,720
uncertainty of like oh like

1536
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,160
why did my account get banned why did

1537
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:34,240
this post come down and so i think we we

1538
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:35,599
really approach it from that level of

1539
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:36,240
like oh

1540
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,160
this is an area where there is a lot of

1541
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,520
uncertainty where there's a lot of

1542
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,680
lack of clarity and and we wanted to to

1543
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:42,640
address that for

1544
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:44,240
for us i think the the transparency

1545
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,920
reporting really comes from right like

1546
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,800
it is about

1547
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,520
showing users like what is going on and

1548
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,599
users civil society right the press

1549
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:53,359
like what's going on what it looks like

1550
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:55,599
we i think the analogy is sort of that

1551
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:57,040
like we look at these transparency

1552
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,240
reports especially on the enforcement

1553
00:53:58,240 --> 00:53:58,720
side

1554
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:01,440
kind of like um annual crime reports

1555
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:03,119
that like a city or a state

1556
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,800
issues right in the same way that you

1557
00:54:04,800 --> 00:54:06,720
sort of probably want to know what like

1558
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,400
a city's crime rate looks like across

1559
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,400
various things before you move there

1560
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:11,760
it probably also makes sense that you

1561
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,200
would kind of want to know what your

1562
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:14,960
online space looks like before you go

1563
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,359
there

1564
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,359
um and so that that was sort of the rule

1565
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:19,119
of um us us driving us

1566
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,559
i i do think that there are a number of

1567
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,319
companies now that are reporting you

1568
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:23,200
know content

1569
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,160
uh enforcement actions to some degree um

1570
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:26,559
and

1571
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,040
i think it really like depends on the

1572
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:30,880
the company right on

1573
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,400
you can imagine that at some of the

1574
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,559
right like because discord tends to be a

1575
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,680
more

1576
00:54:35,680 --> 00:54:37,599
private company um right like you have

1577
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:38,880
to have an account you have to join

1578
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,440
servers

1579
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,960
you can't just sort of like drive by and

1580
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,720
browse right like i think the reporting

1581
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,160
metrics are different which is why i

1582
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,200
think it is hard

1583
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,799
um as mentioned to sort of compare these

1584
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,720
things apples to apples but i think by

1585
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,400
and large right the more transparency

1586
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,079
that we can sort of bring on any of

1587
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,079
these topics right the better it is

1588
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:55,920
um the the one other thing on being a

1589
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:57,359
small company yeah we're i think

1590
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,160
we're a little bit over 280 people right

1591
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:00,480
now

1592
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,400
and we've done transparency reports now

1593
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:03,920
for uh

1594
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:06,160
three cycles so six months right a bit

1595
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:07,200
over a year and a half

1596
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:08,799
um i think it really is about just

1597
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,319
prioritizing it and making sure that you

1598
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:11,680
make those investments early right the

1599
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:13,760
earlier on you spend time and resources

1600
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,240
on

1601
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:17,440
uh on being able to gather the data

1602
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:18,559
collate the data and make sure that

1603
00:55:18,559 --> 00:55:20,000
you're presenting it well the easier it

1604
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,760
is later on you don't have to wait right

1605
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:22,559
like we

1606
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:24,400
we went from you know sub 50 million

1607
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,480
users to 100 million daily users over

1608
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:27,599
the last year or so

1609
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:28,880
and we just put a lot of that

1610
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:31,440
infrastructure in in 2018 and that's all

1611
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:32,400
paid off now

1612
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,319
um i think as with a lot of companies as

1613
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:36,000
with i think every company really here

1614
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,559
certainly

1615
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:38,559
you know we continue to try and make

1616
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,319
transparency reporting better

1617
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:42,559
and part of that is giving more context

1618
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:43,760
right part of that is

1619
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,440
uh making it accessible not just i think

1620
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,599
to civil society that is interested in

1621
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:49,520
sort of seeing what things look like

1622
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:50,880
from uh from

1623
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:53,200
across every platform but also like

1624
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:54,960
talking actually directly to our users

1625
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:55,920
and being like hey

1626
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,079
when you report a user for harassment

1627
00:55:58,079 --> 00:55:59,680
this is what happens right this is what

1628
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:00,880
it looks like this is like

1629
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,880
what you can expect because i think at

1630
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,240
the end of the day right like having a

1631
00:56:04,240 --> 00:56:04,799
model

1632
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:06,799
that kind of is more maybe a little bit

1633
00:56:06,799 --> 00:56:08,240
closer to for example the american

1634
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,319
judiciary model right where you

1635
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:12,640
in most cases can actually see like how

1636
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,079
a case went down

1637
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,920
and what happened to it right like what

1638
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:17,839
the entire sort of like steps in the

1639
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:18,799
investigation

1640
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,559
in the prosecution in the assessment

1641
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,400
were right i think that engenders the

1642
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,040
trust

1643
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,119
in the company right in in the process

1644
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:26,400
really that i think we're all looking

1645
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:26,799
for

1646
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:29,920
so yeah thanks sean yeah

1647
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,359
i did want to ask you because you were

1648
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,880
in tech i think your trust and safety

1649
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:34,720
even before going to law school and then

1650
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,599
came out

1651
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,920
were there rules it sounds like you you

1652
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,160
took a lot from the process of law

1653
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:42,640
um and you know maybe in due process and

1654
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,079
are applying it here are there

1655
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:45,599
are there rules are there substantive

1656
00:56:45,599 --> 00:56:47,599
rules say the unguiding principles on

1657
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:49,200
business and human rights

1658
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,440
that you're also drawing from uh in the

1659
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:53,680
law yeah absolutely i i mean i i think

1660
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:55,520
that the fields of trust and safety and

1661
00:56:55,520 --> 00:56:57,599
and um content moderation and the law

1662
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,960
are are pretty close right

1663
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:00,880
not just for i think you know regulatory

1664
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,240
reasons or stuff like that but i think

1665
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:02,640
that

1666
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:05,280
fundamentally the study of law is really

1667
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,440
right like a study of the systems

1668
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:09,839
you know contractual systems that allow

1669
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:11,119
society to operate

1670
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,000
um and i would say that you know from uh

1671
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,280
both of course like

1672
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:17,119
history and how governments currently

1673
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,559
operate and of course the excellent work

1674
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,240
that all of these ngos are doing right

1675
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,000
there's a lot of stuff that we draw from

1676
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:22,799
to understand

1677
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,480
how trust and safety processes at

1678
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:27,599
discord should work

1679
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,000
awesome thanks and uh yeah i i think our

1680
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,280
next speaker is going to be able to

1681
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,559
provide that

1682
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:34,559
that macro overview again dunstan

1683
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,680
allison hope is

1684
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:39,280
vice president at bsr bsr predates even

1685
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:41,839
google founded in 1992

1686
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:44,160
um and has really been was at the

1687
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:45,680
forefront and continues

1688
00:57:45,680 --> 00:57:47,839
at the forefront of the trend of

1689
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,280
business uh respect for

1690
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,559
sustainability and human rights um

1691
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,720
dunstan i'm wondering uh we've drilled

1692
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,400
down from you know some of the largest

1693
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:57,520
tech companies to

1694
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:00,480
to some of the newest and smallest um

1695
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,119
where

1696
00:58:01,119 --> 00:58:04,000
uh is the tech sector in comparison with

1697
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,599
with uh the rest of the business

1698
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,240
universe

1699
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,440
um i i'd love for uh you to give us an

1700
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,079
overview thanks

1701
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,160
great thank you peter and i was going to

1702
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,440
open by saying as

1703
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,040
nearly 30 years old we're probably the

1704
00:58:17,040 --> 00:58:19,280
oldest organization on the on the panel

1705
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,599
here

1706
00:58:19,599 --> 00:58:22,240
and you stole my line um so first of all

1707
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,680
thank you for hosting this important

1708
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,960
discussion we have been working with

1709
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,599
companies

1710
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:27,760
on issues of transparency across a range

1711
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:29,040
of different issues

1712
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:30,880
going back to the early 1990s and so

1713
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:33,200
it's been really encouraging to see

1714
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:35,119
the evolution of transparency reporting

1715
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,359
in the technology industry over the past

1716
00:58:37,359 --> 00:58:40,240
decade or so and so when i think when it

1717
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:40,960
comes to

1718
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,040
issues of transparency around

1719
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,400
relationships with law enforcement

1720
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,359
agencies

1721
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:47,040
how companies share data with law

1722
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,480
enforcement agencies

1723
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:50,799
as well as the broader sort of content

1724
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:52,160
governance field

1725
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:54,079
i think the technology industry stands

1726
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:56,079
way ahead of other industries

1727
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,200
and i think in reflecting about the past

1728
00:58:59,200 --> 00:59:00,960
decade of transparency reporting and

1729
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:03,280
thinking about the next decade

1730
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:05,359
the key sort of thought that came to

1731
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:06,319
mind for me

1732
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,319
is that what we'd like to see over the

1733
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:10,240
next decade are more transparency

1734
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,200
reports

1735
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:13,119
published by companies outside of the

1736
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:15,839
technology industry

1737
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:18,160
so you know while the scope of

1738
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,400
transparency reporting has evolved over

1739
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,640
time i still think at their core

1740
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,960
it covers the relationships companies

1741
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:26,640
have with law enforcement agencies how

1742
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:27,200
they

1743
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,599
manage those relationships and how they

1744
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:30,319
share data

1745
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,799
with with law enforcement agencies but

1746
00:59:32,799 --> 00:59:34,079
of course tech companies are not the

1747
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:35,760
only ones that have those relationships

1748
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:36,799
tech companies are not the only

1749
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:38,319
companies that share data with law

1750
00:59:38,319 --> 00:59:39,920
enforcement agencies

1751
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,359
um whether it's the retail industry

1752
00:59:41,359 --> 00:59:43,119
financial services health care

1753
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,000
travel automotive logistics all of those

1754
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:47,680
industries in different ways have

1755
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,440
relationships with law enforcement

1756
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,200
and shared data and so what we would

1757
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,280
like to see are reports from companies

1758
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:54,480
across

1759
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:57,599
a much wider range of issues um

1760
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,839
sorry much wider range of industries

1761
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:00,799
covering some of these

1762
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,400
similar issues to those that are covered

1763
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,960
in uh technology industry transparency

1764
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:05,920
reports

1765
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:08,400
now somebody made the point you know who

1766
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:10,240
are the audiences transparency for what

1767
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,240
purpose and i think for us

1768
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:13,680
we undertake a lot of human rights due

1769
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:16,000
diligence with companies and we find the

1770
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,839
transparency reports to be a really

1771
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:19,280
helpful contribution to that human

1772
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:20,559
rights due diligence

1773
01:00:20,559 --> 01:00:22,799
and both because the company has got its

1774
01:00:22,799 --> 01:00:25,520
own sort of house in order ahead of time

1775
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,440
and so there's an organized way of

1776
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:28,960
understanding the company's impact on

1777
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,319
privacy or other human rights for

1778
01:00:30,319 --> 01:00:31,359
example

1779
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,440
and but also gives us a sort of head

1780
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:34,720
start you know if we're doing a human

1781
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:36,319
rights assessment for a telecoms company

1782
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:37,440
or an internet company

1783
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,920
a transparency report gives you a head

1784
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:41,119
start on that process

1785
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:43,440
and my fear is that when we do human

1786
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:45,040
rights due diligence with companies in

1787
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,400
other industries

1788
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,640
we lack some of that insight on how they

1789
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:50,480
might impact rights to privacy

1790
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:52,720
or how other rights may be impacted as a

1791
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,200
result of violations to privacy rights

1792
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,119
and how that might manifest itself in a

1793
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:58,319
range of other

1794
01:00:58,319 --> 01:01:00,799
contexts

1795
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:05,680
and this isn't just voluntary i mean i

1796
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:07,280
think when this started this was largely

1797
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:09,040
voluntary right but we're moving to a

1798
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,160
world where

1799
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,559
where regulation is going to be driving

1800
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:13,359
company

1801
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:15,760
action right um can you tell us about

1802
01:01:15,760 --> 01:01:16,880
what might be coming

1803
01:01:16,880 --> 01:01:20,000
um in the eu especially around human

1804
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:22,240
rights due diligence

1805
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,880
yes so in the eu there are proposals for

1806
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,799
mandatory human rights due diligence by

1807
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:27,440
companies

1808
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:29,520
and so that would be pretty much all

1809
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,000
companies of all industries of of all

1810
01:01:32,000 --> 01:01:33,040
sizes

1811
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,520
and they would be expected to apply an

1812
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,119
approach that's very similar to that

1813
01:01:37,119 --> 01:01:38,559
which is in the u.n guiding principles

1814
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:39,920
on business and human rights

1815
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:42,720
and so that means reviewing your all of

1816
01:01:42,720 --> 01:01:43,359
your

1817
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:45,119
activities across your entire value

1818
01:01:45,119 --> 01:01:46,559
chain against

1819
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:49,040
all human rights and so what intrigues

1820
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:50,240
me is if

1821
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:54,000
companies from non-technology industries

1822
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:56,240
do that effectively they are inevitably

1823
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:57,920
going to come up against

1824
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,760
how we share data with law enforcement

1825
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,359
agencies and how we collaborate with law

1826
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:02,559
enforcement agencies

1827
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,440
so i wonder whether that a regulatory

1828
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:06,079
process

1829
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:08,160
is going to result in greater

1830
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,520
understanding of these issues

1831
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:12,480
in in other sectors and you know we were

1832
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:13,119
founded

1833
01:02:13,119 --> 01:02:15,680
uh 30 years ago have you before many of

1834
01:02:15,680 --> 01:02:16,960
the technology companies that exist

1835
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,440
today

1836
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:19,680
exist so we're working on human rights

1837
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,359
uh impacts with

1838
01:02:21,359 --> 01:02:22,400
companies from a range of other

1839
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,760
industries and so that's something we're

1840
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:25,920
really looking forward to

1841
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:28,880
over the coming decade

1842
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,559
thanks so much dunstan so

1843
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:34,400
we've heard from the people producing

1844
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,240
the reports we've heard from the

1845
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,160
the person uh telling the companies to

1846
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,359
produce the reports

1847
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:41,119
and uh now i think it's time to hear

1848
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,359
from those who actually use and read you

1849
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,119
know who's the audience for these

1850
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:47,039
uh this is the point where if we're were

1851
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,200
at writescon i had asked a poll of who's

1852
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:51,200
actually read a full transparency report

1853
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,960
that that they didn't write

1854
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:56,000
um and uh and and who's found them

1855
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:57,520
useful in their work

1856
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:00,079
um so maybe you at home can just raise

1857
01:03:00,079 --> 01:03:01,440
your hand

1858
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,720
let's go to luis matsakis an experienced

1859
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:05,760
journalist

1860
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,039
at publications like wired in

1861
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:08,799
motherboard is now writing out a

1862
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,960
fantastic new non-profit journalism

1863
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:11,520
project

1864
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:14,880
rest of world founded by a former tech

1865
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:16,480
exec rest of the world tells stories

1866
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:17,119
where tech

1867
01:03:17,119 --> 01:03:20,480
culture and human experience collide

1868
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:22,880
louise welcome and uh can you tell us uh

1869
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:23,520
who are these

1870
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,799
reports for and do you think they're

1871
01:03:26,799 --> 01:03:31,839
successful at telling a story

1872
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:44,079
might be muted um we needed one person

1873
01:03:44,079 --> 01:03:46,799
can you hear me now yeah okay uh so i

1874
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:48,240
think one thing that's good to note is

1875
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,359
that rest of world

1876
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,280
doesn't cover the west so that's sort of

1877
01:03:51,280 --> 01:03:53,359
where the name comes from we only cover

1878
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:57,359
asia africa south america latin america

1879
01:03:57,359 --> 01:03:58,799
and sort of eastern europe so these

1880
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:00,799
reports are incredibly important to our

1881
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:02,559
reporting especially because these are

1882
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,760
often governments that

1883
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,480
are not transparent whatsoever and these

1884
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,319
transparency reports give really

1885
01:04:08,319 --> 01:04:10,000
important insight into how these

1886
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,520
governments are behaving

1887
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:13,920
for example we saw india block tick tock

1888
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:15,520
this year and it was really interesting

1889
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,200
to look at tick tock's transparency

1890
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:18,160
report and see

1891
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:21,039
that india was one of the top uh you

1892
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:22,559
know governments that was requesting

1893
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,319
data from the company and that indicated

1894
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,760
to me that they were you know

1895
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,359
potentially upset with some of the

1896
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,039
content on the platform right they had a

1897
01:04:29,039 --> 01:04:30,880
high number of removal requests

1898
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:32,880
and you know that told me a story that

1899
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:34,079
was different from the story that the

1900
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,119
indian government

1901
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:36,559
was saying which was that this was about

1902
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,480
you know india china relations

1903
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:40,400
uh but to me the transparency report

1904
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,000
kind of showed that instead this was a

1905
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:44,000
story about perhaps censorship

1906
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:46,079
uh and about wanting to you know clamp

1907
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:48,240
down on free expression so these reports

1908
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:50,000
are incredibly important for showing

1909
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,280
those sorts of trends

1910
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:54,559
uh they really provide a lot of uh

1911
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,640
insight into what governments are doing

1912
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:57,839
in places where they don't really want

1913
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:00,000
to speak to journalists like me

1914
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:01,280
i think that there are ways that they're

1915
01:05:01,280 --> 01:05:03,119
not working for example

1916
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:05,039
i have noticed that a lot of companies

1917
01:05:05,039 --> 01:05:06,640
turn to transparency reports

1918
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:09,200
long after they have faced scandals over

1919
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:10,319
content moderation

1920
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:12,400
or over government surveillance for

1921
01:05:12,400 --> 01:05:14,400
example we saw that a lot with zoom this

1922
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:15,200
year

1923
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:16,640
and zoom actually missed the first

1924
01:05:16,640 --> 01:05:18,319
deadline to release its transparency

1925
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,160
report and it's still sort of tbd about

1926
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,000
when they're going to release it and

1927
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,359
that brings up another point that

1928
01:05:23,359 --> 01:05:24,880
dunstan was making is that

1929
01:05:24,880 --> 01:05:26,480
we see a lot of companies like google

1930
01:05:26,480 --> 01:05:27,920
have a great legacy here with

1931
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:29,520
transparency reporting but

1932
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:32,319
i really want to see a wider range of

1933
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:34,000
tech companies that are handling user

1934
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,039
data

1935
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,880
that's you know both like telcos that's

1936
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:39,280
sort of like software like

1937
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,079
uh zoom and i really want to see sort of

1938
01:05:42,079 --> 01:05:42,799
like not

1939
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:45,039
just the major social platforms take up

1940
01:05:45,039 --> 01:05:46,880
this initiative and i hope that sort of

1941
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,720
pressure from government regulation will

1942
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,319
make that more possible

1943
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:51,760
uh but this is a really important

1944
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:53,760
practice and i think that uh you know a

1945
01:05:53,760 --> 01:05:54,960
lot of journalists like me would be

1946
01:05:54,960 --> 01:05:59,039
worse off without transparency reporting

1947
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,920
thanks so much um yeah and uh can you

1948
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:03,599
can you expand though and tell us more

1949
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,400
about

1950
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,720
um how this is useful uh in other

1951
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:07,839
countries and

1952
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:09,520
and whether this practice is actually

1953
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:11,920
being taken up by non-western companies

1954
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:13,599
uh we had i think just one

1955
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,680
uh we had cacao give us a video as well

1956
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,520
as was telia based in

1957
01:06:17,520 --> 01:06:19,599
europe but um the rest have been mostly

1958
01:06:19,599 --> 01:06:21,920
us companies we're talking about

1959
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,680
yeah so this is not really happening in

1960
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,280
a lot of places right i think both

1961
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,640
because of government pressure and

1962
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:27,839
because there's not a lot of other

1963
01:06:27,839 --> 01:06:29,440
incentives for companies to take up this

1964
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:30,480
sort of reporting

1965
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,240
but we have seen tick tock for example

1966
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,000
which is a chinese company that's now

1967
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:35,119
operating in you know

1968
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:37,280
western countries take this up i think

1969
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,520
because of the sorts of pressure

1970
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,000
from governments from civil society from

1971
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,079
journalists to open up about this data

1972
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:45,680
because the nice thing about this data

1973
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:47,039
and making it as public and as

1974
01:06:47,039 --> 01:06:48,559
transparent as possible

1975
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:50,720
is that you know it allows you to kind

1976
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:52,400
of escape a lot of the questions because

1977
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:53,920
you can say look the data's all here

1978
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:55,760
this is what we've seen

1979
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,280
and it's important for it to be as

1980
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,520
comprehensive as possible

1981
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,440
and you can sort of see trends over time

1982
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:02,559
especially you know i've seen some

1983
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:04,160
companies take up this practice for a

1984
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:05,760
couple of years and then say ah like no

1985
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,200
one's really looking at it

1986
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:09,359
uh and that's a huge problem because

1987
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:10,240
it's really

1988
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,240
you know a big indicator for us to see

1989
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,520
okay you know

1990
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:15,839
five years ago egypt was only sending 10

1991
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,520
requests a quarter to this tech company

1992
01:07:17,520 --> 01:07:19,280
and now they're sending a 100 or you

1993
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:20,160
know 200

1994
01:07:20,160 --> 01:07:21,839
that's a huge increase it indicates that

1995
01:07:21,839 --> 01:07:23,039
there's something happening there

1996
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:23,680
between

1997
01:07:23,680 --> 01:07:25,680
the user base of that platform and the

1998
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,119
government another

1999
01:07:27,119 --> 01:07:29,520
big uh factor that i really like to see

2000
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:30,160
or a big

2001
01:07:30,160 --> 01:07:33,520
reporting metric is how often are those

2002
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,240
uh requests denied because that tells me

2003
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:37,599
that there's some sort of overreach

2004
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,960
happening there right like if most of

2005
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:40,319
the requests are accepted then it's

2006
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:41,280
perhaps you know there's a good

2007
01:07:41,280 --> 01:07:42,640
relationship there between law

2008
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:43,599
enforcement

2009
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:44,880
and the platform and that's not

2010
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:46,720
necessarily a negative thing but if a

2011
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:48,160
high percentage of those requests are

2012
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,079
getting denied that indicates to me that

2013
01:07:50,079 --> 01:07:51,839
that government is maybe you know

2014
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:54,319
overreaching into people's privacy um

2015
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:55,760
and it's good to see the platform sort

2016
01:07:55,760 --> 01:07:57,359
of standing up in that way right it's

2017
01:07:57,359 --> 01:07:58,240
not a good sign

2018
01:07:58,240 --> 01:07:59,920
if a tech company is accepting every

2019
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:01,280
single request they get from every

2020
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,000
government that's a very bad sign really

2021
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:05,599
so you know seeing those sorts of

2022
01:08:05,599 --> 01:08:07,119
metrics can be really helpful

2023
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:09,039
to understand how governments are

2024
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:10,960
interacting with tech platforms

2025
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:12,720
um and also just to see sometimes when

2026
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:13,839
they're they don't seem to be

2027
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,039
intervening at all

2028
01:08:15,039 --> 01:08:16,640
um because that also tells me that

2029
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,238
there's maybe you know potential

2030
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,520
problems there i think there's sort of a

2031
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:20,880
good balance

2032
01:08:20,880 --> 01:08:22,960
where you know law enforcement and

2033
01:08:22,960 --> 01:08:24,399
governments do want to interact with

2034
01:08:24,399 --> 01:08:25,839
these platforms you know do want to

2035
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:27,359
participate in safety

2036
01:08:27,359 --> 01:08:29,759
in legitimate cases um but the

2037
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,279
transparency reports are the only way to

2038
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:31,920
sort of see

2039
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:33,759
to what extent that is happening and how

2040
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:37,359
that relationship is evolving over time

2041
01:08:37,359 --> 01:08:38,880
right and you can track the rates of

2042
01:08:38,880 --> 01:08:40,399
compliance and and it seems like

2043
01:08:40,399 --> 01:08:42,479
governments are learning better how to

2044
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:44,880
request data and demand data from

2045
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:46,238
companies right

2046
01:08:46,238 --> 01:08:49,520
thanks great so

2047
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,719
um another key stakeholder group that

2048
01:08:52,719 --> 01:08:54,799
has used these reports and really made

2049
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:55,759
the numbers

2050
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,719
meaningful uh is is of course academia

2051
01:08:58,719 --> 01:08:59,759
and uh we're

2052
01:08:59,759 --> 01:09:02,080
glad to welcome elizabeth ranieres i was

2053
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,319
affiliated with harvard's car center

2054
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:06,960
as well as the berkman client center but

2055
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:07,359
is now

2056
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,120
interim policy at ranking digital rights

2057
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,479
um the fantastic foundation founded by

2058
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,719
um rebecca mckinnon a project of the new

2059
01:09:16,719 --> 01:09:18,238
america foundation

2060
01:09:18,238 --> 01:09:20,560
um and elizabeth uh i'd love to hear

2061
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,238
more about um

2062
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,479
where you see reporting going and where

2063
01:09:24,479 --> 01:09:26,080
really ranking digital rights is

2064
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:29,279
is leading uh the reporting towards um

2065
01:09:29,279 --> 01:09:34,399
as uh uh as we passed ten years

2066
01:09:34,399 --> 01:09:36,158
thanks peter and thanks to access now

2067
01:09:36,158 --> 01:09:37,600
for hosting

2068
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:39,600
so ranking digital rights has been uh

2069
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:41,120
publishing a corporate accountability

2070
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:42,080
index since

2071
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:45,600
2015. in 2015 we ranked 16 companies on

2072
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:47,920
31 indicators and in our forthcoming

2073
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,120
2020 index

2074
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:51,839
we'll be ranking 26 companies on 58

2075
01:09:51,839 --> 01:09:53,040
indicators so

2076
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,719
it gives you a sense that norms really

2077
01:09:54,719 --> 01:09:56,080
are starting to emerge

2078
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:58,080
and consensus is starting to build on

2079
01:09:58,080 --> 01:09:59,600
both normative and non-normative

2080
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,400
standards

2081
01:10:00,400 --> 01:10:02,080
um but it's still challenging because as

2082
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:03,520
you noted peter this was

2083
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:06,000
uh this trend really emerged in part uh

2084
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,679
after the snowden revelations and so

2085
01:10:07,679 --> 01:10:08,880
what we still see

2086
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:11,120
is a residual imbalance between

2087
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:12,239
transparency on

2088
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:14,320
government demands and versus

2089
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:15,920
enforcement of companies own

2090
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,159
internal rules and policies things like

2091
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,080
terms of service enforcement

2092
01:10:20,080 --> 01:10:21,840
and this is also of course partly due as

2093
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:23,520
some others mentioned to

2094
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,280
things like gni membership which focuses

2095
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:26,800
on government requests

2096
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,679
um but for example in the 2015 rdr index

2097
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,679
not a single company reported on terms

2098
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,880
of service enforcement

2099
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,199
and over time we've seen uh you know

2100
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,880
more detail and improvements

2101
01:10:36,880 --> 01:10:39,199
in that area um to the point where in

2102
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,880
our forthcoming index we've actually

2103
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,120
created an entire indicator family

2104
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:44,080
around things like

2105
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:46,320
enforcement of internal policies so for

2106
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,239
example in terms of service enforcement

2107
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,080
separating things like account versus

2108
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,440
contact restrictions

2109
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,440
um we've also asked for more details

2110
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:54,560
around

2111
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,400
advertising content and advertising

2112
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:58,000
targeting policies

2113
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,480
and internal enforcement of those so um

2114
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:02,239
the changes are there although they're

2115
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:03,280
incremental

2116
01:11:03,280 --> 01:11:04,960
um but one of the biggest challenges we

2117
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,040
see and an area of focus in the future

2118
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,360
is that um companies are still defining

2119
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:10,800
the nature and the parameters of

2120
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,280
transparency and transparency reporting

2121
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,199
um really we can't let industry set the

2122
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,960
terms we do need government civil

2123
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:19,360
society academia and researchers

2124
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:21,120
and really importantly um communities

2125
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:22,719
who are really effective and who

2126
01:11:22,719 --> 01:11:24,320
you know stand to have their human

2127
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:26,400
rights impacted to be substantively

2128
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,560
involved in the process of developing

2129
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,400
the standards and the the indicators for

2130
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,080
these transparency reports

2131
01:11:32,080 --> 01:11:34,000
um another thing to note is that we are

2132
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,520
getting more um sort of

2133
01:11:35,520 --> 01:11:36,800
quantitative and substantive

2134
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,719
transparency so the what

2135
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:42,480
right around actions taken posts removed

2136
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,320
uh things like that but they're still

2137
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:46,000
they still tend to be aggregated and

2138
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:47,920
aggregation is a huge problem

2139
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,640
um when things like types of content or

2140
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,400
restrictions or even types of rules and

2141
01:11:52,400 --> 01:11:53,920
force are aggregated it really blurs the

2142
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,600
picture for some of these stakeholders

2143
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,120
particularly in civil society

2144
01:11:57,120 --> 01:11:59,760
academia and researchers and really

2145
01:11:59,760 --> 01:12:01,520
undermines our ability to understand and

2146
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:02,800
interpret the reports

2147
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,560
um so there you know we would strongly

2148
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:06,480
encourage looking at the santa clara

2149
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:07,440
principles

2150
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:09,280
that really break down the effective

2151
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,360
type of reporting metrics there

2152
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:12,800
but an important thing to note in the

2153
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,719
future is that we need to get

2154
01:12:14,719 --> 01:12:16,480
more of the one but we also need more of

2155
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,000
the why and the how

2156
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,920
so we need more qualitative reporting we

2157
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:22,400
need trans process transparency

2158
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,239
the process transparency is really

2159
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,840
important because what it does

2160
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:28,320
is it creates sort of replicable

2161
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:30,320
standards it creates the basis by which

2162
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,360
we can

2163
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,280
actually implement effect and design

2164
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,520
effective accountability standards

2165
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:37,440
and then process transparency this is

2166
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:39,679
data about rationale around how rules

2167
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,440
are formulated how policies are

2168
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:42,000
developed

2169
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:43,920
how actions are taken and decisions are

2170
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:45,600
made and even things like the

2171
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:46,880
relationship between

2172
01:12:46,880 --> 01:12:49,199
human versus automated decision making

2173
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:51,360
how moderators are trained how training

2174
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:52,960
data sets are developed

2175
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,800
from the rationale you know for for

2176
01:12:54,800 --> 01:12:56,239
those methodologies

2177
01:12:56,239 --> 01:12:57,920
um and you know as jessica pointed out

2178
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,360
the companies and services are

2179
01:12:59,360 --> 01:13:01,440
really different um nevertheless the

2180
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:03,199
process transparency is sort of an area

2181
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,719
where there can be more alignment

2182
01:13:04,719 --> 01:13:06,159
and in some ways it's even more

2183
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:08,320
important because it forms the basis for

2184
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:09,520
these effective

2185
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:12,239
interventions that i outlined so in

2186
01:13:12,239 --> 01:13:13,840
terms of the substantive transparency

2187
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:15,520
you know we are seeing better

2188
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:17,199
uh we are seeing better disclosures

2189
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:19,199
there but again even on things like

2190
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,960
very basic things like data collection

2191
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:22,960
and use um we're not seeing enough

2192
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,480
information around for example

2193
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:26,320
inferred or ambient data which we know

2194
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:27,520
are really fundamental

2195
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,360
and have a really profound impact on

2196
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,280
people's privacy and other fundamental

2197
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:33,199
rights and we need more transparency

2198
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:34,560
around the use of algorithms and

2199
01:13:34,560 --> 01:13:35,840
targeted advertising

2200
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:39,040
uh which as um a co-panelist noted will

2201
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:40,320
be a focus in the

2202
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:42,880
europe's digital services act as well so

2203
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,159
that's an area where there's likely to

2204
01:13:44,159 --> 01:13:46,320
be regulatory intervention

2205
01:13:46,320 --> 01:13:49,120
um we still lack context a lot of

2206
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:50,440
information disclosed is

2207
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,840
decontextualized

2208
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,400
um so without recontextualizing the

2209
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:55,360
content it's not going to be

2210
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,800
reproducible and it's not going to form

2211
01:13:56,800 --> 01:13:57,840
the basis for

2212
01:13:57,840 --> 01:14:00,480
the emergence of norms and standards um

2213
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,480
and really as i noted at the outset

2214
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,560
um these transparency reports are still

2215
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:06,000
largely a matter of corporate best

2216
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,600
practice and goodwill

2217
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,199
but we are at the point where we do need

2218
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:10,960
legally binding requirements

2219
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:13,840
um so some of some of the you know

2220
01:14:13,840 --> 01:14:15,520
promising interventions

2221
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:16,800
or excuse me promising developments in

2222
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,880
that regard are that we're seeing better

2223
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:21,120
data for example on appeals so um

2224
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,880
appeals is an area where traditionally

2225
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,560
we haven't seen much information

2226
01:14:24,560 --> 01:14:26,719
we often just got raw data or numbers

2227
01:14:26,719 --> 01:14:27,760
but we're starting to see more

2228
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,600
information around for example the range

2229
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:31,040
of enforcement decisions

2230
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,719
um but they can be better right so

2231
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:34,400
instead of just knowing you can appeal a

2232
01:14:34,400 --> 01:14:35,600
granular decision

2233
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:37,760
can you appeal things like downranking

2234
01:14:37,760 --> 01:14:39,520
or algorithmic manipulation or other

2235
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,360
interventions or automated decision

2236
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:43,440
making and if you can one of the factors

2237
01:14:43,440 --> 01:14:44,080
there

2238
01:14:44,080 --> 01:14:46,080
so um there you know there's also

2239
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:47,120
obviously room for

2240
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:48,719
improvement as i go down advertising

2241
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:51,040
policies um often those things are not

2242
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:52,560
even in transparency reports but they

2243
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:53,040
may be

2244
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:55,440
things like informal company blog posts

2245
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:56,560
um so that is a

2246
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,560
sort of an area for potential process

2247
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,000
standardization as well

2248
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:02,159
um i'll stop there peter in the interest

2249
01:15:02,159 --> 01:15:03,920
of time and happy to take specific

2250
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:05,120
questions

2251
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,840
thanks that was amazing yeah you hit um

2252
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,440
algorithms without without saying

2253
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,280
artificial intelligence i think which

2254
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:13,440
we all appreciate so now that that's

2255
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:15,199
fantastic yeah and we are getting

2256
01:15:15,199 --> 01:15:16,480
questions about um

2257
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:18,400
whether any companies are reporting on

2258
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:20,400
algorithmic transparency on explaining

2259
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:22,159
um their algorithms opening up that

2260
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,960
black box um and we've got that

2261
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:26,400
as well as a couple other company

2262
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,760
focused questions so i think i'll

2263
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:28,880
probably go there

2264
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:31,520
but um one is around the auditing of

2265
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:33,520
transparency reports i think telia gets

2266
01:15:33,520 --> 01:15:35,760
their report assured do any others

2267
01:15:35,760 --> 01:15:38,719
um is it effective um we've got a

2268
01:15:38,719 --> 01:15:39,520
request on

2269
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:42,560
um canadian authorities requesting info

2270
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:43,760
i don't know if there are any secret

2271
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,080
canadians on this panel uh

2272
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:48,640
and then um yeah but i do want to go

2273
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,080
first to

2274
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:52,080
to alex i saw you shaking your head and

2275
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,120
nodding a lot

2276
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:55,120
um at what elizabeth was saying around

2277
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,360
process transparency especially and then

2278
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,880
if you could just tell us um you know

2279
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:00,800
what what google might have planned uh

2280
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:03,520
for your reports

2281
01:16:05,040 --> 01:16:07,600
well i'm not sure i i there's anything i

2282
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:08,719
can share about what we have

2283
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,679
planned just yet but i do really want to

2284
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:13,360
underscore the importance of everything

2285
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:14,719
that was just said

2286
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,679
um around the importance of context and

2287
01:16:17,679 --> 01:16:20,560
qualitative transparency i think we have

2288
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,320
been really trying to think about

2289
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:24,080
you know we have all of these

2290
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,679
transparency reports that provide

2291
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:27,280
metrics and that's obviously very

2292
01:16:27,280 --> 01:16:29,040
important to have the numbers around

2293
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:31,040
enforcement what we're removing what

2294
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,640
we're responding to

2295
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:35,120
but at the same time how can people

2296
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:36,960
understand what our policies actually

2297
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:37,760
are

2298
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,360
and how we enforce them and how we

2299
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:40,960
develop them and so

2300
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:42,400
you know we've begun to do that in

2301
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:44,320
particular ways like we have a

2302
01:16:44,320 --> 01:16:46,000
disinformation white paper and that

2303
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,199
really walks through

2304
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:50,239
how we think about the issue how we have

2305
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,080
created policies across each of our

2306
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:52,640
products

2307
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,040
how we enforce those um and so that's

2308
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:56,719
one way where we've been thinking about

2309
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:57,600
how can we

2310
01:16:57,600 --> 01:16:59,679
help folks understand what we're doing

2311
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:01,040
on a particular issue

2312
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,320
and how that relates to content

2313
01:17:02,320 --> 01:17:05,040
moderation we've done a similar paper

2314
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,520
on information quality that's focused on

2315
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:08,480
how we

2316
01:17:08,480 --> 01:17:12,400
remove raise up reward

2317
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:14,560
content across all of our products as

2318
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,080
well and so that's another effort to

2319
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:17,679
help folks understand

2320
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:18,880
what we're doing with respect to

2321
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:20,719
removals but also what we're doing with

2322
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:23,040
respect to ranking too

2323
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:24,960
um and the other piece i just really i

2324
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,120
think we even think that that context is

2325
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:27,760
important

2326
01:17:27,760 --> 01:17:30,239
when you look at things like our legal

2327
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,040
removals

2328
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:34,719
um that's our shorthand our uh um

2329
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:36,400
a report on government requests for

2330
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,080
removal of content

2331
01:17:38,080 --> 01:17:40,400
uh and we do include annotations as part

2332
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:42,080
of that report and so what that does

2333
01:17:42,080 --> 01:17:44,560
is help um the purpose of that is to

2334
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:45,600
help users

2335
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,600
and anyone using the report understand

2336
01:17:47,600 --> 01:17:49,440
why there might be spikes

2337
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,520
in the report and so you can see that

2338
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:52,560
for example

2339
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:54,960
um on russia where the year that we

2340
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:55,760
implemented

2341
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:58,560
our compliance with the vpn law and you

2342
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:00,480
would see a spike in the urls removed

2343
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,760
across search

2344
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:03,600
and you see that happen in other in

2345
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,360
other countries where you can see

2346
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,760
when a local law was implemented and how

2347
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:09,440
we responded to that

2348
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:11,440
so it really is i think it continues to

2349
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:13,440
be about companies and governments

2350
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,040
that is one important piece that i think

2351
01:18:15,040 --> 01:18:16,480
we should not lose and

2352
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:18,159
continue to advocate for governments to

2353
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,600
be transparent so that we have a

2354
01:18:19,600 --> 01:18:20,239
holistic

2355
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:22,800
understanding of engagement with each

2356
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,239
company but then also

2357
01:18:24,239 --> 01:18:26,560
what the government is doing um but then

2358
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:28,320
really to help folks understand our

2359
01:18:28,320 --> 01:18:29,280
products

2360
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:31,199
um the other thing that we've done is

2361
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:32,640
start to develop

2362
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:35,040
entire sites that are focused on helping

2363
01:18:35,040 --> 01:18:37,040
people understand the product so

2364
01:18:37,040 --> 01:18:39,360
we launched how search works earlier

2365
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:40,960
this year we have

2366
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:42,800
um sorry we launched how youtube works

2367
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,800
earlier this year we have long had how

2368
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:45,840
search works

2369
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:47,920
um and another site called how play

2370
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:50,080
works and that walks through

2371
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,520
all of the policies sort of how we

2372
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:56,320
implement them the way that we think

2373
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:58,159
about the product because certainly how

2374
01:18:58,159 --> 01:18:59,360
we think about it

2375
01:18:59,360 --> 01:19:02,719
that gets back to what we should be

2376
01:19:02,719 --> 01:19:04,400
driving for in transparency and how it

2377
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,760
looks different across each of the

2378
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,400
products

2379
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:09,760
um kind of type of service so what we

2380
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:11,600
want from transparency on search is

2381
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:13,120
maybe not the same thing

2382
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:14,960
that we would want from transparency on

2383
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,719
youtube what we're trying to learn

2384
01:19:16,719 --> 01:19:19,120
and so when we think about comparability

2385
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,719
across types of service

2386
01:19:20,719 --> 01:19:22,239
understanding how the product works is a

2387
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:23,920
big piece of that

2388
01:19:23,920 --> 01:19:27,280
when it comes to um algorithms and how

2389
01:19:27,280 --> 01:19:29,120
they work we are also spending a lot of

2390
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:29,760
time

2391
01:19:29,760 --> 01:19:32,400
working on that and trying to figure out

2392
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:32,960
what is

2393
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,800
what does meaningful transparency look

2394
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:36,400
like how much are we talking about

2395
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:37,440
explainability

2396
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:39,040
just understanding what in fact we're

2397
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:41,360
doing and what types of transparency are

2398
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:42,560
meaningful

2399
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:45,679
to our users to the public to

2400
01:19:45,679 --> 01:19:48,239
experts like the ones on this panel who

2401
01:19:48,239 --> 01:19:49,600
are probably more

2402
01:19:49,600 --> 01:19:51,840
familiar with what companies are doing

2403
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,920
um as well as regulators

2404
01:19:53,920 --> 01:19:56,080
and so how do we you know make that

2405
01:19:56,080 --> 01:19:58,400
information more usable to all of those

2406
01:19:58,400 --> 01:19:59,360
audiences

2407
01:19:59,360 --> 01:20:00,960
those are things that we are currently

2408
01:20:00,960 --> 01:20:02,560
focused on um

2409
01:20:02,560 --> 01:20:05,440
and i think you know things like the eu

2410
01:20:05,440 --> 01:20:06,560
dsa

2411
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,960
um and other regulations and other

2412
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:09,679
policy

2413
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,840
conversations are helping to move the

2414
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,520
move the discussion forward for the

2415
01:20:13,520 --> 01:20:15,920
industry

2416
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:18,800
right yeah uh certainly is regulation

2417
01:20:18,800 --> 01:20:20,159
coming around the corner

2418
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,600
um and and to that uh dunstan can you

2419
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:25,600
tell us about assurance and um how you

2420
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,800
can actually

2421
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:28,639
are these reports trustworthy and and

2422
01:20:28,639 --> 01:20:30,159
who says so um

2423
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:32,480
and then maybe also talk about ways that

2424
01:20:32,480 --> 01:20:34,000
uh reporting here and these rather

2425
01:20:34,000 --> 01:20:35,520
limited reports can fill

2426
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:37,360
um the much larger gap around the range

2427
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:39,199
of human rights that are impacted

2428
01:20:39,199 --> 01:20:42,159
um by tech companies i did just want to

2429
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,000
pick up on the point about

2430
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,280
assurance so assurance exists for two

2431
01:20:47,280 --> 01:20:50,080
reasons insurance exists to make sure

2432
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:53,199
that the things in the report are right

2433
01:20:53,199 --> 01:20:55,120
but it also exists to make sure that the

2434
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,440
right things are in the report

2435
01:20:57,440 --> 01:20:59,120
and we often think about assurance as

2436
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:00,639
making sure the things in the report are

2437
01:21:00,639 --> 01:21:02,000
right in other words making sure they

2438
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:03,280
are accurate

2439
01:21:03,280 --> 01:21:05,760
that they are comparable over over years

2440
01:21:05,760 --> 01:21:06,880
over time

2441
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,480
um it's less common to think about

2442
01:21:08,480 --> 01:21:10,560
assurance as making sure that the right

2443
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:12,080
things are in the report in the first

2444
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:12,880
place

2445
01:21:12,880 --> 01:21:14,719
and so that for me is an interesting

2446
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:16,320
angle when it comes to the lack of

2447
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:17,280
reporting

2448
01:21:17,280 --> 01:21:19,600
by other tech companies or companies in

2449
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:20,480
other industries

2450
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:23,520
so if they're doing effective

2451
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:25,360
full human rights due diligence that

2452
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:27,360
covers the full list of human rights

2453
01:21:27,360 --> 01:21:29,760
and you ask the question are the right

2454
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,920
things in the report in other words the

2455
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:34,000
cumulative disclosures that they

2456
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,400
have i think you might identify that

2457
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,600
there's a big gap here

2458
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,600
in many companies so when we think about

2459
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,440
assurance i guess my point is

2460
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:43,280
don't just think about it as other

2461
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:44,719
things in the report right but also

2462
01:21:44,719 --> 01:21:45,280
think it

2463
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:47,199
think about it in terms of are the right

2464
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,280
things in the report in the first place

2465
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,960
peter i forget the second part of your

2466
01:21:50,960 --> 01:21:52,480
question however

2467
01:21:52,480 --> 01:21:55,600
yes asking how can these reports fill

2468
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:57,440
the general gap around reporting on

2469
01:21:57,440 --> 01:21:59,760
non-financial matters like human rights

2470
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:00,080
and

2471
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:04,320
governance yeah i think

2472
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:06,800
one of the really interesting trends

2473
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,239
over the past decade

2474
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:09,920
of which the transparency reporting

2475
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,840
trend has played a full part

2476
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,760
has been increased disclosure by

2477
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,120
companies on

2478
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:17,520
very specific issues of interest to very

2479
01:22:17,520 --> 01:22:19,280
specific target audiences

2480
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:20,560
and one of the things that i would like

2481
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:22,880
to see from companies going forward

2482
01:22:22,880 --> 01:22:25,760
our reporting strategies that on the one

2483
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:26,800
hand

2484
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:29,360
meet the needs of investors or other

2485
01:22:29,360 --> 01:22:30,639
analysts who might want

2486
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:32,639
the strategic overview of the company

2487
01:22:32,639 --> 01:22:34,560
you know in on one page what are the big

2488
01:22:34,560 --> 01:22:35,920
issues we're addressing and how we are

2489
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,040
addressing them

2490
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,120
and then on the other hand provide the

2491
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,960
really detailed

2492
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:43,920
uh complex information that specific

2493
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:44,719
audiences

2494
01:22:44,719 --> 01:22:48,000
want and achieve both in combination

2495
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:49,440
and i think often we have this

2496
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:50,880
conversation about well does anybody

2497
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,000
really read transparency

2498
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:54,560
reports in my experience they do and

2499
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,840
there are very specific

2500
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:58,480
very important audiences who then use

2501
01:22:58,480 --> 01:22:59,840
that insight

2502
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:02,800
to inform their interactions with with

2503
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:03,199
others

2504
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,600
so i i think i would answer your

2505
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,360
question by saying we'd love to see

2506
01:23:07,360 --> 01:23:09,440
strategic approaches to disclosure by

2507
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:11,360
companies of which this very detailed

2508
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:12,400
information about law enforcement

2509
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:13,600
relationships and other

2510
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,199
elements of transparency reporting would

2511
01:23:15,199 --> 01:23:17,920
be an important part

2512
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,159
thanks dunstan um i want to throw to

2513
01:23:20,159 --> 01:23:23,040
uber uber innovated by

2514
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:24,639
showing requests from airport

2515
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,560
authorities right which is a

2516
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:28,880
key stakeholder for them and their

2517
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,800
clients um

2518
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:33,440
there's a specific question about uh for

2519
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,280
uttara can we get data on country

2520
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:37,120
specific government and legal requests

2521
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:39,250
from uber

2522
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,560
[Music]

2523
01:23:40,560 --> 01:23:42,719
yeah absolutely um i would say visit our

2524
01:23:42,719 --> 01:23:45,520
transparency report

2525
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:47,360
site you can access it from the the main

2526
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:48,560

2527
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:50,639
currently our transparency report is

2528
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:52,800
limited to the us and canada but we're

2529
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,199
actively looking to expand our report

2530
01:23:55,199 --> 01:23:56,639
um and i think that you know the

2531
01:23:56,639 --> 01:23:58,320
complexity with that is just that you

2532
01:23:58,320 --> 01:24:00,000
know regulatory reporting isn't

2533
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:02,239
is enormously complex and you'll see

2534
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:03,040
that when you

2535
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:05,199
take a look at the report trying to

2536
01:24:05,199 --> 01:24:07,120
identify you know other regulators

2537
01:24:07,120 --> 01:24:08,880
transport regulators

2538
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,760
land use regulators globally has been a

2539
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:12,960
challenge

2540
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:14,560
but again to the points that every

2541
01:24:14,560 --> 01:24:16,560
panelist has made it's an investment

2542
01:24:16,560 --> 01:24:17,360
worth making

2543
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,719
and we're we're looking forward to

2544
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:21,600
