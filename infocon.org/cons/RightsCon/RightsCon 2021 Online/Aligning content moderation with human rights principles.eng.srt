accomplishments

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,960

00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,080
people in the space of human rights

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,320
the

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
facebook oversight board uh inaugural

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,160
members of the board

22
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,840
who've been involved for the past year

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,520
beginning with the

24
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,280
the training and orientation that they

25
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,960
went through last year

26
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,600
through all of the different issues that

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,039
many of you will be familiar with that

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,160
they've addressed

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,600
uh over the last several months and um

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,120
and i'm really just delighted to have

31
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,000
them here

32
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,920
this we've designed as a kind of

33
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,920
free-flowing conversation

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,119
and uh what what i'd like to do is ask

35
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,600
each of the each of our panelists

36
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,400
uh each of our oversight board members a

37
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,040
um

38
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
the same kind of question to start and

39
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,560
then we'll just drill down into a number

40
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,000
of issues

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,200
after we go for maybe 30 35 minutes

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,200
or actually throughout this time if you

43
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:28,400
have any questions

44
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,200
please post them we'll look at them and

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,159
we'll be able to

46
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,400
integrate them into our conversation as

47
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,200
well

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
so um so the first question that i want

49
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,119
to ask and i'm going to start with

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,159
nigad and many of you are probably

51
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
familiar with nigat who has been coming

52
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,320
to rights con

53
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,680
for probably many many years founded the

54
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,680
digital rights foundation in pakistan

55
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,040
and is a well-known

56
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,159
human rights defender highly regarded

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
really a leader not just in pakistan but

58
00:01:58,560 --> 00:01:59,520
around the world

59
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,560
on issues of freedom of expression

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,640
and other rights online the intersection

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,320
of rights and online space

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,160
so night i want to start with you and

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,080
and the question that i'm going to ask

64
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,720
each of your

65
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
your co-panelists and board members as

66
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
well is

67
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:18,319
you know you came into this process

68
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,160
of the board with a um a real

69
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,080
significant amount of knowledge

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,680
about how the platforms mediate rights

71
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,040
and you know how they serve as either

72
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,120
gatekeepers or

73
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,360
in a way barriers perhaps to the

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,879
enjoyment of rights

75
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,120
and going in i mean it must have taken

76
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,720
quite a bit of thinking about whether

77
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,080
you would join

78
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,280
i i wonder if you have any if there's

79
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,360
been anything surprising and maybe i'll

80
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
put it this way

81
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,640
what were your expectations about the

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,319
board going in

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,640
and what has been surprising maybe one

84
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,599
or two

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,959
uh issues or or simply

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,879
activities or or decisions that have

87
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,800
been surprising to you over the last

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,360
year um well thank you so much david for

89
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,879
uh having me on a panel and with such a

90
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,319
you know kind introduction um i would

91
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,040
say that

92
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,319
uh when i was

93
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,800
uh offered to be part of the board uh

94
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,319
i'll be very honest i was

95
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,120
uh you know i i took a great amount of

96
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,360
time to think about that because of

97
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
my uh role as a digital rights activist

98
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,040
who have been you know like very vocal

99
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,519
around

100
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
uh tech giants policies especially when

101
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,959
it comes to

102
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
uh global south context our context uh

103
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,360
different issues that we have been

104
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,599
facing um in our countries

105
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,959
um but at the same time i i think i was

106
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:43,840
also

107
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,640
you know like tired of you know uh uh

108
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,959
pushing the companies to make changes in

109
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,480
their policies or you know

110
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,000
do do more about uh the issues that we

111
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
have been raising from our part of the

112
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,959
world

113
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,080
and uh and i was like why not

114
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
you know i should become part of the

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280
uh space where i also have a

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,599
power to make decisions and i think

117
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
that's most of the time you know i as an

118
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
activist in pakistan like we fight for

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
such kind of spaces

120
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,639
um although there there was a you know

121
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,120
con

122
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,600
like considerable considerable amount of

123
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,320
discussion

124
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,120
uh i mean i was also worried about my

125
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,120
own you know like work that i have done

126
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,639
over the past few years

127
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,120
several years and was worried that what

128
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,520
if it doesn't you know turn out the way

129
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,720
i'm thinking

130
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,280
uh but i would say that uh since i

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,960
joined the board there

132
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,600
has been a huge amount of work that has

133
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,000
gone

134
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,759
into making this board as an institution

135
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,320
um um i am i'm sure that you know my

136
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,639
co-panelists will agree to this because

137
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:53,520
uh

138
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,840
the kind the kind of labor we are

139
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,040
putting into this

140
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,160
uh sort of experiment of self-regulation

141
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,440
successful i think that's that's just uh

142
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,360
that's a huge amount of work and the one

143
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,720
thing that you asked me that's

144
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,160
surprising for me

145
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:11,039
uh this is not a traditional board it's

146
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,440
like

147
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,520
you know it's an institution that is

148
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,039
that is in the making so

149
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,759
uh i'll end here and then yeah over to

150
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,479
you

151
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,160
great you got i mean that's that's

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,840
really interesting and i i think it's

153
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,000
especially interesting

154
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,720
for for your kind of pivot and and the

155
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,280
the

156
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,560
um the interest that you perceived in

157
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,120
moving

158
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,320
from or being part of decision making

159
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,400
and not just advocacy i think that's

160
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
really interesting and i want to ask

161
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
maina kiya and um mina who's a dear

162
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,039
friend and former colleague

163
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,680
i love being on a on a panel with mina

164
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,880
because people would

165
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,960
sort of mix up our our names um

166
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,320
we're like you know brothers from

167

00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,880
human rights defenders uh in kenya uh

172
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,000
uh

173
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,560
huma or executive director of the ex of

174
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,560
the kenyan human rights commission

175
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
and with special rapporteur for the u.n

176

00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,319
uh peaceful assembly and association

178
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,080
mina i want to ask you a similar

179
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,759
question that i asked

180
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:21,840
of me god and given that you come from

181
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,919
the kind of a kind of similar space

182
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,960
speaking truth to power in your entire

183
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:28,240
career

184
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,800
what what what were your expectations

185
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,400
going in and and how have you been

186
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,199
surprised

187
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,919
if at all thank you david and it's

188
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,360
really good to see the rest of

189
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,479
my colleagues who we who we only meet

190
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,479
on on on internet we've never actually

191
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,639
met in person sadly so

192
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,560
i think one of my surprises is that we

193
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,000
have gone this far without

194
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,039
without actually shaking hands and

195
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,440
and and looking at people's eye to eye

196
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,560
and seeing whether they have as many

197
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,919
wrinkles as i have so

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,039
so that's been part of the uh the

199
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,319
surprises that this has gone on on on

200
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,560
online as you know for so long and i

201
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,680
hope we can be able to

202
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,280
get offline for a bit and be able to

203
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,120
understand each other better

204
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
my just like night i mean i was

205
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,680
first of all i was totally shocked when

206
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,520
i was asked to to be on this board i

207
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,639
just didn't know i didn't know where the

208
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:17,599
idea came from

209
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
i hadn't had had a very healthy

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,120
disregard of facebook and

211
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,199
arms length relationship with them i was

212
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,400
critical of facebook

213
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,599
in public i frankly don't i didn't like

214
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,199
the company and i don't like the company

215
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,319
i'll say keep saying i haven't changed

216
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,919
my mind about that i think it's a

217
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,319
very dangerous uh enterprise in very

218
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,039
many ways

219
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,280
it's too big it's too rich it's too

220
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,360
powerful and it's a corporate you know

221
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,000
and so

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,400
and i have this view right now that that

223
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,080
one of the big dangers of our world

224
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,240
is is we've got to have corporate

225
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,759
regulation we've got to be

226
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,759
we've got to move away we've got to have

227
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,520
some more ways of putting

228
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
the inequalities that are going on are

229
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
just too much and too much money and too

230
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,919
much power

231
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:57,520
is in too few hands and that's always

232
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,120
dangerous from human rights lengths

233
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,479
so i was kind of surprised when i was

234
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
asked anyway so going back and forth and

235
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:04,720
i when i was eventually i decided to say

236
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,960
yes because it's an experiment and i and

237
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,720
i want to see if it works and

238
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,720
it's one thing to keep to keep attacking

239
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,319
and criticizing another thing to be told

240
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:12,960
okay

241
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,720
so you you try and fix it try and be a

242
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,400
player in fixing it

243
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
and i so i see the role very much as

244
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
that of an internal auditor internal

245
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,199
financial auditor

246
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:23,039
and then the state and the people are

247
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,400
the external auditors

248
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,560
the two do not go are not are not in

249
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,879
kind of distinction so i i find that

250
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,160
very interesting i think very very

251
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,120
important

252
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
i hope this is a experiment that works

253
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
we still don't quite sure it will

254
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,839
i hope it works and it's expanded but

255
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,039
there's got to be some

256
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:41,919
form of regulating and unensuring that

257
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,440
human rights are protected from from

258
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,120
these big platforms the other

259
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
they're the future of the world they've

260
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,680
got to we've got to find a way to live

261
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,200
with them in some form that makes sense

262
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:49,760
to us

263
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,519
and keeps us safe as well as giving us

264
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,200
the platform and the voice that we can

265
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,560
have

266
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,240
i think the major surprises i think for

267
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
me were

268
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,000
well first of all how complex somehow

269
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,920
complex the decisions are sometimes you

270
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,200
look at something from the outside you

271
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,680
think

272
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,279
oh this is very simple you know of

273
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,120
course this should be it should be stay

274
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,720
on of course they should go down

275
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,160
but actually it's a bit more complex

276
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
than that as you

277
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,959
go into it and you look into context and

278
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,959
other stuff a little bit more complex

279
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,959
that that i think was was quite

280
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,440
it was quite uh surprising and and

281
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
that's been interesting that that you're

282
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,000
going to take this you're going to take

283
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,519
this quite seriously and go slowly

284
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,279
through the decision-making processes

285
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:28,880
i think the other better surprise was

286
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
was that would be that was was the

287
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,120
the constant or maybe not constant but

288
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,279
the occasional rise of first amendment

289
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,959
versus international human rights law

290
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,800
and which one goes where and you know

291
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,000
the americans at their first time

292
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,440
now yesterday i'm sure you might have

293
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,680
seen that article about the aclu and

294
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,959
whether the aclu has

295
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,640
has lost it in the new york times it's

296
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,080
lost it's it's it's uh

297
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,000
it's gra it's center of gravity by

298
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,440
moving into progressive issues as

299
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
opposed to being

300
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,120
firmly first amendment your right is is

301
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:55,920
your right and

302
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,839
that there's a big interesting debate

303
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,040
that goes on between

304
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:05,839
in the human rights world

305
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,880
i think we got uh mine paused right

306
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,160
there

307
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,440
um so why don't when i move my

308
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,120
i i'm sorry if you i don't know if you

309
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,640
can hear me or not

310
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,600
that was really fascinating and actually

311
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:20,399
you covered

312
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,640
like three quarters of the questions

313
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,720
that i was planning to ask but that's

314
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,720
okay we'll drill down into them

315
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,959
yeah yeah but the last thing is that you

316
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,240
know when you work together

317
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,279
in a panel you find that whenever you

318
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:34,480
work together in a panel

319
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,200
you find that uh you you have to the

320
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,000
compromise

321
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,279
the amount of compromises you have to

322
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,160
make has been very interesting let's see

323
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,480
that's fantastic um and mine is sorry if

324
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,240
i if it seemed like i interrupted you we

325
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,040
lost you there for

326
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,320
for a second um so i want to i want to

327
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,040
sort of

328
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,920
take from uh from your comment and move

329
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,800
to evelyn

330
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
now evelyn i think anybody who does work

331

is now a professor of law at the

339
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,760
university of oklahoma

340
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,160
um and has done many many other things

341
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:19,279
as really one of

342
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,160
the leading american scholars uh and

343
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,959
commentators

344
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,440
on on international human rights and

345
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
evelyn i i want to ask it's it's sort of

346
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,720
a variation

347
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,560
on the question of expectations and

348
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,640
surprise but maybe i could frame it in a

349
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,760
way taking off from

350
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,000
what myna was suggesting about the

351
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,920
nature of the discussions

352
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,959
around you know sort of the complexity

353
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:41,519
issue

354
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:43,360
and the first amendment human rights

355
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,720
kinds of issues

356
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,519
and i wonder if as you were going in to

357
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,760
the board to taking on this role

358
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,839
what were your expectations and maybe

359
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:52,800
put another way

360
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,360
what were you hoping to accomplish by

361
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,160
joining and

362
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,639
and also on the supr for the surprise

363
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,480
kind of question

364
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,880
um maybe you could tell us a little bit

365
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,079
about

366
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:06,720
the way that you have tried which i

367
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,000
imagine you've tried to do

368
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,399
i don't have any inside knowledge here

369
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:11,040
um

370
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,519
which is to to really educate others who

371
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,040
aren't necessarily human rights

372
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,839
defenders or lawyers or scholars about

373
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,120
how human rights

374
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,040
should operate in this space so those

375
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
two sort of the

376
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,399
expectation and then you know how you've

377
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,680
actually worked to

378
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,600
integrate human rights in this um in

379
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,279
this uh as my

380
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,399
experiment yeah well thanks david and

381
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,240
thank you for moderating the panel

382
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,079
and of course thanks to rightscon for

383
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:37,279
another wonderful

384
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,800
week of of talks um yeah

385
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,440
i was pretty open um you know before

386
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,120
joining the board about what i would

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,519
hope

388
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
it would do and and that was that it

389
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,639
would um

390
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,240
take the un guiding principles on

391
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,760
business and human rights

392
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,480
a framework for how uh companies should

393
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,200
respect

394
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,200
human rights and their operations that

395
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,760
it would really espouse that framework

396
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,000
and and implement it in its day-to-day

397
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,600
work which you know

398
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,680
draws a lot quite frankly on on your

399
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,839
great work as a special rapporteur

400
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,360
in terms of how private uh companies can

401
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,920
moderate contact while respecting

402
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,519
uh the scope of international human

403
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,600
rights protections for freedom of speech

404
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,160
and other rights um so that was that was

405
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,079
my hope and that was what i was writing

406
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,639
to um when they had consultations um

407
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,240
before launching the board

408
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,639
i wrote about these issues to facebook

409
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,160
and i wrote articles about this

410
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
and um and you know i didn't i didn't

411
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,240
know if it would happen

412
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
i felt for years a bunch of us were

413
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,920
going to conferences waving the human

414
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,680
rights law flag and

415
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:42,320
not getting too much traction um and

416
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,360
i've i've been

417
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,639
uh happy uh it's been good to see that

418
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,760
there has been an espousal of

419
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,560
this framework and this um these

420
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,600
standards

421
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,519
these un standards by the board and i

422
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,920
think if folks look at our decisions

423
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,279
you know they'll see that we're quite

424
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,120
rigorous in explaining

425
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,800
how we see ourselves within that

426
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,600
framework as a grievance mechanism

427
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,160
and how we apply those un standards in

428
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
each case

429
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,720
and we try to be very detailed about

430
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:12,399
that

431
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,440
i have been a bit of i would say um

432
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,160
someone who

433
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
tries to give the background explanation

434
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,839
as you've as you mentioned in your

435
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:20,720
question

436
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:24,079
um just to share um uh

437
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,399
some of the research i've been doing in

438
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,199
terms of um

439
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,120
freedom of expression norms at the un

440
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,399
and um

441
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,920
you know there's obviously the u.n human

442
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,760
rights committee has a lot of guidance

443
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,199
you've issued a lot of guidance when you

444
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,040
were the special reporter now we have a

445
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
new repertoire also issuing

446
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,399
uh guidance and i think there's there's

447
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,760
actually a lot out there

448
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,199
to guide us and we are trying to um

449
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,360
to you know filter it and and apply it

450
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,399
as best we can

451
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,760
and and i hope that um um that i'm able

452
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,720
to play a role in

453
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,440
in that process and i would also um give

454
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,639
great kudos to our

455
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,440
our staff which does tremendous uh

456
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,000
research

457
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,279
uh also to help um us in this in this

458
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,199
mandate of applying human rights

459
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,760
standards to our work

460
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,240
great evelyn thanks so much i want to

461
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,440
stick with you for

462
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
for a sort of a follow-on there and you

463
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:14,720
know

464
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
one of the uh results of the debate

465
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,199
around

466
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,920
content moderation and the kind of high

467
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:22,560
profile

468
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,399
over the last six months at least that

469
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
human rights has gained

470
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,639
you know in part in large part because

471
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,320
of the the work that the three of you

472
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
are doing

473
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,079
with the oversight board what kind of

474
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
pushback

475
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,000
do you see because you know the in in

476
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,440
scholarly settings

477
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,079
in in panels you know there's quite a

478
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,759
bit of argument around like

479
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:46,160
does human rights actually provide

480
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,839
appropriate guidance does it provide

481
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,519
enough is it rich enough

482
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:52,320
mina described complexity so it's a very

483
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,480
complex area that you're dealing with

484
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,720
and sometimes law doesn't exactly match

485
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,639
up there might be some indeterminacy

486
00:15:58,639 --> 00:15:59,920
around it

487
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
what what kind of pushback are you

488
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,199
seeing and what are the arguments that

489
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:06,399
that you find resonate with your

490
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,920
other board members well

491
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,680
i'm not going to discuss our internal

492
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,440
discussions um

493
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,720
here necessarily but the discussions

494
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
um that i've seen in terms of a reaction

495
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,120
to the board's work

496
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:24,240
particularly in the u.s are often

497
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,399
i think as maina touched on kind of a a

498
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,000
reluctance about human rights law

499
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,120
and and i think part of it is just um a

500
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,120
lack of um

501
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:39,920
of of background on what international

502
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,240
human rights law is and how it works

503
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,959
um and i'm actually working on an

504
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,320
article now comparing the first

505
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,839
amendment to human rights law

506
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,920
to try to bridge those gaps so people

507
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,199
can see

508
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:53,839
rather than make a judgment um from a

509
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,279
position of not understanding human

510
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,800
rights law and kind of being reluctant

511
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,160
about it

512
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,759
there are also scholars as you've

513
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,600
mentioned who have voiced concerns that

514
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,360
there isn't enough guidance in human

515
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,480
rights law

516
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,959
and really in the work that i'm doing in

517
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:07,679
terms of

518
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,959
accumulating um all the

519
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,640
you know the work that you've done that

520
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,839
the human rights committee has done

521
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,760
there's just an enormous corpus of of

522
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,880
information

523
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,480
and it's just not presented in a very

524
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
human rights way or sorry research

525
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,919
friendly way on the

526
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,760
un website quite frankly and it takes

527
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,520
kind of gathering it all together

528
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,240
to be able um to digest it so i think

529
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,080
that's part of um the problem with

530
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,160
understanding human rights law as a

531
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,760
as a um as a as a matrix as a metrics

532
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,320
and

533
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:40,080
also i think that um all of these cases

534
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,440
even with the application of human

535
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,600
rights law require judgment

536
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,160
right where's that line on an incitement

537
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,799
um

538
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,960
where is that line on what's improperly

539
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:49,840
vague

540
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,000
um even with a lot of guidance it

541
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,679
requires judgment and when we have

542
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,799
people from

543
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,240
all over the world with different

544
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,320
expertise different experiences in their

545
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,160
lives different concerns

546
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:03,919
um it it takes time to evaluate that

547
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
um but that doesn't mean that human

548
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,520
rights isn't working

549
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,520
i think it is still the guidepost that

550
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:10,960
gets us to the final

551
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,400
decisions great thanks for that

552
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:15,840
and you know by the way the lowest

553
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
hanging fruit in international

554
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,440
human rights research is complaining

555
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
about the ohchr

556
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:23,760
website so i just want to acknowledge

557
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,200
that that issue

558
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:28,000
so i want to take us sort of from this

559
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,480
this kind of opening of expectations and

560
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,840
surprises this has been

561
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,160
really great to hear sort of the path

562
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,919
that that you've all taken

563
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,039
um obviously you know the

564
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,480
the board is doing some really

565
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,160
interesting work i think

566
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,559
around content moderation in particular

567
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,160
like how the rules

568
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,240
actually apply to specific kinds of

569
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,600
content you know

570
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,400
whether it's you know insult and

571
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,520
bullying

572
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,880
or it's incitement or or something else

573
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,000
but of course and this is a kind of a

574
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,919
reflection on the recommendations

575
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,120
that the board has proposed over the

576
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,679
last

577
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,600
uh several months the the ecosystem

578
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,760
for information and rights online goes

579
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,679
beyond decision about what stays up and

580
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,039
what comes down

581
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,960
and the board has made some really

582
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,960
interesting recommendations

583
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,880
to facebook and and i just wanted to

584
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,280
highlight a few of the recommendations

585
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:25,200
from the from the trump uh

586
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,799
de-platforming case

587
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,600
um where the the board recommended for

588
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,640
example

589
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:34,160
more resources to to assess the risks

590
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:37,679
of particular content you made a

591
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,120
recommendation of the board

592
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,120
made recommendation that facebook should

593
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,880
review its contribution

594
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,919
to the narrative of electoral fraud

595
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,960
um in the united states focusing on and

596
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,080
the quote here

597
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,360
is design and policy choices and you

598
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,160
and the board also made a recommendation

599
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,320
that facebook develop and publish

600
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:02,000
policy that um uh that governs

601
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,440
facebook's responses

602
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,799
to crises so you're obviously moving

603
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,000
into this space that is well beyond

604
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,559
uh sort of the strict this content

605
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
should come up and this content should

606
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,159
stay down or this account

607
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,120
should be suspended or not and i think

608
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,320
that's very interesting

609
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:22,880
and i wanted to hear from you what you

610
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
expect from facebook

611
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
um in terms of its responses to your

612
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,320
recommendations

613
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,159
and whether you think and it's very

614
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,159
early i i mean i want to acknowledge

615
00:20:32,159 --> 00:20:32,880
that that

616
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,679
the trump case is actually a recent

617
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:37,440
decision of the oversight board so

618
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,360
you're probably still in the place of

619
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,039
waiting to hear what

620
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,280
facebook says but what do you expect

621
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,080
facebook

622
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,200
to do in response and um and

623
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,960
and have you have you felt that their

624
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,440
reaction so far have been positive maybe

625
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,159
start with unique

626
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,840
um yeah so uh david i guess

627
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:01,600
uh first of all i think the nature of um

628
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,760
you know cases that we have been looking

629
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,039
into uh

630
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:08,000
uh definitely it's a comp it's it's

631
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,720
complex

632
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:11,919
uh and uh and i think it also says a lot

633
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:12,559
the the

634
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,280
the the combination of board members

635
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,000
says a lot

636
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,760
about the diversity and you know the

637
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,520
kind of uh

638
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,480
you know like diverse sort of opinions

639
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,799
we have during our deliberations

640
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:27,039
uh but i would say that i think that's

641
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,240
also the beauty where

642
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,360
you know like uh we managed to tell each

643
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,960
other that there is a world

644
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,200
beyond the developed world and the first

645
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,240
amendment and

646
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,760
you know that we really need to look

647
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,240
into the other contests and the other

648
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
uh other jurisdictions and the laws that

649
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,520
you know like

650
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,400
people are not just fighting against the

651
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,720
tech giants policies but also their

652
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,400
local laws that are very very

653
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,720
problematic so you know they have like

654
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,880
repressive regimes and then repressive

655
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,640
policies by the tech giants

656
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:59,360
so i just wanted to say uh that around

657
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,799
the complex nature of

658
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:03,360
you know the decisions that we make but

659
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,640
at the same time i guess

660
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,320
um bored in its decisions

661
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:10,799
uh have made it clear you know their

662
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,240
binding decisions but then

663
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,200
we are you know giving recommendations

664
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,520
to

665
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,320
the company that these are the gaps that

666
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,360
they can look into

667
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,520
and and then you know to hold the

668
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:22,880
company accountable

669
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,120
we'll be very transparent in our annual

670
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,880
report that what they have done and what

671
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,480
they haven't done so far

672
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,799
so i think uh that's that's all i want

673
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:31,760
to say in terms of

674
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,520
recommendations but those

675
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,280
recommendations come

676
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,840
from you know like a diet comes from a

677
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,880
diverse

678
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,280
opinion of the panel members and those

679
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,120
opinions are not coming from just one

680
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,039
jurisdiction from several jurisdictions

681
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,640
and i think that's what something

682
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,559
makes it sometimes complex but also

683
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,840
sometimes you know like

684
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:53,039
uh to me it's very satisfying that uh we

685
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,200
also have like power in those panel

686
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,640
discussions where we can say

687
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,480
hold us at you know there is something

688
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,559
in my jurisdiction so you really need to

689
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,840
keep that in mind

690
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,520
while making a decision for something

691
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,600
very important

692
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,840
so i i want to stick with you here

693
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,440
because this is a really interesting

694
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,640
point that you're

695
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,679
making about local law and the pressures

696
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:16,799
that local law or national law can

697
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,360
impose

698
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,799
on users on the platform and um

699
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,720
i mean i'll hop back to the to the

700
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,919
bigger question

701
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,919
uh with mine in a second but but before

702
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,520
i move on to that

703
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,760
do you think so in a way asking you to

704
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
step outside of the oversight board

705
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,760
function in a way

706
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,760
but but not because there is this

707
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,120
recommendation

708
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,400
aspect to it what what do you think just

709
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,600
maybe even thinking about pakistan and

710
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,440
the distance of the company from

711
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,360
the lived experience of people in

712
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,440
pakistan particularly online

713
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,960
what what are the things that you want

714
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,919
to see so that the company is

715
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,400
more capable of observing human rights i

716
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
mean is it resources

717
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,039
is it better context is it more of a

718
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:05,120
presence in the leadership of facebook

719
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,679
what

720
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,720
what are those things um to your mind

721
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,360
i think david it's bits and pieces all

722
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,360
of these things you know i think it's a

723
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,080
lack of

724
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,960
uh willingness when it comes to these

725
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,400
jurisdictions uh

726
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,360
because as miners said it's a powerful

727
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:21,760
rich

728
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,520
company it's not that they don't have

729
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,279
resources it's not that they can

730
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:26,640
they cannot look into these

731
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,400
jurisdictions uh

732
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
because kovit is here it's i think it's

733
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,080
the willingness

734
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
and the will within the company that

735
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,200
needs to change

736
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,320
and if like removing the head of board

737
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,840
and a digital rights activist from

738
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:42,000
pakistan i think some of the things

739
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
that we have addressed in some of our

740
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,600
decisions are also looking into the

741
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,559
language

742
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,880
right so regional languages is something

743
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,799
that you know we have been pushing the

744
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:51,600
company

745
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
to look into not just facebook i i would

746
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,279
say like other companies

747
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,039
also but also at the same time when it

748
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,320
comes to local laws

749
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,039
speak to the users also what they do

750
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:03,200
basically they speak to the governments

751
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:06,159
and if the companies can find space to

752
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:07,039
speak to the

753
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:09,039
governments why they cannot you know

754
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,360
speak to the users of civil society

755
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,600
based in this jurisdiction i mean what

756
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,720
is hard in here

757
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,400
so i think these are the things that the

758
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,240
companies really especially

759
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,720
facebook really need to look into uh but

760
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,919
i would also say like

761
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,200
uh if if i put my board head i think

762
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
these are also the things we can also

763
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,279
you know like recommend in our decision

764
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,960
and then hold the company accountable at

765
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,640
the bigger level

766
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,640
yeah that's that's so interesting so let

767
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:36,799
me sort of pop back to that

768
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:39,840
point and ask mina um mine i i mean you

769
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,640
started off

770
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
by saying you know you have uh like

771
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,159
maybe to put it diplomatically um you

772
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,760
know you have some doubts about

773
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:50,240
about the company and some concerns

774
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,440
about it

775
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
and now we're seeing the oversight board

776
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,159
stepping into some of those spaces

777
00:25:56,159 --> 00:25:59,840
where i think your concern seems um

778
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,960
you know relevant um what how do you

779
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:06,400
feel so far about the conversation that

780
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,520
the board is having

781
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,240
with facebook obviously it's not sort of

782
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:12,640
an individual having a conversation with

783
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,760
a policy person at the company but are

784
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,240
are you sensing that the board is able

785
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,480
to move into this space and positively

786
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,520
influence

787
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,360
these kind of bigger questions about the

788
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,200
environment in which content decisions

789
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,600
are made

790
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,440
that's a great question i think i think

791
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:31,600
i think for me that the issue around

792
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,559
around the issue around the company is a

793
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,159
question of power how do we

794
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,000
how do those people who are powerless

795
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,159
address and hold accountable those who

796
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:41,120
have power

797
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,039
and so i think it's a natural

798
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:44,240
progression and i believe

799
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,600
human rights and maybe it's a very

800
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,720
different approach than traditional

801
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,600
human rights work

802
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,279
but i believe human rights the work of

803
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,760
human rights is to constantly expand the

804
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:52,400
boundaries

805
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,080
to hold accountable those who are in

806
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
power whether they're in government the

807
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:57,200
states or they're in corporates wherever

808
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,559
they are that's or whether they're even

809
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,080
the whole in the house which is why

810
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,000
which is why domestic violence and and

811
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,200
women's human rights issues are

812
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:03,919
important

813
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:05,360
how do we hold those wind power

814
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,960
accountable so whichever way it is

815
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,080
whether it's through

816
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,320
the content moderation or keep pushing

817
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,840
and saying you've got to put more

818
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,480
resources

819
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,120
into content moderation so it's not all

820
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:16,799
automation remember and remember as well

821
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,480
that as we go through this debate

822
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:22,159
is that that facebook is is registered

823
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,919
and incorporated in the united states of

824
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:26,720
america but 85 percent of its users are

825
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,320
outside north america

826
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,559
so how does it become so it is actually

827
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:33,200
more it's so it's got to figure out this

828
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,679
is it they're gonna be a us-based

829
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,039
us-based company

830
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,480
that's doing international work

831
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,159
international clients

832
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:41,520
or it's gonna be an international

833
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,279
company and held to international law so

834
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,880
i suppose all those things are going to

835
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,399
are going to happen i think and when you

836
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,240
hear us when you hear the board talking

837
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
about about uh

838
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
the the uh the third thing the third

839
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,240
recommendation about design

840
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,840
it's a question of us not we would like

841
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,760
to understand how those algorithms

842
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,360
work we just you know you know how to

843
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,880
say it how do they work because it may

844
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,960
help us in our work because

845
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
we as we bring oversight over the

846
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,640
content how do we know

847
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,399
how these algorithms work in and which

848
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:09,760
way and then of course

849
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
it's also the question about whether

850
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,120
facebook has got algorithms that

851
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,200
perpetuate division and stress and

852
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,960
incitement within there which we don't

853
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,520
know

854
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,200
so we asked the question are there any

855
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,559
is anything inside the company that

856
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,200
you're doing

857
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,000
that is driving this traffic towards

858
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,679
that that then leads to all the con

859
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:27,440
the crisis and issues that are being

860
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,440
raised against facebook so as a question

861
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,720
on discovery how do we move

862
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,480
this process forward and how do we have

863
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,000
much more transparency

864
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,679
within the company so everybody who's a

865
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,200
user not outside can actually

866
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,279
understand where the company is going so

867
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,480
and those are very legitimate human

868
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,919
rights concerns david they're not

869
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,000
they may not be within not seen as

870
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,840
traditional but they're very legitimate

871
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,600
human rights concerns

872
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,000
yeah and let me just ask you to follow

873
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,919
up on the the question of automation

874
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,480
and ai those are very i mean those are

875
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,440
complex

876
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,840
questions um and they're complex for

877
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,080
non-technologists and for technologists

878
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,200
themselves so i mean do you do you feel

879
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,159
that you're getting

880
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,440
when you're asking questions about about

881
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,080
algorithmic

882
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,200
recommendations or about what gets

883
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,559
surfaced or

884
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,200
as is really relevant in the context of

885
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,159
incitement

886
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:19,679
the reach the audience that is

887
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,880
attracted to and get and sees particular

888
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,480
content like how that all works

889
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,000
are you are you finding that you're

890
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,679
getting um

891
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:29,760
explanation from the company to help you

892
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,720
make those kinds of context decisions

893
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,640
i i think those those issues are still

894
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,240
ongoing it's still a work in progress we

895
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,760
haven't yet come to a point where we

896
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,279
we know exactly what's been given what's

897
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
not being given that process is ongoing

898
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:41,840
with the staff

899
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:45,200
that are looking at it so i can't really

900
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:45,600
answer

901
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,360
the question but i think that when we

902
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,120
come to the year end report you probably

903
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:49,760
will see

904
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,919
you will see um you will see a response

905
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:52,880
to that question

906
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,240
what has the company said what have

907
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,840
what's happened since then has it helped

908
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,039
us and we'll see whether that's happens

909
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,000
but right now it's

910
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,240
too early in the process to do that

911
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,440
great thanks

912
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,520
so taking this issue evelyn um

913
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,679
i want to ask you so still sticking with

914
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:09,679
this this broader

915
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:11,120
kind of approach that we see in the

916
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,799
recommendations i mean it does seem that

917
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:13,840
there's a kind of

918
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,000
bifurcation the decisions are very much

919
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,120
um you know kind of rooted in

920
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:24,159
the rules the bylaws the charter of

921
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:26,320
of the of the board and then the

922
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,159
recommendations which are permitted

923
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:30,480
of course under the bylaws allow you a

924
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,159
little bit more space

925
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:34,799
to um to expand so that you have a

926
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,320
better understanding of how this is all

927
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:37,200
working in this whole

928
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:40,559
ecosystem of of um of content moderation

929
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:41,120
and

930
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,640
of sort of content sharing and so forth

931
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,799
what is the argument or how do you see

932
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,480
these issues particularly maybe

933
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,960
the example of automation is a good one

934
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,720
how do you see automation as

935
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,279
a human rights issue like what what is

936
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:55,840
the

937
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,559
what is the argument in a way that that

938
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,600
the board

939
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:02,240
because of its remit should be paying

940
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,519
attention to

941
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:05,840
issues like automation even when you

942
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,679
know automation might not deal with a

943
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,600
particular kind of content or a

944
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,720
particular

945
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:13,039
post but it's a broader question what's

946
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,120
what's the argument for that being

947
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:18,399
within the human rights law framework

948
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,159
uh yeah sure i think um the argument was

949
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,240
was made in one of our opinions recently

950
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,200
that um

951
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:29,760
that analysis of of design of automation

952
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,519
is actually extremely relevant to the

953
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:34,000
board's um

954
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,080
human rights law analysis in terms of

955
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:37,120
you know we assess

956
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,880
what facebook is doing under the

957
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,799
legality test whether it's rules are

958
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:41,760
vague or not

959
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,600
whether they're imposing a restriction

960
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,960
for a legitimate public interest

961
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:45,760
objective

962
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:48,159
and then we look at necessity and part

963
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:49,760
of necessity is whether

964
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,799
um facebook is using the least intrusive

965
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,679
means

966
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,559
um to deal with a legitimate objective

967
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,080
to achieve a legitimate objective when

968
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,720
it when it

969
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:02,159
removes speech and the first step in

970
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:02,799
that

971
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,600
analysis of whether a speech removal is

972
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,120
the least intrusive means

973
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:10,080
is indeed how is it designed what is it

974
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:10,720
doing

975
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,799
that itself in its architecture that

976
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,000
maybe is causing

977
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:16,880
the problem or exacerbating the problem

978
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,960
and we explained we need to know

979
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,039
that information in order to assess if a

980
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,279
removal or other punishment

981
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:26,320
is um is the least intrusive means

982
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,279
to achieve an objective um just

983
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,720
harkening back to

984
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,720
state department days when we used to

985
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,760
look at that lens

986
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,640
for state action for governmental action

987
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:38,799
we often

988
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,559
took the position it was inappropriate

989
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,000
for governments to resort

990
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,159
to sensorial methods when they weren't

991
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:46,159
doing anything in their own

992
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:49,039
governance design to address issues of

993
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:49,679
for example

994
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,799
intolerance violence etc but they

995
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,159
immediately resorted to

996
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,840
to censoring before looking and seeing

997
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,159
what they could do um to deal with these

998
00:32:58,159 --> 00:32:58,799
issues

999
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,840
so it's it's an analogy um from from

1000
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,760
that time and um

1001
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,159
and uh and that's how the board has has

1002
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:08,880
phrased it in a recent opinion

1003
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,440
that's great thanks evelyn i i think

1004
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,840
that's really a nice articulation

1005
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
of a sort of the broader framework of

1006
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
human rights and how it how it plays out

1007
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,279
here

1008
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:22,159
let me ask sort of move us slightly into

1009
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:23,200
a different direction i want to

1010
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,080
emphasize

1011
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,799
anybody who is who is listening who's

1012
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,200
watching this panel please feel free

1013
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,399
to submit a question however

1014
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:34,000
we submit questions i can't really

1015
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,080
explain how that works but we will get

1016
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:37,679
the question i promise so if you have a

1017
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:38,000
question

1018
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,080
please do submit it so it can be part of

1019
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,360
our conversation

1020
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:45,120
um i want to go to um to an issue of

1021
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,279
sort of taking the oversight board

1022
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
experience and we may come back to some

1023
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,159
specifics about the

1024
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:53,279
about the board but i want to ask you

1025
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:54,720
ask you all sort of two separate

1026
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,480
questions um

1027
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,159
let me start with the first one which is

1028
00:33:58,159 --> 00:33:59,919
more specific to the oversight board and

1029
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:00,960
that is

1030
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,000
the um the nature of the interaction

1031
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,440
with facebook when you request

1032
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
information

1033
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,520
so you've you've done this a a few times

1034
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,440
i think you've asked for information and

1035
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,560
sometimes

1036
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,918
facebook the company will say no we

1037
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:16,719
can't

1038
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:19,119
we can't submit that kind of that kind

1039
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,000
of information

1040
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,079
or they'll make the argument that it's

1041
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,560
not relevant to your decision

1042
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,440
um how is that how has that worked out i

1043
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,719
mean is there any

1044
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,679
is there any sense that that you have

1045
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,399
that

1046
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:34,359
facebook given the fact that this is

1047
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:36,800
self-regulatory there's no outside court

1048
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,079
that's going to

1049
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,879
enforce any judgment the the whole

1050
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,199
system is designed on kind of this

1051
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,239
this good-faith process and commitment

1052
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,679
that the company has made

1053
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:50,000
to a certain extent is there a sense

1054
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,359
that you would like to

1055
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,560
the company to say more

1056
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,040
when you ask for information are you

1057
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,400
generally

1058
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,000
pretty um satisfied with the level of

1059
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,680
information the kind of information that

1060
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:04,560
you're getting

1061
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,640
from the company to help you make the

1062
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
decisions

1063
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,960
i realize it's kind of a sharp

1064
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,119
question in a certain way but you know i

1065
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,359
think the tenor of your discussion so

1066
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:16,960
far suggested that the board

1067
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,520
and you in particular you know are eager

1068
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:20,800
to push the company to

1069
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,960
to provide as much information so that

1070
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,160
you can make uh

1071
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,720
you know accurate uh accurate calls on

1072
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,599
these things

1073
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,440
i don't know if anybody wants to to jump

1074
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:33,440
in to answer that that question first

1075
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,240
evelyn is our professor so she's good at

1076
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,919
this so she can start us off

1077
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:46,720
mina thanks for volunteering me

1078
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:49,839
um so so i would say you know looking

1079
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,200
back at

1080
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:54,560
all our decisions we do um make clear

1081
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:57,760
in our opinions when we are um when

1082
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,520
facebook has not answered

1083
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:01,680
uh the questions and we try to be

1084
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,280
transparent about that that we

1085
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,599
asked for certain information and that

1086
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,520
they would not provide it or said it was

1087
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,400
irrelevant

1088
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,680
um etc so hopefully at least that

1089
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,520
transparency with the public

1090
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:16,720
um put some pressure on facebook to keep

1091
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,440
that

1092
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:20,880
information um coming hopefully in the

1093
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,760
future

1094
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:25,680
and we will certainly be issuing a um

1095
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:27,359
report in which we will discuss these

1096
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,280
issues um

1097
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:33,440
more in depth and

1098
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,760
you know in addition we have an

1099
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:36,640
implementation

1100
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,640
working team that is really looking at

1101
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,480
facebook to see when it's

1102
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,400
implementing and how it's doing its work

1103
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:44,079
um and and that too will be in the

1104
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,760
transparency report

1105
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,200
so you know i think you've hit on an

1106
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,599
important issue the the

1107
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,480
fact that facebook does not often um or

1108
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,000
always answer our questions

1109
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,920
um but that we are trying to be as

1110
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,320
transparent about that as as possible

1111
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,000
and and make sure the public knows when

1112
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,520
that happens um

1113
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,079
and and we'll be issuing more um formal

1114
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,200
views on that in a transparency report

1115
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,480
great that's great to hear

1116
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,520
yes a little bit i think the beauty of

1117
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,480
this experiment

1118
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:17,119
is that is that the reputation of

1119
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:17,760
facebook

1120
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:21,359
is is is is on at risk in terms of how

1121
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:22,880
it responds to the board and how it

1122
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,920
responds to us

1123
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,920
and our reputation as board members is

1124
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,440
at risk depending on how we work and how

1125
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,880
we don't decide and so

1126
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,240
it's kind of nice that even though

1127
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,760
there's no court that is going to make a

1128
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:33,440
decision beyond us there's

1129
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,359
there all these reputational risks that

1130
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:36,560
we are both in

1131
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:39,359
involved in which i think helps helps us

1132
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,280
and hopefully helps facebook

1133
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,640
you know become better at what it's

1134
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:44,800
doing because i see part of this the

1135
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,680
process of us

1136
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,079
is is us limiting and reducing

1137
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:49,440
facebook's power

1138
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,200
at least in content moderation and then

1139
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,280
in some other aspects

1140
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,000
that affect content moderation you can't

1141
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:57,520
you really can't talk about constant

1142
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,280
moderation or talk about algorithms and

1143
00:37:59,280 --> 00:37:59,760
how

1144
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,760
and how traffic is driven and how adds

1145
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,280
up you really can't at some point

1146
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,680
you'll have to get there so so i so i i

1147
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,880
think we're getting there it's again

1148
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:07,280
it's

1149
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
it's early days uh we will see how it

1150
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,800
goes in the next five

1151
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,160
seven years and see whether it's a

1152
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,839
useful experiment or not

1153
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,920
but it's been it's good in that sense

1154
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,280
because all of us

1155
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,200
at least i know members of the board who

1156
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,359
are i've really really careful about our

1157
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,720
reputations we don't want to go in and

1158
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,119
we

1159
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,320
can be swallowed in by this corporate uh

1160
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,079
giant and then we become we're told this

1161
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:30,000
has happened to us so we're all nervous

1162
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,280
about that but the other hand

1163
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:33,040
we want to do a good job but you don't

1164
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,720
want to be taken for for a fig leaf we

1165
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:35,200
don't

1166
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,560
want to be the fig leaves for this

1167
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,320
company no and so that's

1168
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,240
an interesting place where you're at

1169
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,560
yeah right

1170
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:45,599
that's really interesting and um i

1171
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:48,240
so you know we're we're friends we can

1172
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,839
pretend that like nobody's

1173
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:52,400
listening to us for for a moment um and

1174
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,240
i'll tell you what the question is

1175
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,880
in my mind and you could tell me how or

1176
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,240
whether you want to answer it

1177
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,480
um because it's a it's a kind of

1178
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,880
abstract question in a way

1179
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,920
you know your reputations matter

1180
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,760
um you're all and i don't think any of

1181
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:09,520
you have anything to worry about there

1182
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:10,440
you're all known as

1183
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,000
independent-minded human rights

1184
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,640
defenders and scholars

1185
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,440
is there something that you can imagine

1186
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:17,839
and if

1187
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:19,280
it doesn't have to be specific but is

1188
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,880
there a category

1189
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,079
of facebook response

1190
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:27,280
or category of facebook behavior

1191
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,520
that would really give you pause about

1192
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,280
staying on the board

1193
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
right because you you know what you've

1194
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,320
described and this is what you know we

1195
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
started with your expectations

1196
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:38,160
and things that were surprising and i

1197
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,359
thought it was very interesting to hear

1198
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:40,480
that you're all

1199
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,079
you all sort of joined this as an

1200
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:43,640
experiment to see if this

1201
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:45,440
self-regulatory model

1202
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,960
can work to restrain some of the um

1203
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,720
you know some of the activities of a

1204
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,800
company that have a pretty massive and

1205
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,760
often

1206
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,560
deleterious impact on human rights a

1207
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,720
negative impact on human rights

1208
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,079
are there is there something where you'd

1209
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:01,839
say you know what i think

1210
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:04,960
i think i've i'm gonna move on to to my

1211
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,680
other

1212
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,680
uh activities devote more time to other

1213
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
things and leave the board

1214
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,640
is there some is there like a category i

1215
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,640
mean it wouldn't be specific to

1216
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:15,839
a case but is there something that would

1217
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:17,119
would give you pause or that you think

1218
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:18,480
about i imagine you thought about that

1219
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:22,079
when deciding to join the board too

1220
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,839
anybody want to try to answer that

1221
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,240
question

1222
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,160
you know sometimes they they say david

1223
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,920
that you you you you'll know it when you

1224
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,880
see it you know

1225
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,240
but you know if you'll know it when you

1226
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,000
see it it's kind of hard to to explain

1227
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:36,720
what it would be

1228
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:39,760
but it would be perhaps a a decision by

1229
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:40,560
facebook

1230
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,480
or even by the board by the way that is

1231
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:43,920
so egregiously

1232
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:46,079
uh violating every the principles we

1233
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,680
have that it would make you know

1234
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,520
for quite a few people who thought that

1235
00:40:49,520 --> 00:40:51,520
the that the trump decision

1236
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:54,240
would was existential for for the board

1237
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,920
and and you know we had to what happened

1238
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,760
after that decision we had three days

1239
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:00,079
of of high of news and then it all

1240
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,440
filtered out and then now

1241
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,880
facebook has announced their decision

1242
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,800
two days of news it's filtered out so

1243
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,240
you know who knows what the issue will

1244
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,240
be that that is that's existential that

1245
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,280
makes you say okay

1246
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,720
that's it i don't know i mean you'll

1247
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,480
know where you'll see when you you you

1248
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,000
will know it when you see it i suppose

1249
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,520
it's the best way i can say

1250
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,560
yeah okay

1251
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:22,160
say david i think it's too early to uh

1252
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,839
you know like uh say something about an

1253
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,000
experiment i mean that's i mean at least

1254
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,280
that's how i

1255
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
you know decided to join the board uh

1256
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,640
keeping in mind that

1257
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,760
how long it can take to you know see the

1258
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,920
results of the decisions that we will

1259
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:38,880
make in the

1260
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,160
you know uh in the oversight board um so

1261
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:45,839
uh so yeah i i i think for me

1262
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:48,079
and even before the panel i we were

1263
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:48,960
talking about

1264
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:51,040
you know the whole process for me it's

1265
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,640
like

1266
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,800
learning about so many things you know

1267
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:55,760
like the

1268
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,920
the you know the police the

1269
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,480
discriminatory policies of the

1270
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,800
uh the company that i have been talking

1271
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,200
about for almost a decade now i mean i

1272
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,000
learned so

1273
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,720
much you know went into that around

1274
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,280
those policies values that we discussed

1275
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,760
even your reports you know the different

1276
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:15,280
aspects of

1277
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,440
the human rights framework that we

1278
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,920
discussed and then

1279
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,280
contextualizing those i mean even when

1280
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,000
you were

1281
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,920
you know producing reports we were also

1282
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,440
the ones from pakistan you know

1283
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,640
submitting our

1284
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:29,440
uh you know uh documents to you and

1285
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:31,040
bringing conversation into the

1286
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,359
i think that i think this is something

1287
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:34,720
that we are learning how to

1288
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:37,040
contextualize the international human

1289
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:38,240
rights framework

1290
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,560
and look beyond the you know like

1291
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,480
develop jurisdictions or

1292
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
let's say just you know like look beyond

1293
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,520
first amendment i would say

1294
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,119
that's great so let me let me um

1295
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:54,000
step to a slightly different kind of

1296
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:54,560
question

1297
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,960
and um you know you've all been talking

1298
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,160
about

1299
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,079
this self-regulatory we've been talking

1300
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,319
about the self-regulatory mechanism

1301
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:04,480
but there's this separate conversation

1302
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,240
actually conversations

1303
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,480
that are taking place worldwide right

1304
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:10,240
one question

1305
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:13,280
sort of focuses on regulation and you

1306
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,000
know we see

1307
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,880
like very active discussions about this

1308
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,200
whether we're talking about brussels or

1309
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,160
washington

1310
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,599
or delhi or islamabad i mean everywhere

1311
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:24,480
nairobi

1312
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:27,680
everywhere the discussion is around what

1313
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:30,480
regulation should be imposed in order to

1314
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,560
restrain or constrain

1315
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:34,720
facebook and the other large platforms

1316
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:35,920
meanwhile there's a separate

1317
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:36,880
conversation

1318
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,000
about other forms of oversight right

1319
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,079
somewhere in between the self-regulatory

1320
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:45,200
model and the cross-industry model

1321
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,520
and i wonder if like with these

1322
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:50,079
conversations taking place

1323
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:51,440
whether there are things that you're

1324
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:54,160
taking away from the oversight board

1325
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,440
that that that help you understand

1326
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:59,920
where it can fit in in these other

1327
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,520
conversations

1328
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,160
so maybe to ask it in a more specific

1329
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:06,240
way and evelyn i'll i'll start with you

1330
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,200
to ask you this question are there are

1331
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:10,880
there lessons that you're taking away

1332
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:12,400
from the oversight board

1333
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:15,599
that could apply to cross-industry

1334
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:17,599
oversight things like you know article

1335
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:18,640
19's

1336
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,400
social media council idea um or or to

1337
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,040
other

1338
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,440
kinds of ideas that draw from the

1339
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,200
example of press councils around the

1340
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,000
world

1341
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,440
are are there things that you're

1342
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:31,520
learning that you think would be

1343
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,119
applicable to that space

1344
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,760
and maybe even another way to put it is

1345
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:36,560
is there

1346
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,680
is there anything about this

1347
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,079
self-regulatory model that might

1348
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:41,680
actually interfere with

1349
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,960
those kinds of processes

1350
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:48,319
yeah thanks it's a it's a really

1351
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:50,560
interesting um question

1352
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,000
and i guess if i you know we're working

1353
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,079
on developing social media counsels

1354
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,480
um today some lessons that i might apply

1355
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,440
would be

1356
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:03,119
um it's useful if the

1357
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:06,000
pledge in advance to respect human

1358
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:08,240
rights law in their content moderation

1359
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,200
and conduct an internal audit to try to

1360
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,319
align themselves

1361
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,440
before joining um i think that

1362
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,839
that would be a very helpful

1363
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,920
launching pad for a social media council

1364
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,240
to have the companies that sign up

1365
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,160
make the pledge and make an attempt to

1366
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,880
align ahead of time

1367
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:32,480
in terms of uh lessons for

1368
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,920
maybe broader regulation um like this

1369
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
i mean i still see things through the

1370
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,359
lens of the un guiding principles on

1371
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,040
business and human rights so

1372
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:43,280
you know we're we're uh you know the

1373
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,119
second pillar of the company trying to

1374
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:46,000
respect human rights

1375
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,720
and creating a grievance mechanism but

1376
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,400
the first pillar of the un guiding

1377
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,760
principles is

1378
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,960
states regulating to

1379
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,319
protect people individuals from harms by

1380
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,000
other third parties right so that

1381
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,560
space for regulation is maintained in

1382
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:03,119
the u.n

1383
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:07,359
um guiding principles um and i guess

1384
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,400
the lesson i would draw from serving on

1385
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,160
the board is that i think a useful

1386
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:15,680
space for regulation is with respect to

1387
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:19,598
automated techniques algorithms

1388
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,760
at the very least more transparency

1389
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:23,760
about how companies collect personal

1390
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,440
data and monetize it

1391
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:28,160
and then deploy it i think that is a

1392
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,680
space very ripe for

1393
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:32,079
for regulation um when i see

1394
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:34,560
intermediary liability laws however

1395
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:37,119
that require you know 24-hour takedowns

1396
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:38,400
of of violent

1397
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:41,119
violative content that i think is a very

1398
00:46:41,119 --> 00:46:44,160
um dangerous space for regulation

1399
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,560
especially when i see the amount of work

1400
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:48,720
we put into deciding if something

1401
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,560
is hate speech that should be removed or

1402
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:52,319
not is incitement that should be removed

1403
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,200
or not

1404
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,079
i think placing that 24-hour 48-hour

1405
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,920
burden on on on companies

1406
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:00,880
is just gonna result in an overreach of

1407
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,359
um

1408
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,839
incentives to to take down too much so i

1409
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:04,640
guess those are my

1410
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:06,560
kind of initial lessons from you're on

1411
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,680
the board

1412
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,240
yeah that's great thank you uh mina can

1413
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,280
i ask you

1414
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,359
this question as well i mean when you in

1415
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:14,400
your initial

1416
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,119
response to my first question you you

1417
00:47:17,119 --> 00:47:18,960
identified regulation as something that

1418
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:19,839
you think

1419
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:21,680
should um should be taking place of

1420
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,520
course in in kenya

1421
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:25,599
there have been forms of regulation they

1422
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,880
tend to

1423
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:30,240
not be the most um say uh infused with

1424
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:31,920
human rights principles

1425
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,480
all the time um but there is a real

1426
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:35,599
demand

1427
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:38,000
in kenya's and elsewhere as elsewhere

1428
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,839
for real transparency

1429
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,800
do you do you see a kind of a role for

1430
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,400
the oversight board

1431
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,119
in in promoting good regulation is is

1432
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:48,160
this something that you're seeing

1433
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,559
develop as part of the conversation

1434
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:52,160
you know certainly the conversation

1435
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:53,760
outside of the u.s and europe

1436
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,000
are you seeing the conversation move in

1437
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:57,599
a helpful direction at least in part

1438
00:47:57,599 --> 00:47:59,040
because of what the oversight board is

1439
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,200
doing

1440
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:03,040
i think it's a bit early it's a bit

1441
00:48:03,040 --> 00:48:04,720
early to say that i think people are

1442
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,280
watching

1443
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,800
people are reading people are trying to

1444
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,480
figure out what what this

1445
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,240
animal called oversight board is really

1446
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:12,160
about is it a useful

1447
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,839
approach to is there a useful approach

1448
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:16,319
to try and and and emulate and spread

1449
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:17,200
across

1450
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,440
parts of the world um i think the the

1451
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,040
overreach is is the worrying thing about

1452
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:22,880
regulation always is overreach but then

1453
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,880
you the the other side of it is no

1454
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,559
regulation you have a mess so you

1455
00:48:26,559 --> 00:48:28,319
you've got to find that happy balance

1456
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:29,920
that exists i don't know i mean i think

1457
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:31,119
i think i think it's

1458
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:33,359
it's uh we where i come from i worry

1459
00:48:33,359 --> 00:48:34,319
about about

1460
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:36,079
overreach by the state you know and then

1461
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,000
when i see the us i worry about

1462
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,240
over you know there's too much space

1463
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,160
without any any regulation so

1464
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,079
how you that's the balance so i think

1465
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:45,839
just looking at it i think

1466
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,079
you know social media is is important

1467
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:49,040
and it's going to grow

1468
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:51,119
so we have got to find ways in which we

1469
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:52,480
have to grow with it in terms of

1470
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:54,079
regulation whether it's

1471
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:55,359
how do you do this human rights i

1472
00:48:55,359 --> 00:48:57,359
suppose if you ask me what is the one

1473
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:59,119
thing i would i would advise any

1474
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:00,720
any people coming anybody coming

1475
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:02,240
together is that they would

1476
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,480
have to read all of david k's reports on

1477
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,000
on

1478
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,400
on social media and freedom expression

1479
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:09,760
and try and implement them and use that

1480
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:11,680
as a guideline even beyond others

1481
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:13,280
but i think what what evelyn said as

1482
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,040
well is very important we've also got to

1483
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:15,599
look at

1484
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,200
surveillance the the surveillance

1485
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:18,960
capitalism that exists that's a

1486
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:19,920
fundamental i think

1487
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,079
if we don't touch surveillance

1488
00:49:22,079 --> 00:49:23,599
capitalism we're not touching

1489
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,359
much more you know so it's the center of

1490
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:28,079
it all and it's got to be addressed

1491
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,599
that i mean that's really interesting

1492
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,599
because of course um

1493
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,599
sort of the business model of the

1494
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,800
companies is not

1495
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:36,960
squarely within the oversight board's

1496
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:37,920
remit although

1497
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,000
again looking back at some of the

1498
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,280
recommendations

1499
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:44,000
um you're clearly uh thinking in that

1500
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:44,880
space so i

1501
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:46,960
that's that's really interesting i i

1502
00:49:46,960 --> 00:49:48,640
want to ask um negat

1503
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,880
a question that is is a little bit

1504
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:51,839
different from

1505
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,680
from this one around regulation although

1506
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,680
you're welcome to answer that one too

1507
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,800
but i want to ask you um so we probably

1508
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,119
i'm

1509
00:49:59,119 --> 00:50:01,119
i'm assuming we have quite a number of

1510
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:02,400
people uh

1511
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,319
in the on the panel who are watching the

1512
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:05,839
panel or listening

1513
00:50:05,839 --> 00:50:08,720
who are interested in you know how do

1514
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:10,720
they influence

1515
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:13,920
the the work of the oversight board and

1516
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:16,720
the board you know obviously in um i

1517
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,319
mean in the context of the trump trump

1518
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,559
case there was something like 9 000

1519
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,599
comments that were submitted um what

1520
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:27,040
what are the ways in which advocates

1521
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,240
can be most helpful in

1522
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:33,440
in working with or communicating with or

1523
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,680
providing their advocacy to the

1524
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:37,359
oversight board are you finding that

1525
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:38,839
there are certain kinds

1526
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:41,920
of techniques or

1527
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,800
substantive issues that outside

1528
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,880
advocates and scholars

1529
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,240
might be bringing to the board that are

1530
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,200
particularly helpful

1531
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,079
um yeah so david i would like to respond

1532
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,839
to your regulation question and

1533
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:58,160
and and also as a digital rights

1534
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,480
activist you know not as a board member

1535
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:03,359
i think uh uh lots of governments are

1536
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:04,960
coming up with the

1537
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,240
uh regulations um

1538
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,800
around regulating content internet in in

1539
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:12,640
their own jurisdictions and

1540
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:15,760
and pushing these companies to follow

1541
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,000
what they you know what they are making

1542
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,599
in terms of local laws

1543
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:21,680
and uh when it comes to board in our

1544
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,200
charter our scope is that

1545
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:26,640
you know uh local laws will supersede

1546
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:27,119
you know

1547
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:29,839
like our decisions so you see you we can

1548
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,880
we cannot really

1549
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:33,040
you know uh influence what the local

1550
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:34,720
laws say or cannot really go

1551
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,760
into that space at least for now and

1552
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:40,160
uh and i think that's where i see the

1553
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,440
role of you know

1554
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,079
uh different mechanisms different civil

1555
00:51:44,079 --> 00:51:46,000
society organization and tech companies

1556
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,839
as evelyn said that you know

1557
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,200
make a pledge what exactly they will

1558
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,200
they will be going to do when it comes

1559
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,480
to the governments where they have

1560
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,079
economic interest where they have

1561
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:56,960
political

1562
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,960
you know like influence like there is a

1563
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:00,880
political influence that you know can be

1564
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:01,680
used

1565
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,599
uh with the company especially in

1566
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:05,760
jurisdictions where there is a fear

1567
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,480
of you know blatant uh censorship and

1568
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:10,160
blocking of these platforms

1569
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,960
so i really think that platforms tech

1570
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,559
giants not just facebook all of them

1571
00:52:14,559 --> 00:52:16,160
really need to think through

1572
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,920
how they are going to respond to these

1573
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:20,079
regulation regime that is

1574
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:22,640
uh coming up uh and uh it's being

1575
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:24,559
discussed in in different jurisdictions

1576
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:26,480
i can say in pakistan and india that is

1577
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,119
the

1578
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:30,480
hot debate at the moment uh but to your

1579
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:33,760
uh second question which i forgot uh

1580
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,839
well actually before before we get to

1581
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,280
the second question then

1582
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,520
let me let me follow up with this point

1583
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,960
that you're making because

1584
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,480
i think you're making a really important

1585
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,160
one and you know earlier you

1586
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,040
you also talked about local law so local

1587
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:47,520
law

1588
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,760
regulation i mean we might when we say

1589
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:50,880
regulation

1590
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,960
it might give give the sense that oh

1591
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,400
it's all within this rule of law

1592
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:56,160
framework and it's just about

1593
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:58,960
providing democratic accountability for

1594
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,000
the companies

1595
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,240
which would be great but you're also

1596
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:03,599
talking about

1597
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,160
you know the real kind of pressure that

1598
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:08,160
local law that governments are putting

1599
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:09,680
and not just through law but through

1600
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,960
extra legal

1601
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,440
mechanisms which you know as well as

1602
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:14,319
anybody

1603
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,440
so given that like what what do you see

1604
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,119
as the space

1605
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:22,480
for the oversight board to actually

1606
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:25,920
improve the way the companies deal with

1607
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:27,200
those

1608
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:29,920
legal pressures from governments so you

1609
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:30,720
know it's

1610
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,640
it's one of those spaces that i think

1611
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:34,400
the company itself says that's outside

1612
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,359
your remit

1613
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:38,240
and yet you know as we see in india for

1614
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,559
example over the last couple of months

1615
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,640
you know demands from governments are

1616
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:43,599
extremely

1617
00:53:43,599 --> 00:53:46,240
consequential for public debate and it

1618
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,319
puts the company in a position of

1619
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,440
well how do we respond so how do you how

1620
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,280
do you see the oversight board

1621
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:56,400
in this kind of complex

1622
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,839
dynamic between the state the individual

1623
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:03,119
and the company so david i guess

1624
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:05,920
uh we uh we really shouldn't expect

1625
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:06,800
everything

1626
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:08,720
to from the oversight board to respond

1627
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:11,440
like the company companies have

1628
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:14,079
lots of issues and and i think oversight

1629
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:14,880
board

1630
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,640
uh has been established to address

1631
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,319
content moderation when it comes to

1632
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:20,480
states and local laws i think companies

1633
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:21,839
also really need to

1634
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,520
figure out you know like how they are

1635
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,359
going to respond because they have

1636
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:27,680
an obligation under the you know uh

1637
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,440
international law as well

1638
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:32,640
uh oversight board is giving you know

1639
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,280
uh besides the binding decisions uh that

1640
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,240
they are making they

1641
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:38,880
are giving recommendations uh in the

1642
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:39,760
policy

1643
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:41,920
guidelines uh and i think that's

1644
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,440
something that

1645
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:45,680
advocates and civil society organization

1646
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:47,599
really need to look into the nitty

1647
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:49,119
gritty of the decisions that we are

1648
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,720
making because we are putting a lot of

1649
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,520
labor

1650
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,839
into writing those decisions and and

1651
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:55,839
then looking into different aspects of

1652
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,680
the international human rights framework

1653
00:54:57,680 --> 00:54:59,280
so i'm not sure if i have responded to

1654
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,880
your question but

1655
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,599
but but at least that's how i see this

1656
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:04,799
well i know you have

1657
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:07,040
absolutely responded to it i guess you

1658
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,119
know it one way of thinking about

1659
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,400
local law and governmental pressure

1660
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,520
is also as a form of content moderation

1661
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,839
right and and the companies have a

1662
00:55:17,839 --> 00:55:19,599
couple of different responses to that i

1663
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:20,000
mean one

1664
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,559
response that that we've seen in some

1665
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:23,920
places is

1666
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:26,079
the the company will essentially

1667
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:28,079
integrate into their terms of service

1668
00:55:28,079 --> 00:55:29,520
and their rules

1669
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,400
the uh the local law so that it looks

1670
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,319
like the company is actually doing its

1671
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:34,880
own

1672
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:37,760
kind of self-governance but in fact it's

1673
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,880
implementing

1674
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:42,079
government policy and um i'm not sure if

1675
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,520
there's a question that follows from

1676
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,520
this although mina you raised regulation

1677
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,400
earlier i wonder if you can imagine you

1678
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,920
know a space where you're actually

1679
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:50,319
having

1680
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,559
influence um sort of assessing

1681
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:57,839
that dynamic itself

1682
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,119
that is one of the hardest things david

1683
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:02,880
that i suppose not even for us not for

1684
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:04,400
the oversight board but i suppose what

1685
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:06,319
goes on for everybody who's pushing

1686
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:07,760
for for human rights and freedom of

1687
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:10,160
expression across across the world

1688
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:12,720
you know how do how do you how does a

1689
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:13,920
company deal with

1690
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:16,720
a government an authority that is

1691
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:17,680
demanding

1692
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:19,440
that anything that's that is critical of

1693
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:21,200
government be pulled out and how do you

1694
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,160
deal with it

1695
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,559
and and does the oversight board does

1696
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:25,680
the work of the oversight board

1697
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,760
influence have any influence at all

1698
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,960
you know you would hope so you would

1699
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,359
hope that activists will be exciting and

1700
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:32,880
say look let's use the oversight board

1701
00:56:32,880 --> 00:56:33,599
as our

1702
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:35,760
moderator as opposed to using government

1703
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,599
uh operations

1704
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,520
and and and you know and and and

1705
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,200
sometimes the times the companies

1706
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:42,960
succumb we've seen that happening in

1707
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:44,799
in india as you say and sometimes in

1708
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,400
turkey where the companies are

1709
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,040
are succumbing to the to the authorities

1710
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,559
so you know i think i think this

1711
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:52,799
this battle this uh struggle this

1712
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:53,680
contestation

1713
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:56,240
between the state authoritarian states

1714
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:56,880
and

1715
00:56:56,880 --> 00:57:00,079
and and freedom of expression written

1716
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:01,200
large not even just

1717
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,119
not just on the platforms will continue

1718
00:57:03,119 --> 00:57:04,240
and it's been going on

1719
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,720
for years even in the before social

1720
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:08,240
media with mainstream media

1721
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:10,240
when governments would order newspapers

1722
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,920
and radio to say certain things so i

1723
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,960
suppose this is

1724
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:14,880
so this is where they start the struggle

1725
00:57:14,880 --> 00:57:16,720
will continue the conversation continues

1726
00:57:16,720 --> 00:57:17,760
i don't think it's any

1727
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:20,720
different from that and it's and what is

1728
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,760
painful is when

1729
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,640
the social media companies just roll

1730
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:25,119
over

1731
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:26,640
and accept and then and there's no

1732
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,240
discussion there's no transparency

1733
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,760
sometimes it's even good for them to say

1734
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:31,119
look we have been asked by the

1735
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:33,520
government of the united states to drop

1736
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,040
all these things it's much better to say

1737
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,319
that and then people can have their own

1738
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:36,880
debate

1739
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:40,000
it may help move that discussion forward

1740
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,720
that's great so um we've only got two

1741
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:43,839
minutes left

1742
00:57:43,839 --> 00:57:45,520
and then i think we just go dark and i

1743
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:46,559
think that just happens like

1744
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,319
automatically mid-sentence

1745
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,280
so um so i want to conclude with the the

1746
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:52,960
question the last question that i was

1747
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:54,640
asking you god and it's really just a

1748
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,400
straightforward question as to

1749
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,440
what kind of advocacy what kind of

1750
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,680
input may not even be advocacy but what

1751
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:02,720
kind of input

1752
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:05,280
would be most useful to you as board

1753
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:07,119
members moving forward i mean you do

1754
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:08,000
have this

1755
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:10,720
there's a sense you're not a court but

1756
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,640
you have some of the bells and whistles

1757
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:15,200
of of a court in the sense that you you

1758
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,799
have an interaction with

1759
00:58:16,799 --> 00:58:19,920
the bull with uh you know other uh

1760
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,680
panelists you have interaction with the

1761
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,680
company with individuals who make

1762
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:24,559
submissions

1763
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:26,720
what what should um what should

1764
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,240
advocates be thinking and you've only

1765
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,119
got like

1766
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,480
you know 20 seconds to to give a

1767
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:34,640
like here's what we need from civil

1768
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:36,319
society in in our in

1769
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:38,559
in their input i know evelyn if you want

1770
00:58:38,559 --> 00:58:40,160
to start with that

1771
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,280
sure i mean i would i would say please

1772
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,960
participate in the public

1773
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:47,359
comments process for each decision uh

1774
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,559
that that we face

1775
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,520
it's hugely helpful um to be able to see

1776
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:53,599
what a range of experts and individuals

1777
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:54,559
are thinking

1778
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:57,280
and people now know and are familiar

1779
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,119
with our template how we write our

1780
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:00,079
opinions

1781
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,319
so plugging into those issues that you

1782
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,480
know we will have to decide

1783
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,559
for a particular case based on how we

1784
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:08,079
write the opinions how we evaluate the

1785
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,520
human rights aspects

1786
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:12,960
is great and on a more um maybe

1787
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,720
a detailed scale i would say for civil

1788
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,559
society actors that really follow these

1789
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:17,359
issues

1790
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,160
i think you really need to um make room

1791
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,359
in your point of contact

1792
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,240
portfolio right um to handle this

1793
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:25,760
because it's kind of a growing part of

1794
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,520
the portfolio that can

1795
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,359
you know overwhelm one person so i would

1796
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:30,880
say be thinking

1797
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,559
strategically about how to be a

1798
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:34,319
consistent participator

1799
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,880
in our public comments process thanks

1800
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,440
evelyn

1801
00:59:37,440 --> 00:59:39,599
at negan mina just like a quick word

1802
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:41,200
before we go dark here

1803
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,200
yeah actually what evelyn said but we

1804
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,200
need more contribution from global south

1805
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,520
from our own jurisdictions

1806
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:50,079
great thanks and minor i have nothing

1807
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:50,640
more and

1808
00:59:50,640 --> 00:59:52,079
not nothing further to add i think

1809
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:53,760
negative said oh we just need much more

1810
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,680
people more people from the global south

1811
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,480
participating raising questions being as

1812
00:59:58,480 --> 00:59:59,440
critical of us

1813
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:00,799
as as we expect i think the more

1814
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,720
criticisms we have the better it is for

1815
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,200
the board

1816
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,640
to be honest that's a fantastic uh

1817
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,599
point to to end on here evelyn might

1818
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,480
