4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,320

my name is supriya sharma i'm the

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,000
executive editor of

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,399
scroll dot in one of india's independent

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,840
news websites

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,360
that the government now wants to

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,800
regulate through new sweeping

18
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,559
information technology rules

19
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,800
that have caused such consternation that

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,559
can you believe it facebook has sued the

21
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:58,719
indian government over privacy

22
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,719
what we're seeing in philippines and in

23
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,320
india is of course part of a larger

24
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,879
battle over information that's unfolding

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,360
across the world and mario you've been

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,320
right in the thick of

27
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,760
it you were among the first to point out

28
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:12,000
how

29
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,320
silicon valley companies in their search

30
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,600
for profits

31
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,520
were enabling the rise of populist

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,680
leaders and authoritarian governments

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,360
and the film brings that out very

34
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
powerfully i wanted to start where the

35
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,080
film

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,439
ends which is in the second half of 2020

37
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,159
when president duterte issued a threat

38
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
to facebook

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,000
because of an investigation that rappler

40
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:34,960
did

41
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
tell us more about that mario what did

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,640
it take to get facebook to act against

43
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,680
those accounts

44
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,240
so a lot but it wasn't i think it's

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,399
called enlightened self-interest right

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:46,880
we've

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,360
been we are one of two filipino

48
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,680
fact-checking partners of facebook

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,240
and we started pointing out the problems

50
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,680
in 2016

51
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
because that was the time when we came

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,719
out with this

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
weaponization of the internet series

54
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,799
three-part series i wrote two of the

55
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,680
three parts

56
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,600
and the second part the one of the

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,719
pieces i wrote

58
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,598
talked about how facebook algorithms

59
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,920
impact democracy we could see it then

60
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
i had given that data to facebook right

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,120
uh in this last one i gotta say

62
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,440
you know we know the people we know

63
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,319
exactly

64
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,760
what happened about a year before the

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,760
takedown this is the fourth takedown

66
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,280
that that facebook has done in the

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,360
philippines since 2018.

68
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,879
um we noticed that

69
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,000
government agencies the police the

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:36,879
military

71
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,800
were targeting uh progressive voices

72
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,720
and it's it's like our version of

73
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,120
mccarthyism but they call it

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,160
red tagging red communist right so

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,640
they were red tagging journalists human

76
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,519
rights activists

77
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
opposition politicians and that is

78
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,519
dangerous at a time when there's an

79
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:58,959
anti-terror law where you can be a small

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,879
group of cabinet secretaries can declare

81
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:01,920
you a terrorist

82
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
and then you can be arrested without a

83
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,159
warrant and held for up to 24 days

84
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
so it's quite dangerous at that time so

85
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:09,440
ah

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,599
what we saw what we saw were networks

87
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,440
disinformation networks that were

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,159
targeting

89
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,040
we gave that we did stories and then

90
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,239
gave it to facebook and

91
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,440
what was interesting with their

92
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,760
september 22

93
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,640
2020 takedown is that they took down two

94
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,480
networks one was domestic

95
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,879
this one that we had we had pegged and

96
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,799
they went a step further by

97
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,879
pointing out that there were military

98
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:33,920
officials

99
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,360
that were actually and military accounts

100
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:37,599
masquerading

101
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,239
as human rights activists right so here

102
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,400
you see the duplicity they exposed

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,159
uh but the second one was even more

104
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,400
interesting because it was

105
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,440
influence operations from china

106
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,519
and it was targeting all of southeast

107
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,439
asia but it was most successful

108
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
in the philippines where it was

109
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,640
campaigning

110
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,200
for the daughter of president duterte

111
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,080
for our may

112
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:03,280
2022 elections i.e next year right so it

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,120
was already campaigning for that

114
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,519
it was attacking me i guess i'm a little

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,360
favorite of theirs but that's

116
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,120
fascinating that campaigning for a

117
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
duterte and attacking a journalist

118
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,320
and then the other thing it did was to

119
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
create fake accounts

120
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,839
using ai generated photos for the us

121
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,880
presidential elections so these two

122
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,880
were taken down by facebook so you can

123
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,320
kind of see

124
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,240
global the global power dynamics playing

125
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:32,880
out

126
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,040
in these influence operations

127
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,680
so what happened next i mean facebook

128
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,680
took down the account president duterte

129
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,639
issued a threat

130
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,400
what have the last few months been like

131
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,400
have things turned a bit frosty between

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,919
the president and facebook or not

133
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
not yet i think in the philippines

134
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:52,720
facebook is in the

135
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,240
phase of docking right i mean in a way

136
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,919
journalists deal with this all the time

137
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,560
right we hold power to account and we

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
know we are going to get clobbered in

139
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,479
the time before social media

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:06,400
uh this is you know we know how to

141
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,919
handle that and you know you have to

142
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,919
speak truth to power which is also part

143
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:11,120
of the reason

144
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,400
i kind of laugh at the at the new

145
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,639
definitions that the social media

146
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,520
platforms

147
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,400
are giving editorial decisions because

148
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
make no mistake about

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,960
it what they call content moderation is

150
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,280
just

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
kind of renaming what journalists used

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,720
to do

153
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,479
which is to gatekeep the public's fear

154
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:35,440
and you know of course well anyway i'll

155
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,039
shut up and just say you know

156
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
they got a little bit of what we get uh

157
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,280
every day um i think that you know it's

158
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,080
sobering

159
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,680
to know to to feel that um

160
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,160
but not much beyond that i think you

161
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,320
know the danger is there and my biggest

162
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:52,960
worry

163
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:56,160
is the may 2022 elections because

164
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,280
if facebook doesn't significantly change

165
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,600
if guard rails aren't put in place then

166
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,800
i i don't

167
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,120
imagine i can't imagine how we will have

168
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:07,120
integrity of elections

169
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,720
which is what i wanted to ask you are

170
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,560
you seeing any of the election integrity

171
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,240
initiatives that were put in place

172
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,000
last year in the united states which by

173
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,880
the way we've not seen in india yet

174
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
yes absolutely no same as you right i

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,000
think

176
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,319
india and the philippines share a lot of

177
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,160
have a lot of things in common

178
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
i mean thank you for the chat we had

179
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,960
right before this right uh

180
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,080
populist governments who use

181
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,919
the social media platforms to

182
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,319
insidiously manipulate people to make

183
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:36,639
you

184
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,919
distrust everything so it makes civic

185
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:40,720
engagement

186
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,960
impossible and the voice with the

187
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,400
loudest megaphone

188
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,960
controls the public sphere this is

189
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,160
whether knowingly or

190
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,400
unknowingly what facebook and social

191
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,680
media platforms have done

192
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,520
globally right and that's part of the

193
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,880
reason that you know from

194
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,080
2017 when freedomhouse.org you would

195
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,440
have heard this from me in the film you

196
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,599
know they said there were 27 countries

197
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:02,479
around the world

198
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,240
where cheap armies on social media is

199
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,680
rolling back democracy

200
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,080
to january this year at the oxford

201
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,840
computational propaganda

202
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,639
research that they came out with 81

203
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,280
countries

204
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,560
so 27 to 81 and you know

205
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,919
this is murder genocide in some of the

206
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,759
countries in the global south

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,560
uh there have been of course myanmar

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,960
that's your best thing what we've seen

209
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,160
happen in february in myanmar yes

210
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,720
facebook took resources and put it in

211
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,520
the myanmar

212
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,400
elections but here's the thing when the

213
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,080
virus of lies

214
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,680
hits real people it changes the way they

215
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,800
view the world

216
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,759
and our own cognitive biases make it

217
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,240
very

218
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,479
difficult to go back to where it was and

219
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
i think this is the

220
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,879
biggest problem we have not discussed is

221
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
what do you do with emergent behavior

222
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,199
right when when you get a mass of people

223
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,199
there's more than three billion on

224
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,960
facebook alone the accounts that are

225
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:03,599
there

226
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,080
they behave very differently from an

227
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,199
individual

228
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,160
and that pressure exerts the individuals

229
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:11,919
do things that they would not normally

230
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:12,240
do

231
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,240
every psychological study has shown us

232
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,560
this the solomon ash studies

233
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,639
you know the the six degrees of

234
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:20,400
influence rule that has now

235
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,680
on facebook gone down to 3.5 degrees of

236
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,960
influence right

237
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,199
so so what i worry about is is how

238
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:32,399
the way the medium delivering the news

239
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,360
the world's largest distributor of news

240
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:38,559
is actually shaping human behavior

241
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,958
and until someone takes responsibility

242
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,360
for that i worry about our future

243
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,920
not just democracy our own future right

244
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
like as human beings and

245
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,080
and free and having free will and the

246
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,040
agency to choose our destiny

247
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,480
yeah well um i was i was hoping to hear

248
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,760
that in the last few months you're

249
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,959
seeing some changes

250
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,760
that are sort of more than that one

251
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,240
action that facebook took in philippines

252
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160
um but you know elsewhere in the world

253
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,959
maria we're seeing that this rather cozy

254
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:11,040
relationship between the platforms

255
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,640
and governments is sort of fraying a bit

256
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
you know twitter was banned in nigeria a

257
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,240
few days ago

258
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,839
in india the police landed up at

259
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,680
twitter's offices

260
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,720
in turkey as well with friction over new

261
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,240
rules and as i mentioned

262
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,040
in india facebook rather whatsapp which

263
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
is owned by facebook has sued the

264
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,440
government over these new rules

265
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,000
um do you think something is is kind of

266
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,720
shifting

267
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,080
slowly but steadily where the uh you

268
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:40,560
know

269
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,560
big tech has woken up to the fact that

270
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,880
the authoritarians that they enable

271
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,080
can finally turn on them

272
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,200
i wish it was that clear but i i think

273
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,120
what has been most effective

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,440
has been public pressure right there

275
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,000
were and look they haven't even really

276
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:58,480
worked

277
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
right look at the stop hate for profit

278
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,800
july last year in the united states

279
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,399
facebook didn't feel it

280
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,600
um last year uh the net income of

281
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,079
facebook was still a very very healthy

282
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,360
29 billion dollars the incentive

283
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:15,920
scheme of surveillance capitalism is

284
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,040
still there but

285
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,680
the good side is i think they're

286
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,680
starting to realize

287
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,120
that speaking truth to power has cost

288
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,560
and i think this is the difference

289
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,760
between having journalists with a sense

290
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,440
with standards and ethics with the

291
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
mission of journalism

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,160
being the gatekeepers versus tech

293
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,839
companies who are run

294
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
by people whose incentive is

295
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
more shareholder value right ultimately

296
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:44,880
i hope

297
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,160
because in the short term if we continue

298
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,920
this incentive scheme

299
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,519
we will continue and deepen the dystopia

300
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,200
the entire world is in

301
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,320
it will enable a rise of fascism

302
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,360
globally we have

303
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,160
already seen this and your country and

304
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:02,560
mine

305
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:05,839
i mean i i covered

306
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,120
look i remember 2004 when modi like

307
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:11,440
duterte was facing charges of human

308
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,560
rights violations

309
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:16,000
and then 2014 when he became

310
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,480
this wasn't this is a while ago right

311
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,640
2014 when he became your prime minister

312
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,240
here president duterte

313
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,600
a mayor in in power in davao city since

314
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,880
1988

315
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:29,600
and then he takes power with the help of

316
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,640
facebook

317
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,800
um in 2016. and so i guess

318
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,880
it's existential and certainly for the

319
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,680
philippines the may 2022 elections

320
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,760
given that president duterte's daughter

321
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,760
sarah duterte looks like she's running

322
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,800
for office

323
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,560
isn't that interesting that chinese

324
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,480
influence operations were already

325
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,240
campaigning for her right

326
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,320
i'm hoping that there is greater

327
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,440
transparency

328
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,639
that the social media platforms uh open

329
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,040
up

330
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,320
and you know moderate the greed

331
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,440
take some real leadership and and

332
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,560
and show us a mirror of humanity so that

333
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
we prevent the worst

334
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,279
of what human beings can do to ourselves

335
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,959
supreme you know that i always think

336
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,639
about that time period

337
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:18,079
post-world war ii after the atom bomb

338
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,160
and it was the united states that did it

339
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,880
but when when we saw the

340
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,560
the the heart of darkness

341
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,519
when we saw that the world came together

342
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,279
to try to prevent it from happening

343
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:31,920
again

344
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,440
this is the same type of moment

345
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,760
and the global institutions the united

346
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,720
nations

347
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,920
governance is weakened

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,959
and isn't functioning so this is this is

349
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:46,720
really a call to arms

350
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,760
for those who have power to look at the

351
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,120
world again

352
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,160
and to create a better world because the

353
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,279
world that was

354
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,480
is gone and there's something very

355
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,000
new and and painfully

356
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,920
it's a dystopian world that is being

357
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,120
created now

358
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,519
we either go with it or we make it

359
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,440
better

360
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,800
you know mario i've been thinking that

361
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,720
even the small steps that we're seeing

362
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,560
the platforms take how much of that is

363
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,000
just the trump effect

364
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,440
you know the crisis in american

365
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,320
democracy forcing them to acknowledge

366
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,680
their role and take some

367
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,920
corrective actions and i wonder now with

368
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,800
trump on

369
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,880
is the pressure this public pressure

370
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
that you speak of is that going to

371
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,320
slacken because you know they've never

372
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,480
really bothered about

373
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,880
what those of us in asia have to say as

374
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:35,680
much as they do

375
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,160
for the united states asian lives don't

376
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,160
matter

377
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,040
yeah isn't that horrible that we're the

378
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,880
ones saying that but that's certainly

379
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:45,760
what their

380
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,560
behavior has shown right i mean look the

381
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,360
announcement

382
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,240
last friday was it only last friday that

383
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,800
you know trump would be off the platform

384
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,839
for a period for another two years

385
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,440
right uh for two years even that

386
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,399
had this announcement that facebook was

387
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:04,720
not

388
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:08,720
responsible for for january 6

389
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:11,600
for the violence that erupted on capitol

390
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,000
at the capitol on january 6. well

391
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,040
you know if you go back and i do go back

392
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,720
facebook in 2012 actually did a study

393
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,839
on the role of emotional contagion on

394
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
its platform

395
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
and the results of that study said

396
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,120
that the network spreads back which is

397
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:31,680
seated

398
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,199
it spreads emotions so if anger

399
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,519
and hate are the emotions that are most

400
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:40,000
amplified right this is now proven by

401
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
study after study

402
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,720
lies laced with anger and hate spread

403
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,399
faster and further

404
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,040
than facts on social media right if that

405
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,480
is the case

406
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,600
then i think

407
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,600
i don't see that the announcements

408
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,320
the palliative measures the too little

409
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,279
too late like

410
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,360
it's great you know to take to take

411
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,320
to be proud of taking trump off or to

412
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,279
sheepishly

413
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,120
admit that they can take a powerful

414
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,760
figure off is frankly way too little too

415
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,360
late and should never even

416
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,839
have gotten to the point where any

417
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:19,040
leader around the world

418
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,519
can lie repeatedly to their

419
00:15:22,519 --> 00:15:24,560
constituencies right it isn't

420
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,639
everything is slightly twisted when it

421
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:29,040
comes to interpretations of free speech

422
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
and not surprisingly they're slightly

423
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,320
twisted

424
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,880
to help protect the business model that

425
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:37,839
has been harmful to its users

426
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
as facebook or twitter have they

427
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
moderated political like speech by

428
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,839
politicians in philippines at all

429
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,560
no no no but and and i think it's

430
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
interesting right like i'm going back

431
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,759
because i'm i'm writing a book and i

432
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,320
think it's interesting that uh

433
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,880
that they've separated into two the

434
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,160
political

435
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,560
uh disinformation networks from the

436
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,120
commercial disinformation networks but

437
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:06,560
you know like when you cover the rise of

438
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,519
terrorism

439
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:09,600
and social networks physical social

440
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
networks of terrorism

441
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,240
they are hand in hand these come up

442
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,800
because politicians need them and they

443
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,120
these gain greater power so for example

444
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,360
the rise of terrorism in southeast asia

445
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,959
began in 1988

446
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:24,959
when osama bin laden sent his

447
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,360
brother-in-law muhammad jamal khalifa to

448
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,560
the philippines

449
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,040
to actually begin the financial network

450
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,360
that underpin the terror attacks that

451
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:33,680
were

452
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,920
co-opted by al-qaeda at that point it

453
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,600
was it wasn't al qaeda yet

454
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,839
right so i'm just saying we know this

455
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:40,720
already so

456
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:45,040
why are we pretending not to know it

457
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:48,480
absolutely um yet you know maria for all

458
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,000
the problems with the platforms and

459
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,279
they're plenty

460
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,120
they're also powerful instruments that

461
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,320
give voice to journalists and citizens

462
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,759
yeah absolutely both rapper and scroll

463
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:01,440
are digital natives we built our

464
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,279
audiences here

465
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:07,039
in fact in india at least

466
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,640
you know with the mainstream media

467
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,880
entirely towing the government line

468
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,199
um in fact sections of it even turning

469
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,439
into disinformation machines

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,000
in the worst case spewing hate against

471
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,199
minorities

472
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:21,119
the platforms really seem like the last

473
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
available space for independent

474
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,760
journalism

475
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,199
and for critical voices and you know

476
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,520
so it's that even as we're trying to get

477
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,039
the platforms to clamp down

478
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,840
on disinformation and hate speech

479
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:34,640
there's also

480
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,880
an attempt to get them to not buckle

481
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,559
under government pressure to close down

482
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,400
legitimate accounts

483
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,160
um is that something that you're seeing

484
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
in the philippines as well

485
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,400
yeah absolutely and guess what news

486
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,640
organizations have dealt with that power

487
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
dynamic

488
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,039
for for decades right we know how to do

489
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,160
this so i guess

490
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
part of it is that look uh

491
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:00,160
we are we're all familiar with in 2011

492
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:00,720
with how

493
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,320
social media was really uh credited with

494
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,400
the arab spring which then became the

495
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,000
arab winter because

496
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,400
after the students and the activists use

497
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:12,320
social media here came government to

498
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,520
exploit it

499
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,600
and i think the social media platforms

500
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,120
weren't prepared for that

501
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
and this is you know it took until 2015

502
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,039
when i peg it to instant articles

503
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,120
bringing in news organizations

504
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,559
and then when we came on board the same

505
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:29,919
algorithms

506
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,039
were used to like for a story on the

507
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:34,559
scroll story and rappler and the new

508
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,320
york times on bbc

509
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,919
for distribution as the joke

510
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,960
that this guy told at dinner or the lie

511
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,880
that another neighbor is saying and

512
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,080
guess what

513
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,440
the algorithms again by design

514
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,400
actually promote the greatest use and

515
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,600
how do you do that

516
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,640
by anger unfortunately right because the

517
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,120
top

518
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,440
rapper has a mood meter and what we know

519
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,160
before

520
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,559
2016 is that the emotion that always won

521
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:05,679
in the philippines

522
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,360
was happy or inspired anger was second

523
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,640
and it didn't shift until 2016. so

524
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:16,000
i think the first is truly to go to the

525
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
core of the problem which is that social

526
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,520
media platforms

527
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,480
take lies and facts and they treat it

528
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,200
all

529
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:26,080
the same right they treat it like data

530
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,919
and they don't differentiate

531
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:29,840
journalists differentiate we take out

532
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,520
the lies and that's

533
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,679
human moderation which is far more

534
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,640
expensive

535
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,520
than having an algorithm that has the

536
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,880
coder's bias

537
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,000
built in to actually do it automatically

538
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,919
right and i i also laugh when they say

539
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:45,679
but how do you do it at scale

540
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,600
uh shouldn't it be the question be the

541
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,880
other way around

542
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,559
why are you doing it at scale if you

543
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,240
don't know how to do it

544
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,799
right and and why is it the user's

545
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,600
responsibility to protect ourselves

546
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,600
i sound like i'm so anti-facebook or

547
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,960
anti-social media i'm not

548
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:06,159
i know it's powers i drank the kool-aid

549
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
right we helped spread twitter facebook

550
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:10,240
we

551
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,960
helped bring users on board because

552
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,320
precisely

553
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,720
up from 2012 which is when we began

554
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,960
until 2016

555
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,159
2015 it was an enabling tool

556
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,360
and then they got too greedy and then

557
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,679
they

558
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
realized that they could make a lot of

559
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,919
money but the cost

560
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:33,520
is to humanity right so this is

561
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,440
i think this is leadership this requires

562
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,840
leadership on both on the social media

563
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,640
platforms and

564
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,200
american social media companies and

565
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
governments

566
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,559
and and i and i'm going to pull this out

567
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:47,360
broader with coronavirus

568
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,480
i think this is ushering in an age

569
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:53,120
where communities of action you know

570
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,240
rappler's

571
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,640
uh elevator pitch in 2012 is that we

572
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,880
build communities of action the food we

573
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,039
feed our communities is journalism

574
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,080
well look i just saw the latest oxfam

575
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:04,799
report

576
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:08,159
where they pointed out that

577
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:11,120
power and money companies and

578
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,039
governments those who have power

579
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,440
and money have largely failed their

580
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,480
citizens

581
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,880
and the effort to provide a social

582
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,880
safety net has actually come

583
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,559
from the citizens themselves here in the

584
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,640
philippines it's the it's the community

585
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,440
pantry

586
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,720
when we just see you know our government

587
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,600
focused on either consolidation of power

588
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,000
or

589
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
our upcoming elections uh and

590
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,120
not enough on a social safety net it it

591
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:39,520
gave

592
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,080
the first two laws that it passed for

593
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,360
the coronavirus

594
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,240
so it gave a safety net to the large

595
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,360
corporations

596
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,159
so i think this is the time for citizens

597
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:50,720
for

598
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,679
those of us who are in democracies that

599
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,880
are faltering

600
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,400
to come together now how are we going to

601
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,280
do that this is why social media

602
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:02,880
is so important as i castigate them

603
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,600
i also am their biggest fan but please

604
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,520
moderate your greed guys

605
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,720
otherwise you're gonna wreck our world

606
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,039
well yes absolutely but you know again

607
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:15,120
um what complicates this further

608
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,960
at least in india is that my

609
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,200
disinformation is spreading

610
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,559
not just on open platforms like facebook

611
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,039
um but increasingly so in fact much more

612
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,640
so on whatsapp

613
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,799
and you know when we had lynchings a

614
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:30,159
couple of years ago

615
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,600
exactly yeah i mean

616
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,120
that was that was the story out of india

617
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:38,719
that made global deadlines and that

618
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,559
yeah uh i mean oh you're frozen i'm

619
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,360
gonna answer

620
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,440
that uh so

621
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,600
i think if you look at facebook's

622
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,559
reactions

623
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,440
post cambridge analytica right what

624
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,240
we've seen

625
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,240
is right after the cambridge analytica

626
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,360
scandal

627
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,159
uh facebook said we're gonna change our

628
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:01,039
algorithms

629
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,760
and we're going to emphasize family and

630
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:04,720
friends

631
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:07,200
and at that point news organizations

632
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,400
around the world

633
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,640
saw a decline in traffic from facebook

634
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,240
of anywhere from

635
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:15,280
40 to 60

636
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,480
and and then you know there was some

637
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,120
slight

638
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,360
shifting once facebook realized this

639
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,559
right but

640
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,039
the the reality is that when you focus

641
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:27,600
on family and friends

642
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,400
you also focus on disinformation because

643
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,000
it's the news organizations that

644
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
actually give you the facts

645
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:37,360
and when you when you down when you

646
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,320
when you push the dial down then the

647
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,039
facts

648
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,919
become harder to get to right and we do

649
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:44,240
know

650
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:46,480
facebook has the capability to turn the

651
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,520
dial up on

652
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,400
quality news on the facts they did it in

653
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,960
the u.s

654
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,279
elections they just choose not to do it

655
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,480
because

656
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,400
it makes less money at least that's my

657
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,440
thing i think the other part is

658
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,039
there's a lot of initiatives where

659
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,840
hundreds of millions of dollars are

660
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,080
spent

661
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,440
a panel the facebook oversight where

662
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,320
it spent two years and a lot of money to

663
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,120
bring in

664
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,840
really smart people but in the end all

665
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,679
of these are red herrings

666
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,320
because we already know the answer based

667
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,760
on the data

668
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,799
and all of it seems to be tactics to

669
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,279
just

670
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,559
delay to give you just enough so that

671
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
you are distracted from the fundamental

672
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:30,480
problem

673
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,159
of how you are being manipulated and i

674
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
think the hardest part here is that it's

675
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:39,279
insidious manipulation right if

676
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:41,039
you haven't seen the social dilemma

677
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,520
that's one way of looking at it that

678
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,400
every post you have is pulled together

679
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,240
by machine learning and a model

680
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
of you has created a model that knows

681
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,640
you better than you know yourself and

682
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,520
then ai

683
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
artificial intelligence comes in and

684
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,880
takes all of our models

685
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,360
and serves your most vulnerable point to

686
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:00,480
a message

687
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,000
to a company that's the new advertising

688
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,480
or to a government the new propaganda

689
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,640
and regardless of what you do

690
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
right whether you click or don't click

691
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:11,840
that

692
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,440
ad or that message it becomes part

693
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,960
of what cnn from mit calls the hype

694
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,960
machine um so

695
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,720
now the question is with that oh there

696
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,039
you are they're back i'm so happy i was

697
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:27,360
like

698
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,960
vamping for you i just

699
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:33,279
thank you thank you for uh for picking

700
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,720
up the thread even as

701
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,799
as you know i think my wi-fi is acting

702
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,080
up

703
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,080
well uh you know uh maria i was trying

704
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,480
to sort of uh get your thoughts on

705
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,559
on you know this this new challenge that

706
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:45,840
we face now

707
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,400
where we're talking about algorithms and

708
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,200
open platforms

709
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,039
we're also now dealing with a lot of

710
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:52,880
disinformation spreading on messaging

711
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:53,679
services

712
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,080
like like whatsapp in india whatsapp

713
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,000
introduced features to

714
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,960
reduce the virality of messages uh after

715
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:02,559
the lynchings took place but

716
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,880
to ask for any more regulation of the

717
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,080
service

718
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,919
seems to run the real risk of opening it

719
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:09,600
up to government surveillance in fact

720
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,640
that's actually

721
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,200
what whatsapp has sued the government

722
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,640
over where the government's basically

723
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:15,840
asking them to

724
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,559
break end-to-end encrypt encryption to

725
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,080
reveal the identity of the first

726
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:22,240
originator of messages

727
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,799
which kind of just makes me wonder that

728
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:26,799
is it that we now have a much bigger

729
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:28,400
problem on our hands where

730
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,480
technology has left the genie out of the

731
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,679
bottle but

732
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,440
technology alone can't put it back in

733
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,360
you're absolutely correct of course

734
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,440
you're absolutely correct and i'm really

735
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,679
glad that facebook took the position it

736
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:42,400
did and

737
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,880
you have to continue doing that story to

738
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,400
make sure they continue

739
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,720
taking the position that they did right

740
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,000
um

741
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,120
look this tech has

742
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,559
made billionaires out of people

743
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:59,760
right i mean out of out of tech

744
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,400
people but the reality also is that

745
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:02,960
there is

746
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,760
a lot of it that have been legislated

747
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,400
again so

748
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
let me take it out of the information

749
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
ecosystem and talk about genetic

750
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:10,720
research

751
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,679
right technology has actually allowed

752
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:14,880
geneticists to be

753
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
able to to look at our dna

754
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,679
and almost construct a human being in

755
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:24,000
end real we can actually change the

756
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
color of your eyes or

757
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,919
you can actually do this by design

758
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,440
design human beings

759
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,559
but is any

760
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,279
even geneticist is any human being

761
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:35,760
really

762
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,880
ready and able to play god

763
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,600
right and i think this is where in in

764
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,360
the western countries

765
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,559
crispr technology has put western

766
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,240
nations have put guidelines

767
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,679
in place around manipulating genetics

768
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:54,000
and that's important because they see

769
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,200
the potential

770
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
i think that same thing was very delayed

771
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,600
when it came to into the information

772
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,799
ecosystem and

773
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,200
and you know why should it have why

774
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,480
should it have been delayed

775
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,080
i think you and i became journalists

776
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,080
because we knew information

777
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,200
is power and this information now

778
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,399
has warped the world worked

779
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:18,520
because now ally replaces a fact

780
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,279
authoritarians are moving forward our

781
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,399
democracies

782
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,440
are dying and you know if the western

783
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,080
nations can't hold the line

784
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,159
what happens to our countries and who

785
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,240
takes responsibility for that so i

786
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,399
let me address the the what's up i was

787
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:35,520
actually there

788
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:38,880
there were so many meetings uh where

789
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,880
where this was discussed what do you do

790
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
and the very easy one is to just

791
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,159
limit the distribution but

792
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,840
it goes back to maybe throwing spaghetti

793
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,159
against the wall when it comes to

794
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:53,440
humanities

795
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,240
to shifting our behavior when it comes

796
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,679
to information

797
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,240
must be done within very specific

798
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,760
guidelines and this is where

799
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,440
i do look forward to i don't trust

800
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,120
facebook or or google or i mean google

801
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,399
has done a little bit better job but

802
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,000
depends on who you talk to right

803
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,200
youtube is right twitter

804
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:18,080
india knows this better but you know all

805
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,559
of this technology has got to have

806
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,159
regulations in place it's kind of like

807
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,039
pharmaceuticals

808
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,919
we put guard rails in place for this why

809
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:30,399
do tech companies get a free pass

810
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:32,720
we now see the impact of that and that

811
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,679
has to stop

812
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:36,640
so i look at the eu its democracy action

813
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,279
plan the two drafts of legislation and

814
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,919
you and i should keep putting inputs

815
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:43,360
into that so at least

816
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,360
the global south gets a voice at the

817
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,799
table the uk

818
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,440
has its online arms bill and then the us

819
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,080
has

820
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,399
is still playing with section 230 so

821
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:54,080
they're a little left behind but

822
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,799
i look at what the states are doing the

823
00:29:56,799 --> 00:29:58,559
attorney generals of the states are

824
00:29:58,559 --> 00:29:59,120
actually

825
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:02,000
filing the cases right if we don't fix

826
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,440
this now

827
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:06,000
the emergent behavior and this is the

828
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:06,480
thing

829
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
emergent behavior in india has led to

830
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,240
these mobs

831
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,039
emergent behavior in myanmar has led to

832
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,559
genocide

833
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,360
emergent behavior in the philippines has

834
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,159
led to

835
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,960
okay i'm gonna watch what i say here now

836
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:21,440
um

837
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:24,559
i guess i'm just saying that we are

838
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,640
creating

839
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,159
humanity's character you know we

840
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,600
are it is actively shifting

841
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,240
like the devil and angel are individual

842
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:36,960
battles for

843
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,679
integrity when you can make more money

844
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,760
because you tell a lie that spreads

845
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:43,600
faster and further

846
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,399
we see people a lot more people doing it

847
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:47,120
so these

848
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,159
incentives have got to stop and you know

849
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:51,679
i'm looking forward to twitter for

850
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,200
example they're trying

851
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,399
uh a paid a subscription model

852
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,519
because if that works then we have the

853
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:01,360
power of social media

854
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,960
without us without our data

855
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,320
without being insidiously manipulated

856
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,720
by it

857
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,120
absolutely i mean the platforms have to

858
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:16,000
take

859
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:18,880
far more sustainable corrective actions

860
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,240
and yes i mean it is

861
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,799
it is a complicated world and it is as

862
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,320
much now a political problem as a

863
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,000
technological problem but the two

864
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,039
are intertwined yeah and

865
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,120
their values have to be clear right i'm

866
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,039
sure you're gonna agree with me

867
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:35,840
uh so i'm putting words in your mouth

868
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,320
but

869
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:38,640
if their values aren't clear they're not

870
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,000
gonna be able to stand up to a

871
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,799
government

872
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,799
in this particular instance they stood

873
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,480
up to a government right so they

874
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,919
kind of have to put their money where

875
00:31:45,919 --> 00:31:47,600
their mouth is and they

876
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,840
should really stop the spend on

877
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,640
palliative

878
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,480
measures and get to the core of the

879
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,240
problem and

880
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,320
you know i have there's real reason i

881
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:58,960
say that

882
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,760
and i ask for solutions quickly because

883
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,200
if this isn't in place

884
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:06,000
this year when we walk into elections

885
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,760
next year we will not have

886
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:09,840
integrity of elections number one and

887
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,919
number two

888
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:14,640
i could go to jail i have real skin in

889
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,880
the game

890
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:20,080
absolutely i mean this this

891
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:23,279
has real life implications for millions

892
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:23,919
of people

893
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:28,000
and directly for us as journalists

894
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
fact as i was watching the film i was

895
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,000
struck by how far

896
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,320
you were through all of that and you

897
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,799
remain so calm you're right here with us

898
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:39,440
you're you know it's it's just really

899
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,279
inspiring to watch that

900
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,000
but you know it also made me wonder that

901
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:44,399
these

902
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,960
attacks on journalists one thing that

903
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,240
it's doing is it's making

904
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,120
us the story and personally i found it a

905
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,039
bit unsettling last year when my name

906
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,480
trended on twitter because there was a

907
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,399
police case against me for reporting

908
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:57,679
that i did from the prime minister's

909
00:32:57,679 --> 00:32:58,720
constituency

910
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:01,120
and i know there's a positive side to it

911
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,399
because there are

912
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,480
many many journalists who are facing far

913
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,039
worse without any public attention

914
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,240
on their cases and yet i do wonder what

915
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,279
the spotlight

916
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:14,720
on journalists is doing to trust in news

917
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,240
uh we don't see ourselves as the

918
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,399
opposition but we are being put in that

919
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:18,880
box

920
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,200
we are being valorized on one side and

921
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,880
being called enemies of the people on

922
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,360
another as someone who's faced this to

923
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,679
an intensity of a hundred thousand

924
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,120
what are your thoughts on this what do

925
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,519
you think is happening

926
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,679
i'm gonna take it apart into two strands

927
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,559
the first is

928
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,480
trust in news that you brought up and

929
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,080
then the second is the impact on

930
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:39,279
journalism right

931
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:41,440
so trust in news it's it's not just

932
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:42,640
trust in news it's

933
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:46,159
trust right so if lies spread

934
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:49,519
faster then you have a situation where

935
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,640
we have no facts because not only

936
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,279
do the algorithms spread the lies anger

937
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:56,000
and hate

938
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
faster which means disinformation

939
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
conspiracy theories

940
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,200
um you know thinking fast the the system

941
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:03,679
one

942
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:05,600
of our because that's how they keep us

943
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,799
on the platform

944
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,639
so not only does that happen but if you

945
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:11,040
don't have facts you can't have truth

946
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:14,079
without truth you can't have trust it

947
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:14,879
isn't just

948
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,359
in a way news organizations we're kind

949
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,440
of naval gazing because

950
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,760
we think it's the destruction of trust

951
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,960
in us it isn't just

952
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,839
us it's the destruction of trust in

953
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:26,800
everything

954
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,679
right so i i kind of joke when i put two

955
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,679
movies together to describe the world

956
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,719
today i

957
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,760
i think now we are living in the matrix

958
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,040
right and we each are performing our own

959
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,079
little

960
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:43,359
3 billion plus truman shows and the

961
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,040
question as i i have is

962
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:48,239
who is watching who is listening

963
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,960
listening which is critical to a working

964
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,960
democracy right what do we do with

965
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:55,040
information in the public sphere

966
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,320
uh you have to listen to that and then

967
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,200
safely debate it to change each other's

968
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,119
minds to find the best

969
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,359
path forward that's what that's the

970
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,680
implicit assumption of a democracy

971
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,160
uh so it isn't just trusted news i would

972
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,280
say right

973
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,280
i think social media has destroyed trust

974
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,320
and everything and

975
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,800
it does spread what it's seated with

976
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,640
right so again i go back to

977
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,760
online violence does not stay online

978
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:24,160
and social media spreads this stuff i

979
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,880
think the second thing of journalism

980
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,040
the destruction of journalism as we knew

981
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,960
it began a long time ago

982
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,920
and you know if you look at even things

983
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:35,920
if you remember in

984
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:39,040
my gosh was it 2018 when when we

985
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,760
discovered that facebook had given us

986
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,640
all the wrong

987
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:46,000
data about video and how far it spread

988
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,560
right to the tune of like their numbers

989
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,440
for video

990
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,320
were 90 inflated right

991
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,560
when they sorry say again

992
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,720
i said that that led so many news rooms

993
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,040
to pivot to video

994
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,599
exactly right that's and that's the

995
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,200
point and so what happened the

996
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,839
incentives for distribution led to bad

997
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,839
journalism that's one and

998
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:16,400
news organizations that maintained the

999
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,599
standards and ethics

1000
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,320
then looked at this number that was 90

1001
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,280
inflated

1002
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,240
and fired editorial people and hired

1003
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,000
video people and only to find

1004
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,320
out a few years later that oh that

1005
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,440
wasn't the truth so

1006
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,520
that we don't even know what the truth

1007
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,760
is this is part of the reason i call for

1008
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,760
greater transparency

1009
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,599
from the social media platforms right

1010
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:39,359
and instead what they've done is

1011
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:42,079
over the years including the most recent

1012
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:43,680
announcement of facebook

1013
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:46,720
they've narrowed down the data that

1014
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,200
is available for researchers to hold

1015
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,560
them in check

1016
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,720
that is disturbing right so look

1017
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:56,800
the mission of journalism has never been

1018
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,920
as important

1019
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,359
but our business model is dead and

1020
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,000
you know in many ways i think rappler is

1021
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,480
lucky

1022
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:06,880
because when we came under attack before

1023
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,160
coronavirus

1024
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,800
uh we our advertisers were the first

1025
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,359
people

1026
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,079
to be scared you know in 2018 when the

1027
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:14,880
government tried

1028
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,079
you saw that in there when the

1029
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,000
government tried to shut us down

1030
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,040
uh i by april 2018

1031
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,720
so we're fighting all this in court but

1032
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,880
by april so a few months four months

1033
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,839
after we dropped

1034
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:28,960
49 of our advertising revenue and it

1035
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,400
forced us to pivot

1036
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,119
and create a new product based on what

1037
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:33,599
we do

1038
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:35,440
as investigative journalists right how

1039
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,079
do we find disinformation networks

1040
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,079
and then create a product that would

1041
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,359
allow us

1042
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,560
to you to do give that to a company

1043
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,280
and that's i think that's the new world

1044
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
we have to create this new world

1045
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,960
but how do we do it how do we do it with

1046
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,720
the standards and ethics

1047
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,520
the mission of journalism intact the

1048
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,480
incentives are

1049
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:01,760
very low who wants to stand up to a

1050
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:03,440
duterte right if

1051
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:05,760
i mean i joke part of it is because i

1052
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,720
came of age

1053
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,280
in journalism's golden age i'm a little

1054
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
older than you and i'm really glad

1055
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,320
you're doing what you're doing

1056
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:15,839
in india but we hold the line

1057
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:19,440
because we see the impact of what would

1058
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,000
happen

1059
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,960
if we stopped

1060
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:27,839
thank you maria that that was just most

1061
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:29,280
wonderful we can go on

1062
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,599
and on there's so much to talk about

1063
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:34,160
that's a really good note to end on

1064
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:37,280
thank you so much for for joining us and

1065
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,320
all the very best for 2022 i hope things

1066
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,880
are better this time

1067
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,200
fingers crossed and good luck to india

1068
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,320
as well

1069
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,839
good luck to your team i mean we're

1070
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,079
navigating a really difficult world

1071
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:53,920
to human rights defenders to journalists

1072
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,400
hold the line

1073
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:04,079
okay um

1074
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:06,720
maya there are some questions for you uh

1075
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,320
sorry i should have

1076
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,560
noticed those popping up on my screen um

1077
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:16,320
well plenty of questions let's take some

1078
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,520
um yeah well

1079
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,960
do you think the pandemic in the

1080
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,400
accompanying flood of health

1081
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,480
disinformation has prompted any positive

1082
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,040
changes

1083
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,880
in terms of governance accountability of

1084
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,800
tech companies

1085
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:30,800
absolutely it showed that they are

1086
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,079
gatekeepers

1087
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,560
right it showed that they could actually

1088
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:35,200
stop it

1089
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,760
it showed that you know it would require

1090
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,480
money

1091
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,599
as all news organizations take

1092
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,280
but that they can the same way that the

1093
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,440
u.s election showed

1094
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,079
that the tech platforms can do this they

1095
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:49,359
just choose not to

1096
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,240
there's no incentive to do that but this

1097
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:53,599
is a time when lies

1098
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:56,720
kill that's what kobe did but i would

1099
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:59,599
actually carry that over into the

1100
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:01,359
political sphere

1101
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:05,440
and our political lives and governance

1102
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:08,839
it may not seem like it but lies

1103
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,240
kill and whether that's covid or

1104
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,359
governance facebook youtube

1105
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,760
twitter should take the exact same

1106
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,800
measures

1107
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,839
to make sure that the facts win

1108
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,440
right right

1109
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:27,280
uh well there's another question maria

1110
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,880
it sort of circles around some

1111
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,079
some of the stuff we've been talking

1112
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:32,400
about which is it seems that now with

1113
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,560
the draconian new i.t rules in india

1114
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,319
big tech is being forced to do a

1115
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:38,240
delicate dance between protecting their

1116
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,400
users from their own government

1117
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:42,319
and continuing to operate in the country

1118
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,400
to chase huge growth

1119
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,160
uh what do you think is the end game and

1120
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:49,759
how do you see this dance play out

1121
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:52,720
i hope that the leadership of the

1122
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:55,119
platforms gain some balls

1123
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,480
i mean because they have the power

1124
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:02,079
right and again any large

1125
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:05,920
company has a responsibility to the

1126
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,240
public it serves

1127
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:10,480
i would put that above shareholders

1128
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,079
although the incentives

1129
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:15,119
aren't as clear-cut and so i hope that

1130
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,960
as it navigates india i mean there's

1131
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:18,240
there have been a lot of

1132
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,319
stories that have come out from india

1133
00:41:20,319 --> 00:41:22,079
about you know the

1134
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,839
the people the facebook head working

1135
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,079
with the bjp you know there's so many

1136
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:33,200
what you talked about in terms of the

1137
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:36,240
pakistan and india that riot the mob

1138
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,760
that formed that came after people

1139
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,160
here's it's a delicate balance and it

1140
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:43,520
will take leadership

1141
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,680
and i think that will determine the kind

1142
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,960
of company

1143
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,880
that facebook will become and like

1144
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,400
everything if they don't

1145
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,920
define the problem i'm going to use

1146
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:53,599
their own words against them if they

1147
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,200
don't define the problem

1148
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,680
they can't solve it and as long as we're

1149
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:58,400
looking at

1150
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,040
paleo solutions like the facebook

1151
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,160
oversight board

1152
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,160
um disclosure um i joined the real

1153
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,079
facebook oversight board with carol

1154
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,680
cadwallider who broke the cambridge

1155
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,720
analytica story

1156
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,800
and shashana zubov who wrote

1157
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,560
surveillance capitalism right

1158
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,280
a whole bunch of other folks who really

1159
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,119
it's time to say enough is enough

1160
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:20,960
you've made enough money please show

1161
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:22,560
real leadership because

1162
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,480
this they will determine the way our

1163
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,680
world works and

1164
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,040
i guess to look for what can happen

1165
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,400
right let's look at 19th century in the

1166
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,440
united states

1167
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:35,680
i it's kind of a similar time period if

1168
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,839
you think about the robber barons right

1169
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:39,760
the sweat shops

1170
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,000
because if they kept making a lot of

1171
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,319
money using sweatshops at the expense of

1172
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,319
their people

1173
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:48,079
then there's a price to pay as well what

1174
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,119
did fdr franklin delano roosevelt do

1175
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:52,880
right he came in with a whole bunch of

1176
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,720
other things after that but i guess

1177
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,119
i'm just saying those robber barons they

1178
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,440
gave a lot to charity to assuage their

1179
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,079
guilt

1180
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,480
of what they've done this is that time

1181
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:03,280
period

1182
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:05,760
and enlightened self-interest on their

1183
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,560
part

1184
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:09,599
real leadership that's what we need and

1185
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,440
i really look forward to it

1186
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,000
frenemies

1187
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:18,960
um one final question maria which is

1188
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,800
what would be the differentiating factor

1189
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,720
in a subscription model for twitter

1190
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,640
content surfacing algorithms are still

1191
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,119
in place would the spiciest most

1192
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:29,119
inflammatory content still rise to the

1193
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:30,800
top of the pile of what people see if

1194
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,079
they're paying a monthly fee

1195
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,720
not necessarily we have to see how how

1196
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:37,440
twitter

1197
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,240
rolls this out right uh because it's

1198
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:40,640
very

1199
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,839
easy it's relatively easy to change the

1200
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,200
algorithms

1201
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:48,319
uh you know for many many years

1202
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,440
facebook sorry twitter was chronological

1203
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,920
right but then it grew to a point where

1204
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,920
then it personalized it here's

1205
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:57,839
here's and that's the main problem right

1206
00:43:57,839 --> 00:43:59,520
think about what personalization

1207
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,760
actually meant i mean when when the tech

1208
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:03,760
guys were talking about it really really

1209
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,359
early on i was like thinking

1210
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:07,760
what do you mean like i can make up my

1211
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,119
own reality

1212
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:12,319
which is exactly what personalization

1213
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:14,800
kind of allows you to do right that's

1214
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,680
why we're in our own little truman shows

1215
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:21,040
when the business model is not dependent

1216
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,480
on advertising their incentive scheme

1217
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,280
completely

1218
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:28,400
changes uh twitter also has another

1219
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,000
initiative

1220
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,160
i think it's called blue sky where

1221
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,119
they're looking at

1222
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,319
technology solutions for these problems

1223
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:37,119
today right

1224
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,160
the algorithm changes if they're getting

1225
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:43,599
if more of us uh subscribe just like

1226
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,400
with zoom

1227
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:47,280
or with microsoft teams right you don't

1228
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,839
see those platforms manipulating us

1229
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:52,960
in fact they make it easy for us to do

1230
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,400
these types of events well once twitter

1231
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,400
shifts to a subscription model

1232
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,240
it must keep the subscription the

1233
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,839
subscriber happy

1234
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,280
and being happy means that i'm able to

1235
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:08,240
uh get the news well that's me most

1236
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,720
people are on twitter for the news right

1237
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:13,440
so i'm hoping i don't know this is a

1238
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,720
time when we should be throwing

1239
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:15,440
spaghetti

1240
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:18,640
against the wall and i guess one of the

1241
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:19,680
worst things that i

1242
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,400
keep seeing is that the social media

1243
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:23,599
platforms

1244
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:26,400
refuse to throw spaghetti against the

1245
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:27,359
wall that would

1246
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:30,720
actually help prevent the worst abuses

1247
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:31,280
so

1248
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:34,319
for example right like we'll say hey

1249
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:37,119
uh you you can take this down and then

1250
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:37,920
they'll say but

1251
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:41,119
how and then they'll dive into the a

1252
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:44,160
rabbit hole of exactly like what does a

1253
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:44,800
woman

1254
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:47,040
what does breast mean is it this that's

1255
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:48,560
like that's

1256
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,800
atomizing to meaninglessness it's the

1257
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,119
principle of it right go back

1258
00:45:53,119 --> 00:45:56,319
uh if you are and now i'll shut up on

1259
00:45:56,319 --> 00:45:57,200
this

1260
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:58,880
because i don't want iran because i

1261
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,480
really do think there are people there

1262
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,440
trying to

1263
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,440
find the answer but their level of

1264
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,520
denial and obfuscation

1265
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,760
this needs to stop so they can truly

1266
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:09,200
find a solution

1267
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,520
and i have great confidence that once

1268
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,599
they define the problem

1269
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:15,920
the same way everyone around the world

1270
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,800
seeing it

1271
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,079
they will find the solution

1272
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,160
maya just one final question what would

1273
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,240
you say to the rest of us who may care a

1274
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,520
little easier than you

1275
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,440
who also want to speak truth to power

1276
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,200
i think you're doing it right uh i'm

1277
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:37,040
going to quote this

1278
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,079
last op-ed of george schultz which he

1279
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:42,079
published in december of 2020 he had

1280
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:43,040
been a

1281
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,800
a diplomat for a hundred i mean he was

1282
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,200
100 years old and he died earlier this

1283
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:49,920
year

1284
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,400
and the reason why i focused on that is

1285
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,040
because

1286
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,359
the lesson of this hundred years on

1287
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:56,079
earth

1288
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,240
was very simple and i'll summarize it in

1289
00:46:58,240 --> 00:46:59,359
two statements

1290
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:03,440
he said what he found out in negotiating

1291
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:06,000
all these treaties was that when you

1292
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,560
have

1293
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,079
trust in the room everything is possible

1294
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,280
without trust nothing

1295
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,160
is possible you can take that all the

1296
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,160
way from nations

1297
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,520
to individual my best advice to some of

1298
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:24,480
our managers

1299
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,559
is has really been to be vulnerable

1300
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:32,000
because the only time when we can

1301
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,599
really listen is when we open ourselves

1302
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:36,640
up

1303
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:40,000
meaning you are vulnerable when you open

1304
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,760
yourself up that way

1305
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:45,119
you see new views you listen

1306
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,680
and you can find something that's why

1307
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,160
trust

1308
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,720
happens so what the social media

1309
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:52,079
platforms have done

1310
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:55,760
is to put us in our most defensive

1311
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,880
to turn us into attack dogs and destroy

1312
00:47:58,880 --> 00:47:59,680
trust

1313
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:02,800
and that is extremely worrying for me

1314
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,839
both at an individual level and at a

1315
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:09,040
nation-state level

1316
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:13,040
thank you maria we'll end on that note

1317
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:13,839
then

1318
00:48:13,839 --> 00:48:15,920
thank you so much for all that you do

1319
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,079
thank you for inspiring us

1320
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:35,839
same to you thank you for having me

1321
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,240
you
