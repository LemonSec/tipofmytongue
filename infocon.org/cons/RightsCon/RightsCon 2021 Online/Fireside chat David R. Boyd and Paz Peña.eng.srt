00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:24,880
hi everyone

3
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,039
thank you for joining us for an hour of

4
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,560
conversation about the role of

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,599
technologies

6
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,120
in the environment my name is pass pena

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,200
and i'm based here in santiago of chile

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,280
in latin america and i work as an

9
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:39,840
independent consultant but in recent

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,200
years

11
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,280
an important part of my work has been

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,239
you know focused

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,320
on investigating the relationship

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,600
between technologies

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,920
with the climate crisis and other

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,520
environmental impacts

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,800
i want to introduce you david r boyd

18
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
the un special reporter of human rights

19
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
and environment david is also an

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,399
associate professor

21
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,199
of law policy and sustainability at the

22
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,360
university of british columbia

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,840
hello david hello paz delighted to be

24
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,280
joining you from canada today

25
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,000
thank you davey david and before we

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,640
begin

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,720
i want to remind you that you can you

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
know ask your questions make your

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:21,040
comments

30
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,759
on the chat and we will try to address

31
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:24,240
them

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,840
at the end of this session so

33
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
uh wow david there is a wide range of

34
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,840
issues range of issues that we can talk

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,479
about

36
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,560
in this hour but i want to start with a

37
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,400
term that is very familiar

38
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,280
to the right scum community uh i mean

39
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:41,600
the

40
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,920
technological solutionism you know this

41
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,040
idea that for

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,399
every social problem uh there is a a

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
technological solution

44
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,960
and and it's not because you know people

45
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,000
is

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,040
lazy and doesn't uh address properly

47
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,759
uh complex social issues and i think

48
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:00,159
that

49
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:03,600
technological solutionism is some sort

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,640
of natural consequence of the neoliberal

51
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,919
ideology where we quit to politics

52
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,959
and only find uh in technocratic

53
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,400
approaches the answers you know so

54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,239
i want to recall for example margaret

55
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
thatcher who said that there's not such

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
a thing as a society

57
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,480
it's there's only individuals and

58
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,400
families so when you

59
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,640
when you don't believe in society you

60
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:30,640
just quit to politics and

61
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
um technology is a really

62
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,720
um an appealing approach to solve

63
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,680
problems

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,040
so having said that david um the paris

65
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,360
agreement explicitly referred

66
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,319
refers to innovation and the united

67
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,680
nations framework

68
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,879
convention on climate change the unfccc

69
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,640
states that it is crucial to innovate

70
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,840
and to innovate and use

71
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
what they call revolutionary

72
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,519
technologies now to improve

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,480
our lives such as nanotechnology

74
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,879
blockchains the internet of things

75
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,640
and other information and communications

76
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,920
technologies so i want to ask you first

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
uh what do you think is you know as a

78
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,239
general approach

79
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,159
the role of technologies regarding

80
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:21,280
climate change

81
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,080
and how does technological solutionism

82
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,440
is also present

83
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,560
on the environmental agenda yeah this is

84
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,040
such a fascinating topic paz and so

85
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,000
thank you for asking this

86
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
question to get us started you know i

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,599
see technology really as

88
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,400
a double-edged sword technology does

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:38,959
offer

90
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,519
tremendous potential solutions but we

91
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
have such a long track record

92
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,799
of technology also creating new problems

93
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,799
and so i think that we have to be very

94
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,280
deliberative in our use of technology

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,360
we have to be very careful about the

96
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
types of technology that we're using and

97
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:56,720
creating

98
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,799
to take the example from the context of

99
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,879
climate change as you're mentioning

100
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,959
solar panels are a type of technology

101
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,560
and solar panels have become

102
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,720
much cheaper and much more efficient

103
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,040
over the past 30 or 40 years

104
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,480
through scientific research and

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
innovation and that's really important

106
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:12,879
so

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,599
solar panels are part of the solution to

108
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,798
climate change

109
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,120
but other people make the argument that

110
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,320
nuclear energy

111
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,839
is part of the solution to climate

112
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,600
change and we know that

113
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,479
nuclear energy is a very dangerous

114
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,320
technology it can

115
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
have impacts all along the chain from

116
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,400
the mining of uranium to the uh

117
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,199
construction

118
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,440
and operation of nuclear reactors to

119
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,120
dealing with nuclear waste

120
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,160
and so despite the the amazing science

121
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,440
that goes into the design of a

122
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,080
nuclear reactor i don't think that's a

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,120
technology that's

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,759
fit for purpose in the 21st century in

125
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,560
light of the

126
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,600
catastrophes we've seen at chernobyl at

127
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,479
fukushima

128
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,120
at three mile island especially when we

129
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,919
have this

130
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,960
perfectly safe technology in solar

131
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:05,199
in wind turbines and other renewable

132
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,120
energies that don't come with those

133
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,160
dangers

134
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
and you know so that's one example of

135
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,479
technological solutionism where

136
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,479
where there's both a a good side and a

137
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,639
bad side another is something

138
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,360
called uh direct air capture which is

139
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,840
this really exciting new technology that

140
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,199
you know brilliant scientists have

141
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,000
created basically a machine

142
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,199
that can suck carbon dioxide out of the

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,160
atmosphere

144
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,280
and produce synthetic hydrocarbons

145
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,280
fuels that are basically net zero carbon

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,080
that's a great technology right now it's

147
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,919
too expensive but i expect the costs

148
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:42,800
will come down

149
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
but we can't let that potential future

150
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:46,320
technology

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,400
stop us from taking the actions that are

152
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,400
so urgently needed today

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,840
to address the climate crisis

154
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,400
so uh uh i'm i'm recalling now the

155
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,600
the the that the u.s climate envoy uh

156
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,360
john kerry said like one month ago

157
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,680
he said that 50 of the carbon reductions

158
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,800
needed to get to net zero will come from

159
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
technologies that have not yet

160
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,240
been invented does that mean we have to

161
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,280
keep waiting for political action can we

162
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,319
consider

163
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:24,639
uh technological solutionism a form of

164
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:25,840
climate change

165
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,039
danielism yeah i'm not sure that it's

166
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,759
denialism but it's very troubling for us

167
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,280
to hear that kind of comment from

168
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,080
someone

169
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,960
of such stature as john kerry because i

170
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,560
believe that we actually have

171
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,199
all of the solutions that we need to

172
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:41,600
take

173
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,600
action right now to address the climate

174
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,199
emergency we should be

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,759
building renewable energy installations

176
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,880
you know

177
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,319
as fast as humanly possible so whether

178
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,759
that's wind or solar

179
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,400
or geothermal or small-scale

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,080
run-of-the-river hydroelectric type

181
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,120
projects

182
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
so we also face this conundrum when we

183
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,080
talk about climate change and energy

184
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,319
you know paz you live in chile i live in

185
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,520
canada we're very

186
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,039
we're very fortunate we're among the

187
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,039
privileged wealthy nations of the world

188
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:13,599
where the majority of people have access

189
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:14,160
to

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,599
adequate energy services but there are

191
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,440
still a billion people in the world

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,160
who don't have any access to electricity

193
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,479
so

194
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,880
clearly there is a large amount of work

195
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,599
to be done

196
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,639
to deliver elect energy services to

197
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:31,120
people living in poverty at the same

198
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,680
time

199
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,440
those of us living in wealthy western

200
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,360
nations are consuming

201
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,639
such a vast volume of energy in our

202
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,000
daily lives

203
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,160
that it's really not sustainable we

204
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,599
couldn't live in a planet with

205
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,280
today's population of almost eight

206
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,599
billion people if everyone lived like

207
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,479
us paz we would obliterate the planet

208
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:50,960
earth

209
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,280
and so part of the solution has to be

210
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,800
not only technology

211
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,199
but behavior and values and i think

212
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,319
that's a really

213
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,319
important part of the solution that

214
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,400
often gets overlooked if we focus too

215
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:02,960
much

216
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,879
on technology yes and actually

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,919
uh related to that idea you know to

218
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,960
think about the

219
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,360
our models of development you know in

220
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,160
terms of

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,360
what is what those models are uh

222
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,160
causing to the cloud to to the climate i

223
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,639
i

224
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,680
i want to um to recall the

225
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,560
global e-sustainability initiative which

226
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,120
is

227
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,599
which is a report prepared by the

228
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,520
private company accenture

229
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,519
and they say that icts can enable a 20

230
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,559
reduction of global co2 emissions by

231
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,839
2030 holding emissions at 2015

232
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,160
levels and i'm quoting this means

233
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,120
we can potentially avoid the trade-off

234
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,760
between

235
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,839
economic prosperity and environmental

236
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:54,640
protection the trade-off

237
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,760
again of economic prosperity and

238
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,600
environmental protections

239
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,480
so first i want to ask you if you think

240
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,760
there is a trade-off

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,080
or is just a false dilemma choosing

242
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,080
between economic prosperity

243
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,360
or environmental protection i think we

244
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,360
can actually balance the two but

245
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440
i think in a lot of cases we are going

246
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,040
to have to stop doing some of the things

247
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,160
that we're doing today

248
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,760
so i think that you know the whole

249
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,160
notion of sustainable development

250
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,720
is development that meets the needs of

251
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,800
today's generation today's people

252
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,959
without compromising the ability of

253
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,720
future generations to fulfill their

254
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,440
needs

255
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,480
and what we are doing today in

256
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,800
our product our systems of production

257
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,760
and consumption

258
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,720
we are currently compromising the needs

259
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,080
of future generations

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,240
so just a few weeks ago the german

261
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,839
constitutional court in quite a

262
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:47,600
revolutionary decision

263
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,360
in a lawsuit that was brought by young

264
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,240
people from germany and around the world

265
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,440
said that the government of germany was

266
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,560
inflicting radical deprivation on young

267
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,680
people in the future

268
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,399
by failing to take adequate climate

269
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,440
action today

270
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,200
that's really what we're talking about

271
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,560
our lifestyles today

272
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,440
inflicting radical deprivation on people

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
who are going to be living

274
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,279
just a few decades from now unless we

275
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,720
change those systems of

276
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,680
production and consumption and so yes we

277
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,519
can have economic prosperity

278
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,279
yes we can have ecological

279
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:23,600
sustainability but we can't

280
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,680
we can't have everything we can't have

281
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,079
uh excessive degrees of consumption

282
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,200
and uh the the production you know

283
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,079
there are laws of nature laws of physics

284
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:34,480
that

285
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:37,519
despite our technological ingenuity we

286
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:41,200
are still bound by and we cannot escape

287
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,440
do you think that uh there's different

288
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,279
responsibility around this

289
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:48,959
with you know developed world and the

290
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,440
uh you know uh the global south i'm

291
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,320
thinking that

292
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,959
uh there's that there is this uh

293
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
fascinating agenda of the growth

294
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,519
you know where basically people are

295
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,600
saying you know we cannot

296
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,760
uh um you know

297
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,160
still working with this development

298
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,040
development

299
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:11,839
development model where we grow and grow

300
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,279
and grow the economic

301
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,760
our economies need to grow to have uh

302
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,399
this kind

303
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:19,920
of um you know development

304
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,880
and and i'm asking you it's it is a

305
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,440
different

306
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,760
responsibility from the global north to

307
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,120
the global south because

308
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
it sounds like unjust to to

309
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,360
to to have this um this idea of the

310
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,079
growth

311
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,839
for everyone you know oh yeah i mean

312
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,040
absolutely pass i mean in in my work as

313
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,880
the un special rapporteur i've traveled

314
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,680
to countries like fiji and kenya and if

315
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,399
if if someone was to go to kenya and say

316
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,200
you need to

317
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
you need to have a policy of degrowth of

318
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,800
shrinking your economy

319
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,000
when the majority of people in kenya are

320
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,639
living in poverty i mean that's just a

321
00:11:58,639 --> 00:11:59,839
crazy idea that's

322
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,560
just totally irresponsible immoral

323
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,760
unconscionable

324
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,000
but if you look at it from the global

325
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,120
perspective

326
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,920
you know we know that the the wealthiest

327
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,279
10 or 20 percent

328
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,160
of the population are causing at least

329
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,200
80 percent

330
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,639
of the environmental damage whether

331
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
that's climate change or the loss of

332
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,440
biodiversity or

333
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,320
air water and soil pollution and so it

334
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,120
really is

335
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,600
incumbent upon that 10 to 20 percent

336
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,160
which

337
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
is people like me in canada people like

338
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,000
you in chile people in the

339
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,320
in the global north but wealthy

340
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,040
countries

341
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
have an immoral and ethical

342
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,200
and increasingly i would say a legal

343
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,120
obligation because of international

344
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,480
human rights law

345
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,279
to take action to address these

346
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,120
environmental challenges which in many

347
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,959
cases will require us

348
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:52,160
to shrink the material or

349
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,240
ecological footprint of our societies

350
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,000
david i want to talk a little bit more

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
about green technologies now

352
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,639
so an important part of the hope with

353
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,920
digital technologies

354
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
is that they can play a very important

355
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,279
role

356
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
in the use of green energy you know the

357
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,120
classic example

358
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
electric cars for example no but in

359
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,440
order to use green energy

360
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,800
we must continue to exploit nature

361
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,320
you know for example we can look at the

362
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,560
case of lithium-ion battery production

363
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
here in chile

364
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,000
these batteries are the only way to

365
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,839
store green energies no

366
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:31,600
and to produce batteries we need lithium

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,160
and to extract lithium we need intensive

368
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,160
exploitation of fresh water

369
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,880
and salt flakes in the andean region

370
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,839
actually there's

371
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
ah there's a triangle between chile

372
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,880
argentina and bolivia call it the

373
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,240
lithium triangle where

374
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
it's the most important reservoir of

375
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,600
lithium in the world

376
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,880
so again this uh

377
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,199
intensive exploitation of fresh water in

378
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:57,920
salt floods

379
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,279
produced a scarcity of fresh water

380
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,519
then the displacement of indigenous

381
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,720
populations and

382
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,760
native species and other you know social

383
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,199
economic and cultural

384
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,160
effects so again you know another

385
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,360
community and

386
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,639
another species pay the price of green

387
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
development so how can we learn

388
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,519
from the mistakes of fossil fuel-based

389
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,199
extractivist capitalism and achieve an

390
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,240
energy matrix that is um

391
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,040
sustainable in the pro sense of the word

392
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,680
no or

393
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,720
in the deep sense of the world

394
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,360
right so i think that you know you're

395
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,040
these are these are big questions

396
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,519
past and i think i know what we really

397
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,519
are talking about

398
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,199
yeah and so you know what the world's

399
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,959
leading scientists are saying

400
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,720
you know the intergovernmental panel on

401
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,160
climate change the intergovernmental

402
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,920
panel on biodiversity and ecosystem

403
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,560
services

404
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,560
what these world-leading scientists are

405
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,959
saying is that human society right now

406
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,160
is at a critical juncture and we need to

407
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,639
uh we need to make systemic and

408
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:06,399
transformative changes

409
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:08,720
to our economies and our societies in

410
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,079
order to address these global

411
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,440
environmental crises

412
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,079
and green technology is definitely part

413
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:15,120
of the answer

414
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,600
but we have to be really cautious about

415
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,120
green technologies for the reasons that

416
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,000
you're saying

417
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,720
i mean uh bitcoin is seen as one of

418
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,040
these

419
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,440
exciting digital technologies but

420
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:26,079
bitcoin

421
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,480
mining is extraordinarily energy

422
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,199
intensive

423
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:31,920
so bitcoin mining already uses more

424
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:32,560
entered

425
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,720
more more electricity than the entire

426
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,920
country of sweden

427
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
and we're just you know we're in the

428
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
early days of bitcoin really

429
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,360
um the supply chains that you talk about

430
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,959
for electric vehicles

431
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,399
uh lithium mining uh if we talk about

432
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:47,360
computers and

433
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
uh cell smartphones we're talking about

434
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:51,120
rare earth minerals that are

435
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
sourced from china uh african nations

436
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:58,399
and with real environmental issues and

437
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,120
human rights

438
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,360
issues involved in those production

439
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
systems and so

440
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
the answer if you will i mean the the

441
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,240
two big answers that i think

442
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,959
really have to be at the forefront are

443
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,839
as you mentioned

444
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
switching from fossil fuels which

445
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,199
in some ways were a great technology

446
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:16,720
when they were first introduced

447
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,440
and enabled part of humanity to become

448
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,519
incredibly wealthy and well-off

449
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,639
but now the externalities the downsides

450
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:25,600
of using

451
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,000
and burning fossil fuels are crystal

452
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,680
clear and we have to shift away from

453
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,240
them

454
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:33,519
to renewable energy as rapidly as we can

455
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,920
and then in the broader context of this

456
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,680
econ economic system that you are

457
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,040
describing where we

458
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,000
extract natural resources from nature we

459
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,360
manufacture

460
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,720
goods creating vast amounts of pollution

461
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:47,920
and contamination

462
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,519
we use these goods and then we just

463
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:52,079
dispose of them uh polluting back into

464
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:52,959
nature

465
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,240
that linear model has to be replaced

466
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:59,440
by a circular economic model where we

467
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,839
where we basically reuse

468
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:06,000
recycle compost everything that we make

469
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,280
and this is going to be

470
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,319
you know we were talking about

471
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,799
innovation earlier this is going to be a

472
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:11,199
real

473
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,160
test of human ingenuity and innovation

474
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:16,240
to take this linear economic model

475
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,439
that's been in place

476
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,000
since the industrial revolution and bend

477
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,359
it to fit an

478
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:24,000
equitable and sustainable future it's a

479
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
huge challenge but there are exciting

480
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,959
things being done

481
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,520
all over the world in in terms of trying

482
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:32,880
to make that transition pass

483
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,440
yeah absolutely a circular economy is

484
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,320
one of the most

485
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,400
uh exciting things now and we're going

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,520
to talk

487
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,840
later about that because actually

488
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,600
technology has a lot to say

489
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
on circular economy but before i wanted

490
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,919
to ask you that

491
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,799
you know many of the big tech companies

492
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:51,520
know

493
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:54,880
google amazon microsoft are committing

494
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,600
to becoming

495
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,840
carbon neutral and in fact google

496
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,480
announced

497
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,200
i think it was early this year that its

498
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,160
data centers

499
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,720
and offices will be carbon free energy

500
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
by 2030

501
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:12,160
but the type of energy matrix matrix

502
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,280
is not the only problem to be solved no

503
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,120
especially regarding data centers um

504
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,760
and in this regard i would like to focus

505
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
on the use of water

506
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,679
you know in data centers which in

507
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,679
general is a topic that is a little

508
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:28,799
noticed

509
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,559
data centers can consume immense amount

510
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:34,720
of water directly

511
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:37,760
for cooling systems and indirectly

512
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,440
through the water requirements of

513
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,480
non-renewable electricity generation

514
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,679
um some author authors actually say that

515
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:46,880
google for example

516
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
considers white water use in data

517
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,640
centers

518
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,840
to be a trade secret no there's

519
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,960
there is no transparency even for the

520
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,240
community who

521
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,880
are you know receiving this kind of mega

522
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,480
infrastructures in their

523
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:05,520
in their territories so what do you

524
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:05,840
think

525
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,520
should be the role of technology

526
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,080
companies with respect to water

527
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,960
uh the water use on the one of the most

528
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,039
important infrastructures today for the

529
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,000
modern world

530
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,440
data centers yeah well as as you know as

531
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,440
a as the un special rapporteur on human

532
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,039
rights in the environment i really am a

533
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:24,880
strong believer in transparency i

534
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,400
believe people have a right to

535
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,600
information and

536
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,080
so that that information on water use

537
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,919
should be publicly disclosed that's the

538
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:32,720
first point

539
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,880
the second point is that if water is

540
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,320
being used for cooling

541
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:38,880
then the technology already exists to to

542
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,640
make that a closed loop so that the same

543
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:41,679
water can be

544
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:44,720
recaptured and and used over and over

545
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,400
again so that it's not a constant

546
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,760
consumer of water

547
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
but rather using that water over and

548
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
over again for cooling purposes

549
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,240
so you know this is this is a good

550
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,080
example of where technology

551
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,480
can come to the rescue it's more

552
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,160
expensive and that's why it hasn't been

553
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:00,960
done yet

554
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,000
but it has been done in some some fossil

555
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,080
fossil fueled power plants and nuclear

556
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,840
power plants that also

557
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,880
depend on large volumes of water for

558
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,000
cooling purposes

559
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,080
have managed to close that loop which

560
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,679
dramatically reduces

561
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:19,120
their water consumption yeah and i think

562
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,600
this

563
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,080
discussion is super important especially

564
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,360
when we think that

565
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,840
uh water resources are in danger because

566
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,520
of climate change

567
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,720
yes exactly and water is a fundamental

568
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,840
human right and so

569
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,600
we need to make sure that in every

570
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:34,880
country in the world

571
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,919
there are laws in place that prioritize

572
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:40,799
access to water for human uses and for

573
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,840
growing food

574
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,039
ahead of industrial uses of water

575
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,280
that's a basic human rights issue and

576
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,280
there shouldn't be any question about

577
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,520
that

578
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,640
so i want to start

579
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
talking about circular economy but i

580
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,039
want to make a proxy question before

581
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,000
uh because many industries say that the

582
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,400
digital economy will help

583
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,120
the materialization of the economy

584
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,600
understood dematerialization as the

585
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,880
reduction of the use of resources

586
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
on the one hand for example the digital

587
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,960
economy converts

588
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,720
um products into services no

589
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:23,280
let's think think about the musical

590
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,679
industry or the movies industries where

591
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,400
you know the physical components are not

592
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:29,360
needed because

593
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,480
now everything is on stream uh

594
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,440
but the numbers are saying that this is

595
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,320
not enough

596
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,640
yet no uh it's a it's a little

597
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,679
proportion

598
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,200
uh of that uh you know it's that digital

599
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,600
economy can convert products into

600
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,919
services we need to do more on that

601
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:52,080
but also um the same innovation

602
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:54,640
has meant that we have to renew our

603
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,679
devices

604
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,720
every year you know um and

605
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,960
i'm not only thinking about our cell

606
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,039
phones or you know our computers but

607
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
also i'm thinking about you know this

608
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,159
um smart device

609
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,840
devices as your refrigerator

610
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,000
refrigerator

611
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,480
you know your tvs et cetera et cetera so

612
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,760
we have to renew

613
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,200
all that equipment every year to keep up

614
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:22,080
you know within innovation so this is

615
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,760
increasing what is called

616
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,120
the e-waste no right could you share

617
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,520
your concerns about e-waste and his

618
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:33,120
environmental impacts yeah absolutely i

619
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,159
mean e-waste

620
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,960
has huge environmental impacts and huge

621
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,039
human rights impacts and so

622
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:41,919
um you know the promise of digital

623
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,400
technologies in terms of dem

624
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,640
materialization

625
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:47,840
will not be reached until we have uh

626
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
done away with what i what i described

627
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,640
as designed obsolescence you know these

628
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,799
so many of these devices are

629
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:55,679
intentionally

630
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,679
manufactured in such a way that they

631
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,960
cannot be repaired

632
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,520
you cannot replace the battery they have

633
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,799
a a

634
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:05,600
a very short functional life and then

635
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:05,919
they

636
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,440
are either sent to landfill or they are

637
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,720
put into recycling chains that only

638
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,280
extract

639
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,600
a portion of the materials that were

640
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,280
used to manufacture them

641
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,000
in the first place and often that

642
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,440
recycling process

643
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,880
takes place in very uh

644
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,039
dangerous conditions that that are a

645
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,960
violation of workers rights a violation

646
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,919
of human rights

647
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:31,840
and so this actually connects back

648
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,360
everything seems to keep connecting back

649
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,440
to this idea of a circular economy

650
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,080
to to achieve a circular economy we need

651
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,280
product redesign

652
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:41,600
and as well as economic rod as redesign

653
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,600
so these products have to be redesigned

654
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,799
in such a way that

655
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,840
they are easily disassembled and

656
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,480
all of their parts can be reused or

657
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:51,600
recycled

658
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:53,360
and you know there's uh there's actually

659
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,760
a program in the united states called

660
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,919
cradle to cradle certification

661
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,960
which is a terrific private

662
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,919
certification process where products

663
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:04,480
that meet

664
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:07,039
certain criteria for recyclability

665
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,400
reusability

666
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,600
um and and the safety of of the

667
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,279
chemicals and components used within

668
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:13,600
them

669
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,440
can achieve this uh cradle to cradle

670
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,200
certification i actually

671
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,640
believe that cradle to cradle

672
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,880
certification needs to move

673
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:24,240
from being a niche uh a voluntary niche

674
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:24,720
type of

675
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,279
uh program to being embedded in laws

676
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,559
that require

677
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:30,960
uh complete recyclability of pro

678
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,000
products and and

679
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,480
the exciting and positive news is that

680
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,000
we're moving in this direction so for

681
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,880
example

682
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,840
in the uh european union in canada we

683
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,120
now have laws that

684
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,559
require uh a certain percentage uh it's

685
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,240
approximately 90 of all motor vehicles

686
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:51,120
to be capable of being completely uh

687
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,880
disassembled and recycled

688
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,120
so that's and there's similar laws in

689
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,440
place for consumer electronics as well

690
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:59,279
we need those laws to be stronger more

691
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:00,960
comprehensive to apply to

692
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,120
everything that we make and use we also

693
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
need to clean up the supply chain so

694
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,000
that there aren't these

695
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,559
really horrific conditions where

696
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,559
vulnerable populations people living in

697
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:11,520
poverty are

698
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,679
are exposing themselves to dangerous

699
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,200
chemicals as part of

700
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,679
the recycling process but we have the

701
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,000
capability to clean up that supply chain

702
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:20,799
we have the

703
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,679
technological ingenuity to make products

704
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,080
that

705
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,320
are uh cradle to cradle that are

706
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,679
circular in nature

707
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:30,080
but that's not going to happen without

708
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,520
laws that force

709
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,679
businesses to do that and so that's

710
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:34,559
really

711
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:38,399
where our efforts have to lie

712
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,960
i'm really excited excited about

713
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,000
circular economy

714
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,159
and and having you in this conversation

715
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:45,520
because i know you are an

716
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,840
expert on it and i really wanted to ask

717
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,200
you

718
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:52,799
if circular economy can work

719
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:55,200
at the scale that we need for the

720
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,960
environmental challenges

721
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:00,159
challenges that we face yeah absolutely

722
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:02,000
it can i mean and that's the that's the

723
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,520
beauty of the concept of a circular

724
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,799
economy is that

725
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,279
it's actually the only way that we are

726
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:08,720
going to be able to live

727
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,200
in a sustainable fashion with you know

728
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,200
by 2050 we're going to have 10 billion

729
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,080
people

730
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,240
more or less living on this planet the

731
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,600
only way they're going we're going to

732
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
live sustainability is

733
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,360
through a circular economy that reduces

734
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,400
the pressure

735
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,679
on ecosystems and nature and

736
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,279
you know the thing that people have to

737
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,720
think about in terms of the circular

738
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,600
economy

739
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,080
this is a multi-trillion dollar

740
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:32,960
opportunity

741
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:34,799
just like the shift from fossil fuels to

742
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:36,799
renewables is a multi-trillion dollar

743
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:37,600
opportunity

744
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,279
the shift from internal combustion

745
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,360
engine vehicles to electric vehicles is

746
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,279
a multi-trillion dollar opportunity

747
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,640
i mean the the economic opportunities of

748
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,559
these transitions towards sustainability

749
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:50,240
if we manage them carefully

750
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,240
are phenomenal they should really they

751
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
should really provide benefits to people

752
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,960
all over the world but you know in

753
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,640
canada and the european union we're

754
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,080
starting this journey towards the

755
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,200
circular economy

756
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,840
looking at plastics i know people are

757
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:04,799
understandably

758
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:06,400
really concerned about plastics because

759
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,320
we see these images of beaches

760
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,919
completely covered in plastic

761
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,919
we know that plastic is getting into the

762
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,760
to the fish in the oceans the food that

763
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,400
we eat

764
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,720
even the water that we drink has plastic

765
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,159
micro particles in it

766
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
so we really are under the gun to figure

767
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,080
out ways that we can

768
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,880
alter the plastics economy in a way that

769
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:25,679
prevents

770
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,200
plastic from getting into the

771
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
environment where ultimately

772
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,600
it comes back and gets into us and so

773
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,760
that's really one of the leading edges

774
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,080
of the push towards the circular economy

775
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,120
is how can we

776
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,440
redesign plastic products including

777
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,720
packaging

778
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,720
and systems to make sure that all of the

779
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,720
plastic which is a useful material i

780
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,039
mean

781
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,640
i hear some people saying we should get

782
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,080
rid of plastic i mean that's

783
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,640
just not realistic i'm afraid it has too

784
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,600
many uses

785
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,159
but what we can do is we can redesign

786
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,640
products and we can redesign systems

787
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,880
there's a system called extended

788
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,640
producer responsibility that i'm really

789
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,600
excited about

790
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,919
which is where governments pass laws

791
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,279
putting the burden

792
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,679
of recycling onto the industry

793
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:08,799
themselves

794
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:10,640
not only to pay for the recycling

795
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:12,159
systems but to actually

796
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,320
operate those systems and where i live

797
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,000
in british columbia here we have one

798
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
of the world leading systems where about

799
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,159
six years ago the government passed

800
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,120
a regulation saying that the industry

801
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,279
has to collect all of its

802
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,120
all of the glass all of the plastic all

803
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,720
of the metal all of the paper

804
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,799
so the industry themselves all of the

805
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:32,399
businesses in bc that are

806
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,960
responsible for importing and producing

807
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,159
those products

808
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:38,640
they have formed a consortium they have

809
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,399
built a system that

810
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,559
across the entire province collects all

811
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,600
of this material

812
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,159
and then recycles it and so that's the

813
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,919
way the system has to operate because

814
00:28:47,919 --> 00:28:49,840
you know in a wealthy place like canada

815
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,360
even we couldn't afford uh

816
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:55,840
effective municipal recycling programs

817
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:56,640
we have to put

818
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,720
the burden on industry industries

819
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
fantastic at getting their products to

820
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
the consumer

821
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,760
in the most efficient way possible and

822
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,440
what we're learning is that they're just

823
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
as effective in getting their products

824
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,279
back from consumers

825
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,760
and so that's a really exciting step

826
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:12,559
towards

827
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,080
circularity in the economy

828
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,080
david and what what do you think is the

829
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:20,799
position of

830
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,200
technological industry around circular

831
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:25,760
circular economy

832
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,840
well as i was saying every everything

833
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,960
needs to be circular

834
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,279
right past so um cell phones have to be

835
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:32,080
redesigned

836
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,080
uh smartphones have to be redesigned

837
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,200
computers have to

838
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,840
be redesigned all of the mainframe

839
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,520
computers have to be redesigned all of

840
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,360
these consumer electronics have to be

841
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:42,320
redesigned

842
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,720
and it has to be companies like apple

843
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,240
and samsung

844
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,960
and others that are responsible for

845
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,799
redesigning their products

846
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:53,279
making sure they're not using hazardous

847
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:54,880
materials in those products

848
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,520
making sure those products can be re

849
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,880
recycled

850
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,240
and can be reused and

851
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,159
then you know so that we so that we

852
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:05,919
actually have that circularity

853
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:09,039
in terms of those technological products

854
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,640
and then of course technology has much

855
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,080
to offer in terms of

856
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,320
how do we actually go about those

857
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,880
recycling

858
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,640
how do we build those recycling systems

859
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,960
i went to a i went to a new facility

860
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,640
that was built in vancouver

861
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,799
where they are doing some of the world's

862
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,799
leading plastics recycling

863
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,600
and it was incredible to see these

864
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
literally paths it looked like

865
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,799
mountains of garbage in this huge huge

866
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:36,559
open building they were being pushed

867
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:38,240
around by tractors and i just thought to

868
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
myself

869
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,679
my god how can this ever be turned into

870
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:43,360
something useful or valuable

871
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:45,440
it just looked like mountains of garbage

872
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:47,679
but they go through this

873
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,840
incredibly complicated system of

874
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:52,159
conveyor belts and computer sensors and

875
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:53,919
blowers and magnets

876
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:55,840
and you wouldn't believe at the end of

877
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,519
this process

878
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,880
you would get big bales of

879
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,039
white plastic of blue plastic number

880
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
seven so it's all

881
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,320
sorted and then those giant bales of

882
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:07,120
plastic

883
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,159
go to a second facility where the they

884
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:12,159
go through a giant washing machine

885
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,080
then they go through a shredder and then

886
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,519
they go through this other machine and

887
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,720
what comes out

888
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,279
are the day i was there was little white

889
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,080
pellets

890
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,960
of uh plastic that can be rematched

891
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,159
remanufactured

892
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,559
into plastic bottles for drinking water

893
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,279
so

894
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:29,679
uh and so they those pet and then the

895
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:32,240
that facility was right beside a rail

896
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,440
line and so they just

897
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:35,039
they literally go from this giant

898
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,960
machine through a tube

899
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,120
fill up rail cars they go back to the

900
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,640
plant where they're making the plastic

901
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,000
bottles and the plastic yogurt

902
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,960
containers

903
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,279
and you you can you can do that so

904
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,440
that's technology has enabled us

905
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,000
to create those kinds of recycling

906
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,480
systems

907
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:56,480
so the movement uh the right to repair

908
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:57,120
know

909
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:59,360
the right to repair your own devices

910
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,640
that's super big

911
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:04,240
in the us and in in europe um

912
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:07,039
so i've been uh researching on that and

913
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:07,279
i

914
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:10,320
i i was um you know

915
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:14,000
uh not surprised to see that apple for

916
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:17,039
example is known for its barriers the

917
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,799
customers tries to fix

918
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,880
their own devices including you know

919
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,880
like physical mechanisms such as

920
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:26,240
um proprietary screws and you know parts

921
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,159
that only

922
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,399
approved repair shops can access et

923
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:31,919
cetera et cetera so

924
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:35,120
microsoft also has arranged

925
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,760
an aggressive lobby against the idea in

926
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,880
the u.s

927
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:41,679
why do you think technological companies

928
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:42,080
uh

929
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:45,039
should overlook the circular economy and

930
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:45,360
and

931
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,000
and be you know big with the with the

932
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,799
idea of

933
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:52,399
the right of to repair their own devices

934
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,240
yeah so that's a really good question

935
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,519
and so you know

936
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:57,200
we have something called the united

937
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,120
nations guiding principles on business

938
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,799
and human rights and i think that

939
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,200
companies that are really uh trying to

940
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,519
comply with those guiding principles

941
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,159
will be open to having and making

942
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,200
products that

943
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,600
that do that are compatible with the

944
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,200
right to repair

945
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,360
and if companies aren't going to do that

946
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:16,640
voluntarily pass

947
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:18,399
then governments are going to step in

948
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:19,760
and make them do it and

949
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,200
and that's challenging because these

950
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,799
companies are big and powerful

951
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:24,880
but i think that's where we as you know

952
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,080
digital citizens

953
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,559
we can use the internet to come together

954
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:29,600
in huge numbers

955
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,519
and that's where we can we can use our

956
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,760
power as citizens to fight back and say

957
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,000
we demand that governments require

958
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,960
corporations

959
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,519
to make products that we can repair you

960
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:40,399
know you know like

961
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:43,519
there's no reason why if i've got an uh

962
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,399
for example an electric toothbrush why

963
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:46,720
can't

964
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,559
i change the battery and why do i have

965
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:50,080
to buy a new electric

966
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,679
toothbrush every time the battery runs

967
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,159
out that just doesn't make sense to me

968
00:33:54,159 --> 00:33:56,159
or a lot of people we should be able to

969
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,760
repair and replace those types of

970
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,559
products

971
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,240
another one that's really important in

972
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,960
terms of a huge issue in the

973
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,120
in the development of sustainable

974
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,480
transportation

975
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:09,839
is electric vehicles which have

976
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,839
different types of plugs

977
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,760
well so are we going to have to have a

978
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,760
whole system of charging stations for

979
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,560
teslas

980
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,320
a whole different system of charging

981
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,320
stations for uh for

982
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,639
toyotas no that doesn't make any sense

983
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:24,000
at all

984
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,918
if the companies themselves can't get

985
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:27,520
together and agree on a common

986
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,399
technology

987
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,560
then governments will should step in and

988
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,279
do it for them

989
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:37,040
so one interpretation of circular

990
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:37,839
economy

991
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,040
um in the case of technology is that it

992
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,000
allows

993
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:45,599
technological self-determinism you know

994
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:47,599
in other words it's the people who can

995
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,199
decide on

996
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,520
what technology to use and what to do

997
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,719
with it you know

998
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,760
repair it et cetera et cetera

999
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,960
which i think is great no technological

1000
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,359
self-determinism

1001
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:03,280
sounds like a great empower idea

1002
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:07,200
um but also uh

1003
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:10,960
i'm thinking if if if the circular

1004
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,520
economy is a good business

1005
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:16,960
a circular economy can be a circular

1006
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,640
monopoly where these

1007
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:22,480
big texts dominate every part of the

1008
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:26,000
repair circle of that economy

1009
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,560
what are your thoughts about it yeah

1010
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:29,920
that's actually that's a really good

1011
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:31,520
point paz and i have to confess that i

1012
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,320
haven't thought

1013
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:35,680
too much about that but i think that um

1014
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,839
there are definitely dangers when we

1015
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,000
have too much corporate power

1016
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,240
concentrated in any sector you know i'm

1017
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,680
currently working on a report for the

1018
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:44,000
united

1019
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,400
nations about food and i've been really

1020
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,680
struck to learn

1021
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,560
how that a small hand really a small

1022
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:51,920
handful of companies

1023
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,560
controls the global pesticide trade the

1024
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
global seed trade

1025
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,560
the global agriculture or veterinary

1026
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,760
medicines trade

1027
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,320
uh the farm machinery trade and so forth

1028
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,000
and and that's not healthy

1029
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:06,160
um we need you know one of the things

1030
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,200
that's really

1031
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,240
important to innovation is having uh

1032
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,320
opportunities for small companies and

1033
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,359
startup companies

1034
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:16,000
to bring their uh innovations their

1035
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,160
ingenuity to crack the crack

1036
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,560
into these to enter into these markets

1037
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,240
um so i think that

1038
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,800
and again you know i i'm sounding like

1039
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,079
i'm putting a lot of weight on the

1040
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:28,640
shoulders of government but

1041
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
you know we definitely need to be

1042
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,480
concerned about

1043
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,800
ensuring competition and if that means

1044
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,119
breaking up some of these monopolies

1045
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,880
that's maybe what we have to do you know

1046
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,800
another example of that we've seen

1047
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,800
the way that corporations take advantage

1048
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
of low corporate tax rates

1049
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,440
to um avoid paying any taxes at all some

1050
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,400
of these large

1051
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,800
technology corporations are uh among the

1052
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,000
most guilty in that

1053
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,480
in that regard so um you know it's

1054
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,640
encouraging to see governments in the g7

1055
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,000
last week say that they're

1056
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,920
they're going to establish minimum

1057
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,680
levels of corporate taxation that's

1058
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,960
something that should happen

1059
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:05,520
in every country across the world uh in

1060
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,880
in much the same way that

1061
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:08,000
governments are going to have to take

1062
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,359
action to deal with excessive

1063
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,200
concentration of corporate power

1064
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:14,720
in the technological sector

1065
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,839
david if let's say

1066
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:22,079
i'm in the u.s no so i want to repair my

1067
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:22,880
cell phone

1068
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:25,839
which basically i have to to renew my

1069
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:27,359
cell phone every year because the

1070
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:28,880
battery whatever and all that

1071
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,440
um so i want to to repair my assault

1072
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,000
phone

1073
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,599
so the uh

1074
00:37:35,599 --> 00:37:38,240
manufacture industry is probably there

1075
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,160
and the software industry is probably

1076
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:40,800
there

1077
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,040
and they probably gonna provide if

1078
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,880
everything is okay and they are agree

1079
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,760
with this

1080
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,920
right to repair they're gonna provide

1081
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,839
the to the consumers with the i don't

1082
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:51,280
know the instructions

1083
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:56,240
uh you know the the explanations etc

1084
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,480
everything that you need to repair your

1085
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,000
own device

1086
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,240
but what happened in the global south

1087
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,119
for example

1088
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:05,839
here in chile where we don't produce

1089
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,640
technology

1090
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:09,920
you know we just produce uh mainly uh

1091
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:14,000
uh natural uh resources etc but

1092
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,440
see my phone probably they

1093
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,160
the industry of the the the hardware is

1094
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,200
produced

1095
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,520
i don't know in india china china

1096
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,839
probably but the software is produced in

1097
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,119
i don't know the uk so it's

1098
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:31,480
super difficult to have that kind of

1099
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,640
accountability

1100
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:36,000
from the from the companies to give us

1101
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,599
in spanish you know the instructions you

1102
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:40,560
know the whole

1103
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,599
um you know materials

1104
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,640
to repair our products uh what what what

1105
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:47,520
do you think about

1106
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,280
you know this again know these

1107
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,800
inequalities uh

1108
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,839
uh around the the the circular economy

1109
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:56,400
with north the global north and the

1110
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,520
global south

1111
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,280
yeah i mean i think there are there are

1112
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:01,680
definitely potential inequalities but

1113
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,760
you know if if i take one example paz

1114
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,200
like um

1115
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,839
watch repairs so you know watches may

1116
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:09,839
not be manufactured in chile but i bet

1117
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:11,920
you in santiago you can find somebody to

1118
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:13,200
change the battery on your watch or

1119
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,119
repair your watch

1120
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,440
those kinds of those kinds of abilities

1121
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,520
those kinds of skills are not limited

1122
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,240
to wealthy countries so i think that you

1123
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:23,200
know as long as

1124
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:25,280
these products were manufactured in such

1125
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,320
a way that it was

1126
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,560
possible to repair them that you would

1127
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,720
see a really healthy

1128
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,960
uh sector in all countries in the world

1129
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,480
because there's bright young people

1130
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,480
who are capable of learning you know

1131
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,760
through youtube videos

1132
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,040
how to repair a smartphone how to repair

1133
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,880
a laptop computer so i think that

1134
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,400
actually if

1135
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,720
if governments in the in the wealthy

1136
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,440
countries

1137
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,680
put the impetus on these corporations to

1138
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,960
make their projects

1139
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:54,560
their pro their to make their

1140
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,119
products repairable i think they would

1141
00:39:57,119 --> 00:39:57,839
actually be

1142
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:00,880
a a job creator right across the world

1143
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,000
that you would have

1144
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,079
whether you're in santiago chile whether

1145
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:06,400
you're in mumbai india or whether you're

1146
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:06,960
in

1147
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,119
johannesburg south africa you could take

1148
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,160
it down to a

1149
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,040
some shop and that they would have like

1150
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,480
some smart young people there

1151
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,319
who could change the battery or fix the

1152
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,079
problem i i'm sure that would actually

1153
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:18,960
happen

1154
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:20,960
in terms of inequality you know i have

1155
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,000
to admit

1156
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,640
i'm much more concerned about the the

1157
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,640
ongoing disparities of

1158
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,640
wealth between the global north and the

1159
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,400
global south and

1160
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,400
and the way that countries in the global

1161
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,240
north are contributing to

1162
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
and exacerbating these global

1163
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,000
environmental crises that we've touched

1164
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,839
on and not taking a sufficient degree of

1165
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:43,040
responsibility

1166
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,040
for solving these problems you know the

1167
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,560
climate emergency

1168
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,960
is caused by wealthy people in wealthy

1169
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:49,920
countries

1170
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:54,480
and we have a moral and legal obligation

1171
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:57,119
to solve the problem uh by reducing our

1172
00:40:57,119 --> 00:40:58,079
emissions

1173
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:01,040
also by assisting uh countries in the

1174
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:03,040
global south to adapt to the

1175
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:05,359
inevitable impacts of climate change and

1176
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:07,839
also people forget about this there's a

1177
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:09,920
there's three pillars of climate action

1178
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:11,760
one is mitigation which is reducing

1179
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,640
emissions

1180
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,880
one is adaptation which is preparing for

1181
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:15,680
climate change

1182
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,839
and the third pillar which people forget

1183
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:19,680
about is something called loss and

1184
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,480
damage

1185
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,160
which is part of the un framework

1186
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,760
convention on climate change

1187
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:26,560
and it's basically compensating people

1188
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,800
in low-income countries and small island

1189
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,000
developing states

1190
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:31,920
for the damage that climate change is

1191
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
already having on their lives

1192
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,640
wealthy countries made a pledge in paris

1193
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,079
in 2015

1194
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,400
to mobilize a hundred billion dollars a

1195
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:42,079
year in climate finance

1196
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:45,119
for adaptation in the global south

1197
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:47,119
we haven't we haven't kept that promise

1198
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,160
that's a real

1199
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,760
uh that should be that should be

1200
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,119
headline news that should be an

1201
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:52,000
embarrassment

1202
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:54,400
to people in the north loss and damage

1203
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:55,440
is even worse

1204
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:58,400
not a single dollar not a single euro

1205
00:41:58,400 --> 00:41:58,880
not a

1206
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,280
not a single penny has changed hands to

1207
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:02,800
compensate people and

1208
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,560
i've witnessed you know the damage

1209
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,040
that's been uh inflicted by

1210
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,240
uh severe tropical cyclones in fiji for

1211
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:10,960
example

1212
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:13,119
where people have been rendered homeless

1213
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,880
through no fault of their own but

1214
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:16,720
through

1215
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,800
severe storms that are being made more

1216
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,480
severe and more frequent by climate

1217
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,040
change

1218
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:24,240
we have to we really have to address

1219
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,079
both the adaptation and the loss and

1220
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:27,520
damage things which will

1221
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,599
effectively transfer some amount of

1222
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,680
wealth from the north to the south

1223
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,160
uh questions are coming from the

1224
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,440
audience but before that

1225
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:45,920
um i i i i i want to talk about

1226
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:48,240
activism because i i think it's so so

1227
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:49,280
important

1228
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
um and we cannot talk about

1229
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,319
environmental activism without

1230
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:56,319
recognizing the fundamental role of

1231
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,119
activists

1232
00:42:57,119 --> 00:42:59,520
especially land defenders and indigenous

1233
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:00,560
communities

1234
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,400
what do you think has been the role of

1235
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,440
technologies in their activism

1236
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,359
well i think technology has been a

1237
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,200
double-edged sword for these

1238
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:11,119
defenders of land for defenders of human

1239
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:12,880
rights it's been a really positive

1240
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
development because it connects people

1241
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,359
together

1242
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:17,359
it has been used in in many cases around

1243
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:18,640
the world

1244
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,560
to enhance their security to protect

1245
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,000
themselves but also to build their

1246
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,640
networks

1247
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:24,720
to get larger numbers of people

1248
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,240
supporting their efforts

1249
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
that's the positive side of these

1250
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
technologies the negative side

1251
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,079
is that these same technologies are

1252
00:43:32,079 --> 00:43:34,000
being used and exploited by governments

1253
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,119
and businesses

1254
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:38,160
to suppress these defenders to

1255
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,839
you know to monitor the work that

1256
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,680
they're doing uh to track their

1257
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,520
movements and so there's

1258
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,040
as i said it's a double-edged sword that

1259
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,200
has some very positive aspects

1260
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:51,439
but also some very negative aspects

1261
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:55,440
uh a question from the audience is

1262
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:58,480
really related to activism and circular

1263
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,520
economy

1264
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:03,040
they ask how are indigenous people

1265
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:05,440
involved in defending what a proper

1266
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,319
circular economy should be

1267
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,400
aha that's a great question and you know

1268
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:11,440
i would say i

1269
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,119
i would actually say that indigenous

1270
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,800
people are the original

1271
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,720
inspiration for the circular economy

1272
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,160
because if you look at

1273
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,480
the way that in digital indigenous

1274
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:21,599
cultures

1275
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:23,520
and indigenous economies operated for

1276
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:25,440
literally tens of thousands of years

1277
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,720
around the world

1278
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,920
they were they were everything that they

1279
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,640
made and they used was capable of being

1280
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:33,599
reused

1281
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:36,480
recycled or composted so you know there

1282
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:37,920
aren't any indigenous

1283
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:39,680
nuclear waste dumps there aren't any

1284
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:41,680
indigenous contaminated sites

1285
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:43,599
anywhere in the world there are

1286
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:44,880
certainly indigenous

1287
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:47,200
peoples who have been impacted by

1288
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:48,160
western

1289
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:50,319
contaminated sites western nuclear dumps

1290
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:52,000
but they have not created

1291
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:54,800
any of their own so um i think that we

1292
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,160
draw that inspiration

1293
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,720
from indigenous wisdom um to the extent

1294
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
that indigenous people are involved in

1295
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,240
the transition to a circular economy

1296
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,680
that's something that

1297
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,440
is definitely taking place around the

1298
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:07,359
world we have indigenous

1299
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,200
communities and indigenous people at the

1300
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,800
forefront of the transition

1301
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:13,839
to renewable energy for example and

1302
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:15,839
so i expect that indigenous people will

1303
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:18,160
be highly engaged in the transition to a

1304
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,440
circular economy as well

1305
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,040
another question is how do you reconcile

1306
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:25,359
the

1307
00:45:25,359 --> 00:45:28,480
message of combating climate change as

1308
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:28,880
an

1309
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:31,760
individual responsibility with the

1310
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:32,560
structural

1311
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:35,680
change needed across many extractive and

1312
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:39,280
extractive extractive industries

1313
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,079
um to prevent catastrophic loss of

1314
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:44,079
biodiversity and damage

1315
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:47,599
of our planet that's a big question no

1316
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:49,520
yeah it's a big question and it's really

1317
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,800
striking though because

1318
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,800
you know the the big oil companies the

1319
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:54,480
big fossil fuel companies they would

1320
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,520
love this to be an

1321
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:57,440
issue of individual responsibility

1322
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,839
because it absolves them of

1323
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,000
responsibility

1324
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:01,920
and that's that goes back to my earlier

1325
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:04,160
point about transformative and systemic

1326
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:04,960
changes

1327
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,359
we need we need more than individual

1328
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,400
action we need

1329
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,880
collective action we need systemic

1330
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,599
change

1331
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:14,000
so you know it's really again i keep

1332
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,680
coming back to these signs of progress

1333
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,160
but

1334
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,760
you know there are now more than 30

1335
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:19,839
countries that are committed to ending

1336
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:20,480
the use of

1337
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,839
coal coal-fired electricity generation

1338
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,319
by 2030. that's that's a really

1339
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:27,520
encouraging sign because

1340
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,200
coal is coal is a is a double

1341
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,200
double danger it's terrible in terms of

1342
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,359
air pollution and it's terrible in terms

1343
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:36,640
of climate change

1344
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:40,160
um so you know and individuals

1345
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,319
you and i don't have the power to say

1346
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:44,240
that coal coal-fired power plants should

1347
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,440
shut down that's something that

1348
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,520
government action is necessary for

1349
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:49,440
but you know the the brilliant fridays

1350
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,880
for the future movement the

1351
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,560
that kind of energy passion and

1352
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:54,160
creativity of young people

1353
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,079
i think they deserve credit for the fact

1354
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:58,880
that we are now seeing countries moving

1355
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,040
faster to address the climate emergency

1356
00:47:01,040 --> 00:47:03,040
it was young people in germany that

1357
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:05,119
brought that lawsuit it was young people

1358
00:47:05,119 --> 00:47:07,200
in colombia that brought a lawsuit

1359
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,040
leading to the colombian supreme court

1360
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:10,720
ordering colombia to end

1361
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:13,760
deforestation in the amazon young people

1362
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,359
are really at the forefront of

1363
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:18,880
the the climate movement and that

1364
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:22,160
that movement is resulting in not only

1365
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,839
individual changes because these young

1366
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:24,880
people are really

1367
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,559
you know they're they they're walking

1368
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:28,000
the talk they are taking actions

1369
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:28,960
themselves i mean

1370
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,559
i meet so many young people who are

1371
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,880
vegans and vegetarians because of

1372
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:35,359
the climate emergency um so many young

1373
00:47:35,359 --> 00:47:37,040
people who won't fly to conferences

1374
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,079
they're you know they're happy to

1375
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:40,000
participate virtually but they won't fly

1376
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:40,960
to a conference

1377
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,640
greta turnburg of course who sailed

1378
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:44,319
across the atlantic ocean

1379
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,240
um you know the leader of the friday's

1380
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,440
for future movements so

1381
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,240
i think that we are in a position where

1382
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,760
we need systemic changes we need

1383
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:52,480
countries to

1384
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,240
phase out coal-fired electricity we need

1385
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:55,839
countries to stop you know this was

1386
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:57,599
really fascinating just a few uh

1387
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:00,000
a few weeks ago the international energy

1388
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,520
agency you know the world's leading

1389
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:03,119
energy expert says

1390
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:06,720
we have to stop exploring for

1391
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:09,280
and creating new fossil fuel

1392
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,480
infrastructure

1393
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:13,520
that message is so powerful in terms of

1394
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:16,559
changing the system so that people

1395
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,240
people who are ordinary citizens like

1396
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,599
you and i when we

1397
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,720
when we when we turn on our uh when we

1398
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:24,160
turn on our lights at night we know

1399
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,920
we're getting clean electricity we don't

1400
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:26,720
have to make a

1401
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:30,160
a choice when we when we go when

1402
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,520
when we're making transportation

1403
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,520
decisions the all of our choices

1404
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,920
should be clean transportation choices

1405
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,040
you know and so that's

1406
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,800
that's systemic changes that are needed

1407
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,240
to to make us

1408
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:43,680
um to empower us as as

1409
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,520
green citizens i know we have a little

1410
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,000
time but

1411
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,040
i i i i want to go back to

1412
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,480
one answer that you met you uh gave

1413
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:57,680
about um how uh technologies is

1414
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:01,280
playing also a role of civilians

1415
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:05,119
uh against uh land defenders and

1416
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:08,960
you know environmental activists um

1417
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:11,119
do you think that today environmental

1418
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:12,079
activists

1419
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:15,520
have the necessary support in terms of

1420
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:19,359
digital security uh i think in some

1421
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,960
places they do but i think there's a lot

1422
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:22,319
of places in the world where

1423
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:24,319
activists need more support in terms of

1424
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:25,920
digital security and that's something

1425
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,480
where the

1426
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,880
you know the the the digital and

1427
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:30,720
technological community could really

1428
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:31,440
provide

1429
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,599
a helping hand and this is a very

1430
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:34,720
serious issue

1431
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,440
people are shocked to learn that

1432
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:38,400
environmental

1433
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:40,800
human rights defenders who are you know

1434
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,720
ordinary people who are you know trying

1435
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,079
to protect their land

1436
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:46,559
trying to protect our environment from

1437
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:48,400
uh irreparable harm

1438
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,640
they are being murdered hundreds of

1439
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,920
people every year the last

1440
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,480
the last report that i saw was over 300

1441
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,079
people murdered last year

1442
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:59,040
for for for being activists to protect

1443
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,240
land air and water

1444
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:01,839
um and that's the tip of the iceberg

1445
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,440
right because beyond that there's many

1446
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:04,079
more

1447
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:06,559
activists and human rights defenders who

1448
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:07,520
are being

1449
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,400
threatened harassed intimidated uh put

1450
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,280
in jail

1451
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,440
and so you know improving the digital

1452
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,280
security of those people is a really

1453
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:19,119
uh really important step yeah absolutely

1454
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:21,920
and many of those land defenders are

1455
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:22,640
women

1456
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,640
that are you know facing rape you know

1457
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,599
menaces and etc so i think it's super

1458
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,800
super serious

1459
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,520
yeah i was on a call recently with four

1460
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,680
female human rights defenders from

1461
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:38,960
uh el salvador honda honduras guatemala

1462
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,240
and nicaragua

1463
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,720
and all four of them told stories that

1464
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,359
that really just

1465
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:47,200
were hard to hear hard to listen to i

1466
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:50,000
mean powerful emotional stories of

1467
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,920
violence that had been inflicted upon

1468
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:53,760
them simply because they were trying to

1469
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:55,359
protect water or protect

1470
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,920
air or protect the biological diversity

1471
00:50:57,920 --> 00:50:59,200
that their communities

1472
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,680
and in many cases indigenous communities

1473
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,640
depend on

1474
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:04,240
you know this is this is where we're at

1475
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,319
we're we're at a place in

1476
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,800
human history where these people are

1477
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,160
heroes for the planet

1478
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,240
but they're being treated like criminals

1479
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,200
and terrorists

1480
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,319
and we really need a lot more people to

1481
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:19,760
stand up and and speak up on behalf of

1482
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,559
those people

1483
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:22,160
who are putting their lives and their

1484
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:23,920
and their livelihoods

1485
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,839
on the line for the benefit of all of us

1486
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:31,200
david um in the last year we have

1487
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,079
heard a lot about fake news and this

1488
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:35,920
information campaigns and social

1489
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:38,079
networks etc etc

1490
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,920
do you think that social networks have

1491
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
contributed

1492
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,200
uh to climate change danielism

1493
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:46,559
yeah i think there's no question that

1494
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,800
they have i mean the the algorithms for

1495
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,559
example on facebook that you find is

1496
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:51,520
that people

1497
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:55,040
if people uh have and google as well if

1498
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:56,960
people have looked up one article that

1499
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,400
says you know climate change is

1500
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,200
fake um then then they'll the next time

1501
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,480
they do a search they'll get

1502
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:05,040
that that perspective will be reinforced

1503
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,640
over and over again that happens on

1504
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,400
google that happens on facebook

1505
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:10,480
and so these big social media companies

1506
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,680
they have to do something

1507
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:13,200
we have to find a way to change this

1508
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,319
because people need to be acting on

1509
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:18,400
solid information we're seeing that

1510
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:20,880
again with the covet 19 pandemic

1511
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,880
i mean the amount of misinformation

1512
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:24,480
that's out there on the internet

1513
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:26,880
about the safety of vaccines is

1514
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,079
incredible

1515
00:52:28,079 --> 00:52:30,640
listen people the vaccines are safe the

1516
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:32,079
vaccines are saving

1517
00:52:32,079 --> 00:52:34,800
millions of lives and it's just grossly

1518
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,000
irresponsible

1519
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,119
for these companies to be

1520
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:41,440
amplifying and perpetuating these myths

1521
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:42,559
about vaccines i

1522
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:44,960
i think it's a it's an absolutely

1523
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:47,839
criminal situation

1524
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,599
so here's another questions uh from the

1525
00:52:51,599 --> 00:52:52,319
audience

1526
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:55,920
um i think it's teresa so many smart

1527
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:58,000
appliances are exported

1528
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,319
and available in developing countries

1529
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:02,640
where programs like the cradle to cradle

1530
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,319
are not available

1531
00:53:04,319 --> 00:53:06,880
what can be done to assist in

1532
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:07,760
establishing

1533
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,800
such programs to safely dispose of this

1534
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:11,599
waste

1535
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:14,480
in these countries around the world yeah

1536
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:15,920
that's a great question and that comes

1537
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,280
back to something that i was

1538
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,599
referring to earlier which is this

1539
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,119
concept of extended producer

1540
00:53:21,119 --> 00:53:22,880
responsibility so i've been doing some

1541
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:24,400
work with the government of kenya on

1542
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:24,880
this

1543
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:27,440
because the reality is that you know in

1544
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,760
in countries in the global south they

1545
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:32,000
they face so many challenges right now

1546
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,920
they face poverty they face

1547
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,240
lack of uh lack of education you know

1548
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:37,119
right across

1549
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:39,520
the infrastructure is not adequate so

1550
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,559
these governments

1551
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:42,800
really can't take on the additional

1552
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:45,359
burden of being responsible for running

1553
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:47,839
recycling programs but the companies

1554
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:49,359
that are manufacturing and

1555
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,440
importing these products whether it's

1556
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,559
you know these are

1557
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:55,359
these are big global corporations that

1558
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,720
are that are in

1559
00:53:56,720 --> 00:53:58,720
that are in canada and europe they are

1560
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,079
already operating

1561
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,720
these kinds of um consumer take back

1562
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:03,359
systems

1563
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:05,520
so there's absolutely no reason that

1564
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:07,839
governments in kenya south africa mexico

1565
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,119
chile

1566
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,520
you know all across the global south

1567
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,640
should be saying to these

1568
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,880
global corporations look if you want to

1569
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,680
sell your

1570
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:17,440
smart washing machine or your smart

1571
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:19,760
refrigerator in this country

1572
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:22,000
then you have to put together a program

1573
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,760
that when that refrigerator or that

1574
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,880
washing machine

1575
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,040
breaks or it reaches the end of its uh

1576
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:28,079
life cycle

1577
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:30,400
you take it back you pay for the system

1578
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,280
to collect it

1579
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,440
you pay for the system to recycle it and

1580
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,040
that's how we'll get progress

1581
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:38,079
towards a circular economy that's fair

1582
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,799
right around the globe and we talked

1583
00:54:40,799 --> 00:54:42,720
about plastic earlier i'm really excited

1584
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:43,280
about

1585
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:47,119
the fact that next year in nairobi kenya

1586
00:54:47,119 --> 00:54:48,720
at the united nations environment

1587
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:51,040
assembly i believe that negotiations are

1588
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,200
going to launch on a new global treaty

1589
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:54,640
to deal with plastics

1590
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,920
that should result in global standards

1591
00:54:57,920 --> 00:54:59,280
so that we have like

1592
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,200
global standards for the different types

1593
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:02,880
of plastic that are being used

1594
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:04,960
and also global standards that will

1595
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,079
impose upon these

1596
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:10,400
corporations requirements to um to

1597
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,760
build and establish

1598
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,760
complete complete and comprehensive

1599
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:18,799
recycling systems

1600
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,920
david i know we have only five minutes

1601
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:22,319
left

1602
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:26,319
but i i really want to to to hear

1603
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,160
your message to the right skunk

1604
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,599
community no

1605
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,880
regarding why we should look at the

1606
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:34,240
environmental agenda

1607
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,760
and what is the uh role of technology in

1608
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:38,880
this i know we have

1609
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,359
been talking around you know about this

1610
00:55:41,359 --> 00:55:43,119
in the whole and the whole panel but i

1611
00:55:43,119 --> 00:55:44,240
really would like to

1612
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,359
to ask you to stress a message uh for

1613
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:48,960
the right cell community

1614
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:50,799
uh because i think this is such an

1615
00:55:50,799 --> 00:55:52,000
important issue

1616
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:54,400
uh for me we should have to you know we

1617
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,319
should talk about this

1618
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,200
in the whole you know a conference

1619
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,160
because it's

1620
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:04,000
it's key so what what is the message

1621
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,119
that you can give

1622
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,359
to the right scone community well i

1623
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:09,440
think my basic message is this paz

1624
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:11,680
look the the rights con community as i

1625
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:13,440
understand it is incredibly diverse you

1626
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:14,400
know people from

1627
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,559
every walk of life every corner of the

1628
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:18,480
world but here are some things we have

1629
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:19,359
in common

1630
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:22,400
we all depend on clean air to breathe we

1631
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:24,960
all depend on clean water to drink

1632
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:29,280
we all need nutritious and

1633
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:32,559
healthy food to to sustain our bodies we

1634
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:33,040
all

1635
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,359
ultimately depend on healthy ecosystems

1636
00:56:35,359 --> 00:56:36,400
and biodiversity

1637
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:38,240
for a whole range of services that are

1638
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:39,839
invisible to us that we don't think

1639
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:40,400
about

1640
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,240
you know you know in in my office with

1641
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:44,319
my computer i don't think about the fact

1642
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:44,720
that

1643
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:47,119
wetlands are purifying water that birds

1644
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:49,200
and bats and bees are pollinating the

1645
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:49,839
crops

1646
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,480
that are that are ultimately coming

1647
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:54,400
through the grocery store into my house

1648
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,640
and feeding myself and my family we have

1649
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,960
so much in common as human beings in

1650
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,440
terms

1651
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:02,799
of our dependence on air water soil and

1652
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:04,319
biological diversity

1653
00:57:04,319 --> 00:57:06,400
as well as a stable climate and

1654
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,720
non-toxic environments in which we can

1655
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:11,040
live work study play and flourish and

1656
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:12,319
all of those elements

1657
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:14,400
are part of something that we call the

1658
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,559
right to live in a healthy environment

1659
00:57:16,559 --> 00:57:19,040
and i really think that for for anyone

1660
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,240
no matter what your

1661
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:22,799
interest is in technology we need to

1662
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:23,839
think of ways

1663
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:27,040
that technology can be harnessed to

1664
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:29,520
improve and restore our environment

1665
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,040
because we know that it's

1666
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:33,040
in trouble we everybody knows there's a

1667
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:34,160
climate emergency

1668
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,480
everybody knows that biodiversity is

1669
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,079
declining everybody knows that there's

1670
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:39,680
too much pollution in the world

1671
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,440
and what we've talked a lot about today

1672
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,359
has is that we have solutions to those

1673
00:57:43,359 --> 00:57:44,240
problems

1674
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,799
but we need to accelerate the pace of

1675
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,720
implementation of those solutions and we

1676
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,319
also have to really

1677
00:57:50,319 --> 00:57:53,680
look at our world with clear glasses

1678
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,240
and recognize that there are a billion

1679
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,000
people in this world today

1680
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:00,319
who don't have access to safe water

1681
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,839
there's close to a billion people who

1682
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:02,640
don't have

1683
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,400
enough food to stop them from going to

1684
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,920
bed hungry

1685
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,760
and those are the people that are

1686
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:09,280
suffering the most because of these

1687
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,799
global environmental problems these are

1688
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:12,079
the people for whom

1689
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,640
climate change is is making their lives

1690
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,640
eat that much more difficult because

1691
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:18,880
water is becoming more scarce or because

1692
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:20,400
fish that they've depended on to feed

1693
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:21,119
their families

1694
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:23,760
are becoming more scarce and so you know

1695
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,880
my message is we're

1696
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:27,839

of privilege

1700
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:33,760
and we need to examine that privilege

1701
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,280
and think about what it means

1702
