1
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:11,759
okay

2
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:17,440
how's the sound good okay

3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,880
action this

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,160
soil here

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:31,840
take a deep breath

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,200
this soil here holds our lungs

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,399
this soil here gives us

8
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,879
breath this soil here

9
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,239
remembers a woman

10
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,360
this soil here remembers a woman

11
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,480
who foolish men once called

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,680
crazy a woman

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,359
who understood that destroying the very

14
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:02,160
thing

15
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,878
that gives you breath is

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,960
because this soil here was almost

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,159
destroyed

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,200
to make way for a business complex or

19
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,159
a parking lot or an expressway to the

20
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,159
airport

21
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,799
now that's

22
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,720
this soil here

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,439
is for you

24
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,479
this soil here remembers that woman

25
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,040
who inspired other women to come

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,960
together to protect

27
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,399
this soil and that soil there

28
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,759
and the soil we don't even know about

29
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,399
this soil here is proof of their victory

30
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
this story this soil here

31
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,240
still holds the imprints of their feet

32
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,800
dancing the dance of victory

33
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,319
but this soil here also holds

34
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,560
shame this soil here

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,760
remembers the mothers

36
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,879
in 1992 women made

37
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,560
this soil here their home

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
for 11 months they protested in defiance

39
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,080
in refusal in demand that their

40
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,760
sons be released from illegal detainment

41
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,440
on this soil here they refused to eat

42
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:50,319
no freedom no food

43
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,000
this soil here was drenched

44
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,239
by their tears stained by their blood

45
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,440
trampled by the boots of those

46
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,840
supposed to protect them

47
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,200
this soil here saw

48
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,319
their naked bodies mothers

49
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,680
who had no choice but to strip naked

50
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,560
to save their children's lives

51
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:24,159
this soil here

52
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,720
was witness to that curse

53
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,480
this soil here is

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,040
witness to their power

55
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,239
this soil here remembers

56
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,760
what happens when a government makes the

57
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,720
mistake

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,840
of ignoring women

59
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:52,159
this soil here remembers what happens

60
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,720
when promises are broken

61
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,480
but this soil here doesn't need you to

62
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,480
be a moheshimiwa

63
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,400
this soil here doesn't need you to have

64
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,319
an id the soil here

65
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:08,159
doesn't need you to have even gone to

66
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,760
school this

67
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,959
soil here is for you as you

68
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,399

however you need it this

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,039
soil here is for you

71
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:28,960
this soil here is for you because of a

72
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,840
woman

73
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,359
a woman whose name is

74
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,880
this soil here is for you to lie down

75
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:37,600
here

76
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,840
and paint your dreams in the clouds over

77
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
there

78
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,840
this soil is for you to bring your metoo

79
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,560
here

80
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,199
to teach them how to ride a bicycle to

81
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,479
dust the soil

82
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,479
off their clothes when they fall down

83
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,199
if you listen carefully in this soil

84
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
you can hear whispered prayers

85
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:20,320
and hearts breaking you can

86
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,000
hear the dreams and hopes

87
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,840
of so many people who call

88
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
this soil here

89
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,800
home this soil here

90
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,880
remembers what we did yesterday

91
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,639
this soil here will remember

92
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,479
what we do tomorrow

93
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:52,800
this soil here will remember today

94
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,000
this soil here will remember what we do

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,240
tomorrow this is a memory poem

96
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,759
in honor of wangari madhai because she

97
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:04,479
knew

98
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:09,599
the soil always remembers

99
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,919
my name is aleya kasam and i

100
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,840
am the a in the lamb sisterhood

101
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,120
so i'm such a face toucher so i have to

102
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,639
consciously remember not to when i'm

103
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,280
shooting okay

104
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:48,960
when it feels like there is so much to

105
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
be done

106
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,599
i always remember to take it just

107
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:59,039
one step at a time like makatili womensa

108
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,039
this is her story

109
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,560
so the british showed up in what would

110
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,039
become kenya in the early 1900s

111
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,919
as part of the imperial british east

112
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
africa company

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:16,000
company for profit

114
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,319
like any occupying force they use the

115
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,599
same old tricks you know

116
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,080
forcing people off their land making

117
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,639
them pay taxes for what they now called

118
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
crown property forcing them to break

119
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:27,919
their

120
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,280
backs farming rubber and sisal to

121
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,960
fatten colonizer pockets

122
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,880
mkhitilili menza was just an ordinary

123
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,759
old woman in her 70s and she had had

124
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:46,960
enough it enraged her

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,240
that these white people were coming here

126
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:53,120
to try and replace all the mizikenda

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
chita madunu

128
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,080
utsumu and chikohu

129
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,800
their political culture economy and

130
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,800
religion

131
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:05,599
so she gathered her people together

132
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,639
using the sacred funeral kifudu dance

133
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
and she told them

134
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,800
i am not i'm ganga

135
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,160
and i have no medicine but i am not

136
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,919
afraid to speak the truth

137
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,960
and to fight for my people my

138
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:29,919
powers come from kaya rooted in the

139
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,680
spirits of our ancestors

140
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,719
giryama is for giriyama

141
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,559
and we shall not be moved

142
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,839
hers was not a call to war it was a

143
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,958
raising

144
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:46,320
of consciousness and from that

145
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,320
one no the women joined her

146
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
and then the men followed soon

147
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,279
the british had a rather embarrassing

148
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,360
situation on their hands

149
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,040
nobody was showing up to work in their

150
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,360
plantations nobody was showing up to

151
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:03,839
carry

152
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:07,040
bags in the hot sun and nobody

153
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,880
paid taxes everybody just said

154
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,720
no but the british didn't know how to

155
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
deal with this new business

156
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,480
see it was 1913. there was a big

157
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,600
war on the horizon and each colonizing

158
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,240
power had the same need

159
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,279
disposable bodies to fight

160
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,720
their wars mechatilly watched in

161
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,600
horror as they began recruiting her sons

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,360
into their war and when the british

163
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,640
administration author

164
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,880

166
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,880
on august 13 1913

167
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,560
makatili was there you know what she did

168
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,399

00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,320

175
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,040
hen

176
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
the champion just laughed at this old

177
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,360
woman and reached for the hen

178
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,839
the mother had pecked at him and he

179
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
snapped his hand away

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,399
makatili looked at him and said

181
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,519
if you dare take away any

182
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:33,360
one of our sons that is what will happen

183
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,480
to you hey he

184
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,720
was furious and so he shot at the hen

185
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,920
so she this old woman walked

186
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
up to him looked him dead in the eye and

187
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
slapped him oh

188
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,079
wow so then

189
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,279
then one of champions men grabbed

190
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:00,399
makatili and

191
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:04,079
held her in place champion

192
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,120
making sure that she was watching pulled

193
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,079
out his gun

194
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,760
and fired into the crowd again

195
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,800
and again and again

196
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,320
who knows how many were killed that day

197
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,000
they imprisoned her but she

198
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,839
at 70 years old escaped

199
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,320
but she still

200
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,959
had to walk she was imprisoned in kc

201
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,800
home was khalifi even a straight line

202
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,720
google search tells you that's at least

203
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,240
831 kilometers

204
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,160
the average person walks about three

205
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,600
kilometers per hour

206
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,240
so even if she walked without stopping

207
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,040
eating

208
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,839
sleeping peeing it would still take

209
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
11. days

210
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,480
do you know what that much walking does

211
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,200
to a body

212
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:07,680
you stop being a person

213
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,360
you become just a body

214
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,519
walking you become

215
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,079
nobody

216
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,600
meanwhile the british had increased

217
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,639
their brutality they tried to impose

218
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,680
a treaty and told their grandma that

219
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,519
they had to pay a fine for resisting

220
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
british colonial rule 10

221
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:43,440
000 rupees or 3 300 goats

222
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,240
how do you refuse how do you resist

223
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,680
one no at a time one fight

224
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:56,000
at a time one step at a time

225
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,920
the giryama resisted and mechetely

226
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,519
walked the british then set flames

227
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:06,160
to homes and granaries destroyed the

228
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,639
sacred shrine of kaya fungo

229
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:11,680
massacred 600 people and burnt

230
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:14,639
the dead giriyama in the same fire as

231
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,440
sheep

232
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
and goats the fight

233
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,680
was not over their fight

234
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,959
was not over

235
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,519
when mecca lily wamenza returned home

236
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,920
she found that she had sparked a

237
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,120
revolution

238
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,600
she had sparked what became one of the

239
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,800
most infamous

240
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,120
uprisings in kenya's history against

241
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,160
colonizers

242
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,680
that she has allowed me us

243
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,959
to be here in the depths of yet another

244
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:47,680
