partners

12
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:46,719
in which we bet how much how many rise

13
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,480

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,920

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,520
javier palero policy director

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,000
access now and i wanna ask here my

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,360
colleague melody who is going to

18
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,640
introduce herself

19
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,800
what is the main thing that has you most

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,520
excited about this year's ricegun

21
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:07,119
thank you javi so yes i'm melody i'm

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:09,920
advocacy director at accessnow and this

23
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,240
year i'm particularly excited about

24
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,799
the diversity of sessions and my

25
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
challenge to myself is to go to a

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,560
session that has nothing to do with the

27
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,439
issues that i'm familiar with

28
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,439
and then another thing that i'm pretty

29
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:24,720
excited about

30
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,240
is uh the yoga sessions the the the yoga

31
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,840
rights concert i'll be looking forward

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,520
to that especially after

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,520
intense panels and intense strategy

34
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,600
sessions i think i'll need it

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,600
and i guess that we are all so tired

36
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,640
right about

37
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,439
having a almost two years of confinement

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,960
in some places of the world with a lot

39
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,200
of

40
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,560
meetings and calls online so i think

41
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:46,960
that

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,920
some yoga is going to be very handy um

43
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,960
for all of us

44
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,240
and for me the most exciting part of the

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,240
meeting is going to be the opportunity

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,680
that we have to get

47
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:00,000
uh people together in the same room

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,360
especially you know

49
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,719
uh big names at companies we have great

50
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:06,159
fireside chats

51
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,000
and uh it's an opportunity for the

52
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,318
community to hold for example companies

53
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,520
accountable right and

54
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,440
getting the people there in the in the

55
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,200
in the meeting to ask questions

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
directly so that's really really cool i

57
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,480
mean also a really

58
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,040
a bit of a fanboy of corey doctorow

59
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,400
who's going to have a fireside chat

60
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,440
later today

61
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,879
with an argentinean activist that is

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,800
also a friend so that's my little

63
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,959
fanboy indulgence that i'm going to have

64
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,400
today

65
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
yes well it's true that even today

66
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:34,400
actually the program is quite rich

67
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,480
and without further ado we're going to

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160

69
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000

thank you javi thank you melody for that

73
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,840
very kind introduction

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
my name is nikki gladstone and as

75
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,760
rightscon director with accessnow it is

76
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,519
my pleasure to welcome you to our 10th

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:59,599
anniversary summit

78
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,360
it's fitting that our 10th anniversary

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,200
event is a record-breaking year across

80
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,000
the board

81
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,280
this year we're hosting more sessions

82
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,599
527

83
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,040
more participants 8515 and more

84
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,720
countries 164 than ever in our history

85
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,640
but what's even more remarkable and what

86
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,680
i would like to take a moment to

87
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,400
celebrate

88
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,480
is the community in those numbers all of

89
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,560
you who well having been disrupted

90
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,959
by the online transition have not been

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:26,000
weakened by it

92
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,080
instead we've seen unprecedented

93
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,239
solidarity in protecting and extending

94
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,440
this new place

95
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,200
this new space that we're calling home

96
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,959
for rightscon

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,040
we use the words community often and we

98
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:38,879
do it intentionally because whether it's

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,400
your tenth rights con

100
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
or your fourth like mine or your first

101
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
the impact of what we can all

102
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,879
achieve in this space isn't confined to

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:48,239
the five days

104
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,319
that are ahead of us for some of you

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,080
those five days are a starting point and

106
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,200
for others

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,040
it's a continuation and deepening of

108
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:56,959
work ongoing

109
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,959
if it is your first rights con which it

110
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,239
is for an extraordinary

111
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:03,120
67 percent of you welcome because you

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,879
being here is part of what i believe to

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,400
be one of the best things about this

114
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,439
community

115
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,280
its willingness to expand and its

116
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,959
willingness to include

117
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,280
three years ago our program hosted very

118
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,000
few sessions

119
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,720
on the environment indigenous rights on

120
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,358
health

121
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,959
now there are themes that intersect

122
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,279
across every program track

123
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,360
whatever issue attracted you here or

124
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,880
even if there is an issue you're

125
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,320
bringing to our agenda for the first

126
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:26,960
time

127
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,800
this is a welcoming platform to move

128
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
forward your work

129
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,120
both this week and in the future

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,880
we're proud of this year's program

131
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,960
because it's rich in content and purpose

132
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,199
as melody mentioned no matter which way

133
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,479
you cut it whether it's the

134
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:43,680
16 program tracks 10 intersecting themes

135
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,400
seven formats or six languages there's a

136
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,000
lot of work to be done here

137
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,840
and i also hope as we all roll up our

138
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,080
sleeves and get ready to do that work

139
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,759
that everyone takes a moment to connect

140
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
to one of the biggest pieces of feedback

141
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,639
that we got

142
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
out of writescon last year when we moved

143
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,680
it online

144
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,440
was a desire for us to recreate the

145
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,360
hallway experiences of our in-person

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,560
events

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
we haven't been able to reproduce the

148
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,759
feeling of running into someone familiar

149
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:08,880
in the hallway between

150
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
sessions but we have taken a crack at

151
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
building meaningful connections

152
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,360
in online environments you can message

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,440
another participant at any time

154
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,600
during writescon using our chat feature

155
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,440
across and across the program

156
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,800
you'll find open spaces that are

157
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,639
designed specifically for building your

158
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,199
personal community within ours

159
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
as a parting note i want to take a

160
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,160
moment to thank the other members of the

161
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,759
writescon team who have put their whole

162
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:32,960
hearts into bringing

163
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,039
the rightscon program and platform to

164
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,560

165

166
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:39,759

167

00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:21,039
rightscon

185
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:22,720
especially those of you who are here for

186
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,240
the first time

187
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,560
by the end of friday there will have

188
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,680
been 23

189
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,720
381 experts activists and policy makers

190
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,800
who have participated in writecon over

191
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,560
the last 10 years

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,960
um from 400 participants when we first

193
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,759
started

194
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,720
and in 2011 to eight and a half thousand

195
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,120
um

196
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,560
in this edition but as nikki said

197
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,120
it's not just a question of um of

198
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,520
numbers it's actually a question of who

199
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,240
um so we've had activists and anarchists

200
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,520
and foreign ministers

201
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,000
and ceos and high commissioners and

202
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,479
special rapporteurs and celebrities

203
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,199
and the nameless and we have people

204
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
participating from

205
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,400
pretty much every country in the world

206
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,160
over these last 10 years

207
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,680
and um i think as many

208
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,319
uh as many as you know as many of you

209
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,000
know we actually

210
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,120
are equally as interested it is in

211
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,840
empowering the grassroots as we are in

212
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,039
holding the powerful

213
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,720
accountable and i think that's one of

214
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,560
the reasons why we've had

215
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
over a thousand session proposals from

216
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,000
the global community

217
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
2021. so what's happened over these 10

218
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,440
years

219
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,440
we've we've developed norms like the

220
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,000
toronto declaration on ai

221
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,840
we've launched movements including the

222
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,280
keeper on coalition

223
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,599
to stop internet shutdowns and i will

224
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,080
say that the definition of a shutdown

225
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,240
was actually um language that was

226
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,160
crafted in a half-day multi-stakeholder

227
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,599
meeting at wright's con

228
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,840
and that language has ended up in every

229
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,720
un resolution since

230
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,039
we've kickstarted campaigns like yid

231
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,800
calling for rights respecting identity

232
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:03,599
systems

233
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:06,479
and ban hashtag ban bs pushing for the

234
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,000
banning of biometric recognition

235
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,960
technologies

236
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,440
in all publicly accessible spaces and

237
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,120
you'll see a lot about that this week

238
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,879
we've mobilized through the arab spring

239
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,400
and it's aftermath

240
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,160
uh through the edward snowden

241
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,560
revelations including having him speak

242
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:22,960
here

243
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,800
in writescon in 2016. we've grappled

244
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,520
with the

245
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,240
cambridge analytica scandal and the

246
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,759
impact of misinformation

247
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:34,399
on the us elections and beyond and we've

248
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:36,080
also celebrated a lot of victories i

249
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,080
don't know how many of you remember the

250
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,640
shouts of joy writes on southeast asia

251
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,719
when the indian supreme court struck

252
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,320
down section 66a

253
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,640
of the information technology act which

254
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,760
was used to

255
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,040
arrest bloggers and critics online

256
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,040
we also know that we haven't necessarily

257
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,800
won that victory forever and there'll be

258
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,240
some information about that

259
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,560
and some private meetings uh on the

260
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,839
situation

261
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,279
in india which is deteriorating but

262
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
together at wright's con we've

263
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,399
determined

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,040
that digital rights are actually human

265
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,519
rights

266
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,560
in the digital age that the corridor

267
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,519
is as important as the stage and the

268
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,480
getting culture

269
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,120
right is as essential as getting

270
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,959
strategy in place

271
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:22,800
we've also learned that a crowdsource

272
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,000
program

273
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,760
is better than a cen is better than a

274
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,399
centralized one

275
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:29,920
this year the 10th anniversary of

276
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,000
rightscon is also the 10th anniversary

277
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,600
of the u.n guiding principles on

278
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
business and human rights

279
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,760
and i think that they permanently change

280
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,040
the way that we talk about corporate

281
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,320
accountability

282
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
and it takes us back to where we started

283
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,480
at wright's con with the silicon valley

284
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:45,920
human rights conference

285
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,640
i myself have all been to all 10 rights

286
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,440
cons

287
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,760
uh but that began in san francisco in

288
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,920
2011 and we can see from what's

289
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:54,480
happening in

290
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,839
india to colombia to palestine and in a

291
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:58,399
world of

292
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:00,000
increased inequality digital

293
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,440
authoritarianism

294
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,680
and institutional crisis that the

295
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,480
silicon v

296
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,800
the silicon valley business model needs

297
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,040
more than a tinkering at the edges

298
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,079
it needs an overhaul

299
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,760
so for the third straight year the un

300
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,519
special procedures coming to rights kind

301
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,279
of issued a joint statement

302
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,959
that was released on friday

303
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,720
which is marking the occasion or maybe

304
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
on sunday yesterday

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,040
this year more than ever we have nine

306
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,160
rapporteurs

307
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
who emphasize that the digital rights

308
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
must be prioritized to rebuild civic

309
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,839
space

310
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,880
amid recovery from the cov19 pandemic

311
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,519
but as you know these threats that we

312
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,279
are facing to digital rights have been

313
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,959
under attack since way before the

314
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:46,079
pandemic

315
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,200
it's an old story and it stirs with

316
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,399
greater intensity

317
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,959
each year we see it on our digital

318
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,800
security helpline

319
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,160
which just this month will have

320
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,000
completed its 10 000th

321
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,200
case in response to technical attacks

322
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,240
and vulnerabilities facing civil society

323
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:06,720
please read our report we're releasing

324
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:07,760
today

325
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,079
on those 10 000 cases it is full of

326
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,640
information and analysis

327
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,320
and here as i do each year i would like

328
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,800
to call for the release of allah abdel

329
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,000
fattah

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,959
who left rights khan in 2011 to face an

331
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,200
egyptian tribunal back home

332
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,399
and has been imprisoned pretty much ever

333
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:30,320
since

334
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,880
as his cousin wrote to me yesterday

335
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,680
allah

336
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,640
is a thinker that not just egypt but the

337
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,760
whole world

338
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,279
is being deprived of a person who were

339
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,880
he not in prison

340
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,040
would have helped us shape the new as we

341
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,160
transition

342
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,240
from the era that we're in to the era

343
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,279
that we're moving into

344
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,600
and such global convulsions that we're

345
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,920
experiencing have thrust new topics onto

346
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,120
our agenda

347
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,200
we've come to to scrutinize the

348
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,839
intersection of public health

349
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,399
data data collection disinformation and

350
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:05,680
technology

351
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,399
and explore the ways to bring the power

352
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,120
of the digital

353
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,959
rights movement to the climate crisis

354
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,399
i also want to note that we've made

355
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,120
mistakes and we've been required to look

356
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,079
in the mirror

357
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,200
on gender on race on how to recognize

358
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,880
arbitrary power

359
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,560
all of these things are questions that

360
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,720
we consider deeply and hopefully

361
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,800
evolving on as a community and also

362
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,120
at rights con i'm really pleased that

363
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,000
over 60

364
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,160
of session proposes um this year

365
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,680
identifies women

366
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,760
that's an extraordinary percentage at a

367
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:38,800
tech conference

368
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,240
and it's even higher if you look at the

369
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:41,920
sessions by those who identify as

370
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,880
non-binary of the gender

371
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,760
and through all of this rightscon has

372
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:48,720
maintained

373
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,279
its heart i think many people see

374
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:52,880
rightscon as a home

375
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,959
or a place that they can call home and

376
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:57,120
others see others see it as a place to

377
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,160
meet the people

378
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,720
that they could only ever aspire to work

379
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:01,839
with

380
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,480
and yet others perhaps largely companies

381
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,200
and governments

382
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,600
can't wait for it to be over to please

383
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,079
stop the demands for accountability

384
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,800
and transparency and i joke on that but

385
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
i'm actually serious

386
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
because i want to send a shout out to

387
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,720
the 500 companies

388
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,600
and 55 governments who are here at

389
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,120
wright's con during this week we've

390
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,800
never seen such numbers

391
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,040
and i want to send a negative shout out

392
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,320
to those that are not here

393
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,320
but regardless of stakeholder group

394
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:34,480
collectively we are improving we're

395
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,440
evolving

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,519
and i think that wrightcon makes our

397
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:38,560
global community

398
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,519
even stronger more than anything

399
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:43,279
rightscon makes human rights

400
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,920
more likely to be enjoyed in the digital

401
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,880
age

402
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,920
and after all what better outcome

403
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,519
could we be looking for than that

404
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,720
so thanks to nikki and her amazing team

405
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,240
for what looks to be an extraordinary

406
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:58,880
and even

407
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,920

worked on rights corner over this decade

413
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,760
and finally i would like to use this

414
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,480
platform to load the accessnow team

415
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,040

416

of collaboration and solidarity that i

00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,440
have experienced

481
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
in the last 10 years working on

482
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,120
archiving and verifying human rights

483
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
documentation in syria

484
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,399
with the senior archive project at the

485
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,000
start and then globally with

486
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,199
the organization mnemonic this year

487
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,519
not only marks 10 years of rightscom but

488
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:41,759
also

489
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,360
quickly spread to many countries in the

490
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:47,920
region

491
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:50,000
and then globally in places including

492
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,920
hong kong ethiopia belarus and the

493
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,519
united states

494
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:56,000
i also left my country 10 years ago as i

495
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,759
had compulsory military service

496
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
right before the senior uprising i moved

497
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,600
to jordan where i monitored and

498
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,480
documented

499
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,720
a peaceful protests and then violence

500
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,240
against them

501
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,760
syrians were uploading and sharing

502
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,520
thousands of videos and photos they have

503
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:11,039
captured documenting

504
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,799
states violations to social media

505
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,640
platforms for the world to witness what

506
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,240
was happening

507
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,919
and this was quite different to what

508
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:19,599
happened in the 80s in syria where a

509
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,839
huge massacre was committed in hama

510
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,520
where thousands of people died without

511
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,520
much evidence about what happened

512
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,280
or who was responsible ten years ago

513
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,039
i started work as a digital security

514
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,200
trainer for human rights defenders in

515
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,760
syria

516
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,240
and other countries many of whom were

517
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,160
working to report violations to advance

518
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,280
accountability even then i was told by

519
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,880
those i was training that despite

520
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,720
mountains of content documenting

521
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,160
human rights violations published to

522
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,919
social media platforms

523
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,000
much of this vital content was being

524
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,919
taken down and disappearing potentially

525
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,000
forever

526
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,400
making matters worse massive amounts of

527
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,000
misinformation about what was really

528
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,919
going on made accurate reporting by

529
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:00,880
foreign press

530
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
ngos and accountability mechanisms who

531
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,200
were prevented from being on the ground

532
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,720
even harder

533
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,720
i recognize that documentation on social

534
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,400
media is valuable to advance

535
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,520
accountability

536
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
and also to memorize the history of our

537
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,039
country

538
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:17,120
working with two friends i founded

539
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,200
syrian archive in 2014

540
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,360
as a way to collect preserve and verify

541
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:22,240
media content

542
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,919
to fit into justice and advocacy

543
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:27,039
processes we had no financial resources

544
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,720
no technical infrastructure nor the

545
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,240
expertise on how to deal with the

546
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
largest scale of media content in

547
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:32,400
history

548
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,919
documenting human rights violations in

549
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
real time

550
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,039
and in order to work around these

551
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,120
challenges i reach out for support for

552
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:41,200
the human rights community many of whom

553
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,840
are present here today with and with

554
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,080
that support we were able to build

555
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,919
our website develop the archiving

556
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,919
software create initial workflows and

557
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:50,720
methods

558
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,679
for this operation and seven years later

559
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:55,360
starting from last year and this year we

560
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
submitted the first legal

561
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
complaints to courts in germany france

562
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,400
and sweden

563
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,080
about the use of chemical weapons

564
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,280
against civilians in syria

565
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,799
we hoped our experience with the sea

566
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,320
archive would be helpful to lawyers

567
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,360
journalists and human humanized

568
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,080
offenders

569
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,720
facing similar challenges elsewhere so

570
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:14,559
we expanded and created mnemonic to play

571
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,039
this supporting role

572
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,160
in 2018 we created the main archive in

573
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,200
2019

574
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,360
the sudanese archive always in

575
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
collaboration with and led by media

576
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,640
groups and human rights defenders from

577
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,559
those places

578
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:30,240
we continue to get requests from human

579
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,919
rights groups every week

580
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,000
last month for example my colleague in

581
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,760
sudan was having a meeting with a human

582
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,520
rights group from colombia

583
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
to share their experience in archiving

584
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,360
and verifying documentation that shows

585
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,039
that shows police violence against

586
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
civilians

587
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,559
this really shows that the issues our

588
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,919
organization faces

589
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:50,240
are far from unique a solidarity-driven

590
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,720
approach where groups share resources

591
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,760
and methodologies

592
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,360
with those facing similar issues

593
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,120
elsewhere is more vital

594
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,880
than ever before this year

595
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,559
at the 10th anniversary of ridescon a

596
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,320
large number of panels will show groups

597
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,840
working together to tackle these

598
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:06,480
challenges

599
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
develop tools and methods and better

600
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:11,360
ways to collaborate more effectively

601
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,960
my team and myself are looking forward

602
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,640
to being part of this vital discussion

603
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,320
this year and thank you so much for

604
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,280

610
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,720
has been a very traumatic decade for you

611
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:37,679
very

612
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,799
personally um and and professionally as

613
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,360
well you

614
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,240
you as you say you know you left um

615
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,600
syria

616
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,200
ten years ago um at the beginning of the

617
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:49,520
at

618
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,280
the beginning of the decade fleeing you

619
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,039
know syrian conscription and

620
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:56,320
here you are now you know leading this

621
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
extraordinary organization

622
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
and through all of that has been arab

623
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,840
spring and i wonder if you could just

624
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,480
spend a moment or two just reflecting

625
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:07,360
where we're at uh in that arc and

626
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,120
particularly at the intersection of

627
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,360
you know political uprising and digital

628
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,320
activism

629
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,840
you know what what what are you what are

630
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
you what's happening and

631
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,880
and how do we um how do we advance this

632
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,400
bend the arc towards justice

633
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:28,159
absolutely right so um

634
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,679
we've seen since 10 years a really

635
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,039
important issue

636
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,240
when the arab uprising started from

637
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,360
breaking the silence

638
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:41,280
breaking of the fear and use and using

639
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
an activist and human rights defenders

640
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,640
using what's available

641
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,600
in terms of their devices to capture

642
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,400
human rights violations on their cameras

643
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,000
and uploading

644
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,200
the documentation on social media and

645
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,360
in the case of syrian in the case of

646
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,640
other countries

647
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,520
in the region this still has been the

648
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,000
case

649
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,200
from 10 years until now

650
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,480
it didn't really matter for people

651
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,760
what is the political situation is uh

652
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,880
in terms of like improving or not

653
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,120
and when we were doing interviews with

654
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,240
people that were

655
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,280
actually capturing this content it was a

656
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,240
lot about

657
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,480
um keeping the advocacy going for the

658
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
for the things that they have asked for

659
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,520
in the beginning in terms of

660
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,799
human rights and democracy

661
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:39,760
and equality and better economical

662
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,679
situation

663
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:44,320
uh and not just only that but also a lot

664
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
of us shared about memorializing the

665
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,919
history and making sure that the future

666
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,440
generation knows

667
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
how the arab spring went and how

668
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,840
governments dealt with it

669
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,120
um and they didn't want

670
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,520
any of that to disappear as other events

671
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,400
before the

672
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,720
before the arab uprising actually also

673
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,840
disappeared

674
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,600
with very little documentation

675
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:11,360
so right now i mean what what i see

676
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,400
is i see a lot more um

677
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:17,679
collaboration and solidarity between

678
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,799
different human rights groups in the

679
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,520
region

680
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,240
working on very challenging issues uh in

681
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:24,960
a very

682
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,240
uh challenging environment

683
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,480
in an environment of impunity

684
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,919
lack of effective accountability

685
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,320
mechanisms lack of resources for civil

686
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:38,799
society at large

687
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:42,240
and from the recent of what's happening

688
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,440
in palestine

689
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:47,200
we can really see how palestinian and

690
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
regional organizations

691
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,440
are working collaboratively together to

692
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,080
tackle

693
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:55,679
challenging issues around digital rights

694
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,840
and around the censoring of palestinian

695
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,840
voices and it has been done

696
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
in a very professional way in a very

697
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,880
timely way

698
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
thank you yeah we'll talk more about

699
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,880
that um

700
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,640
later in the discussion and in

701
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,400
particular i do want to talk to you

702
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,200
about

703
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,000
or hear from you about the the purpose

704
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,919
and the need for archiving of this

705
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,440
content

706
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
because it's not just about being able

707
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,799
to see it in real time and obviously

708
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:23,919
what's happened what's happening in

709
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,120
palestine we've seen when

710
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,880
content has been removed in real time

711
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,480
and some of the consequences

712
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,600
uh the real life consequences of that

713
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:34,799
but also as you say like the

714
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:36,559
it's kind of both dispiriting and

715
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:38,480
encouraging at the same time

716
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,080
um a lot of the discussions that we're

717
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,600
having you know because i've looked back

718
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,360
over the last 10 years i looked at the

719
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,960
original comments from

720
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:47,120
from writescon back in 2011 and even

721
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,320
when access now formed back in 2009 and

722
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,039
so much of the conversation is actually

723
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:53,919
the same

724
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:56,000
you know it's about how does civil

725
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,120
society use the online sphere to be able

726
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,360
to advance their their human rights

727
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,200
agendas their political agendas

728
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,840
and who are the gatekeepers and um you

729
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
know whether it be companies or

730
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:07,679
governments and

731
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,320
how does multi-stakeholders ism fit

732
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,840
together to ensure that we actually

733
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,000
deliver human rights online

734
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,559
as was you know found to be the case

735
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:17,120
through

736
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,679
multiple human rights resolutions um so

737
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,960
thanks very much and and

738
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,039
obviously your region is also dealing

739
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:24,720
with a pandemic

740
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,120
so with that um and when you intersect

741
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,559
you know political upheaval

742
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,360
with the the crisis the health crisis i

743
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,320
think we have

744
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:35,600
um you know a very potent um and an

745
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,679
and unhappy recipe so with that let me

746
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,880
hand over to

747
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,679
uh to uh to lang to give us some

748
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:43,360
introductory remarks

749
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,080
on her area of responsibility

750
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,200
thank you thank you so much for the

751
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,080
invitation

752
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:54,559
and distinguished guests and all of the

753
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:55,520
panelists

754
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,440
um we know that technological and

755
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,960
digital developments in the health

756
00:25:58,960 --> 00:25:59,679
sector

757
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:01,840
have proven to be instrumental in the

758
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,600
promotion of the right to health

759
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:06,080
the provision of health care and in many

760
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,000
cases in many instances has direct

761
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,799
positive impact on our quality of life

762
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,880
innovation and digital interventions are

763
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,120
an integral element to ensuring new

764
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,000
capacity

765
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,799
and ability to store share and analyze

766
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,159
health information

767
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,240
at the point of care they have also

768
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,080
increased provider capabilities

769
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
and prove and improved patient access to

770
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,480
public health information

771
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,480
health provider information and

772
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,159
available services

773
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:34,000
all of which have been instrumental in

774
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,480
responding to the covert 19 pandemic

775
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:37,919
because innovation and digital

776
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:39,279
technology are going to keep

777
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,440
transforming the provision of healthcare

778
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,520
more than any other force it is

779
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:45,279
important that more investment

780
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,840
be directed towards improving innovation

781
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,679
and digital technology

782
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:52,000
universal access to healthcare services

783
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,240
is not possible without policies

784
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,159
to ensure affordable access to health

785
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:57,360
technologies

786
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,600
there are however legitimate concerns

787
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,440
about the human rights abuses

788
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,840
that digital technology can enable in

789
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,440
the area of healthcare

790
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,200
we must never forget that with any

791
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,120
endeavor to improve healthcare and the

792
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:11,039
devices used to deliver it

793
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
we are first and foremost dealing with

794
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,279
human lives we are responsible not only

795
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,200
for their immediate healthcare needs

796
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,360
but also creating opportunities and

797
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
eradicating barriers that hinder their

798
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,799
access to healthcare

799
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,960
this access is a human right which

800
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,799
intersects with other human rights

801
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:29,279
to which all people are entitled we must

802
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,520
see beyond the technology

803
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:33,039
factors that need attention to the

804
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,679
execution of equitable digital health

805
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:38,640
include accessibility and affordability

806
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,080
the digital divide

807
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,918
in much of the global south and in other

808
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
developing

809
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:57,840
racial discrimination xenophobia and

810
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,360
related intolerance

811
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:02,159
emerging digital technologies exacerbate

812
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,039
and compound

813
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:05,520
existing inequities many of which exist

814
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,559
along racial

815
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:09,200
ethnic and national origin grounds this

816
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
is a serious consideration in the light

817
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,799
of the well-established evidence for

818
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:13,520
racism

819
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
that is so deeply embedded in the global

820
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,559
healthcare system

821
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,399
in that it makes digital healthcare

822
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,880
solutions susceptible to absorbing those

823
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,080
same faults

824
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,240
digital and facial recognition in

825
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,919
technologies that are being used in

826
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,200
health innovations

827
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:30,640
may perpetuate racism and sexism ableism

828
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,720
and thereby inventing it in health

829
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,760
technology

830
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,840
in my first report a special repertoire

831
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
at the un general assembly

832
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,440
i addressed this issue head on and i

833
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,880
would like to restate

834
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,840
that within our own mission to employ

835
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:44,200
non-discrimination

836
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:46,480
anti-coloniality and intersectionality

837
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,080
in fulfillment mandate

838
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,760
we must accept that artificial

839
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,240
intelligence is not neutral

840
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
digital and artificial intelligence

841
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,240
solutions can be rules-based

842
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,520
open commercialized or authoritarian

843
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,360
and they can build on the involvement of

844
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,679
citizens communities and patients

845
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,039
or can be focused on health

846
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,760
professionals only as much as it can do

847
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,399
wonders

848
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,960
it can also cause harm and we must

849
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,799
remain vigilant and highly critical of

850
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:13,200
these

851
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
technologies while discussing the merits

852
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,679
and dangers of digital health solutions

853
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,440
our attentions must not stray from

854
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,159
policy many decisions and resolutions

855
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:23,679
can be made on this issue

856
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,840
but without strong policy support that

857
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,679
prioritizes human rights

858
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:30,159
efforts may fall short of helping anyone

859
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:32,159
and i know that many wonderful

860
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,240
society organizations whose passion for

861
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,679
human rights continue to demand

862
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:36,880
accountability

863
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
and prevent abuse through policy change

864
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,520
and remain committed to this ideal

865
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,440
and i would like to state my unwavering

866
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,120
support for this work

867
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,240
and encourage you all to do the same

868
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,080
if judicial healthcare interventions are

869
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,679
to serve us all equally

870
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:52,960
it must be approached from the

871
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
perspective that real people with

872
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,919
diverse needs

873
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,240
will be receiving its outcomes let it be

874
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,080
in a way that improves their quality of

875
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
life

876
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,120
and does not harm them there are

877
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,960
opportunities that lie ahead of us

878
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,640
if we pay attention to the work being

879
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,080
done towards building better

880
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:10,480
systems by those whose lives depend on

881
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,880
it as a global community we must achieve

882
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,600
decreasation and the democratization of

883
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,440
the global health architecture

884
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,440
anti-racism must find expression in

885
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,120
policy practice

886
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,200
resource allocation and spending

887
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,720
intersectional frameworks

888
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,880
must be the backbone of public health in

889
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,039
order to bring those in the margins

890
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:32,879
into the center thank you so much

891
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,679
uh thank you thank you very much special

892
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:38,799
effects i

893
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:42,080
very much appreciate your comments uh

894
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,080
it's really quite refreshing and i think

895
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:46,080
quite radical actually to have

896
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,840
somebody of your stature to talk about

897
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,000
these issues of racism and

898
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,559
institutional inequity in the healthcare

899
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
system

900
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,039
but i actually just before we we hand

901
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,720
over to rita i want to pick up on

902
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,080
something that you said because i i

903
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,440
don't know if the audience actually

904
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,519
heard it as closely as i did

905
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:04,880
which was you said that digital

906
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,960
technologies are going to keep

907
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,120
transforming the provision of healthcare

908
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,240
more than any other force right so

909
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,760
digital tech is going to keep is going

910
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:15,200
to transform the provision of healthcare

911
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,480
more than any other force

912
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,480
and might i just add that i think that

913
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,519
healthcare

914
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:21,360
and specifically the pandemic may have

915
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,039
actually resulted in greater digital

916
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,159
transformation

917
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,080
more than any other force as well so

918
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:28,000
there's a really interesting mutuality

919
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,360
there

920
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,080
and it's also again when we think about

921
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,519
the evolution of

922
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,600
of rightscon like you know healthcare

923
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,559
wasn't even really

924
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:38,640
on the agenda beyond patient rights i

925
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,640
would say a few years ago

926
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,320
so to have this like you know tectonic

927
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,799
impact um from health and digital and

928
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,240
digital back to health

929
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,120
um is is really quite extraordinary so

930
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:51,760
um

931
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,360
are you just trying to you're just

932
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:55,279
talking to a technically savvy audience

933
00:31:55,279 --> 00:31:56,880
and giving us that piece of information

934
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,480
or do you actually think that that is

935
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,240
the fact that you know that

936
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,240
the digital is going to impact

937
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,480
healthcare more than any other force i'd

938
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,880
love to hear your response to that

939
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:09,360
yeah it's very important and i really

940
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,200
believe that truly and i

941
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,799
i must state that as much as i'm the

942
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,320
special repertoire i'm still a medical

943
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,919
doctor in clinical practice

944
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,600
um and i had to remember to just take

945
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,440
off my stethoscope just before joining

946
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,320
this call

947
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,399
um because as it is i do have patients

948
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,399
who are consulting with me virtually

949
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:27,039
and before the pandemic the policy in

950
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:28,080
south africa was very

951
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,679
restrictive in terms of tele health and

952
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:32,000
teleconsultation

953
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,559
and tele medicine in general and we've

954
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,440
seen with the

955
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,760
pandemic how those policies have been

956
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,480
relaxed

957
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
to enable more access for patients not

958
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,519
just only information but to accessing

959
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,679
practitioners themselves and i think

960
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,679
those are the types of

961
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:50,000
forces i'm talking about right is a

962
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:50,960
technology

963
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,279
even in the time of a pandemic the worst

964
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,799
global disaster

965
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:56,880
it's what has kept me closer to my

966
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,279
patients and my patients closer to me

967
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,880
and those are the types of policy

968
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,799
developments that we need to keep

969
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:05,120
and keep asking ourselves why why did we

970
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,960
have these very limiting

971
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,279
policies in the first place the other

972
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:10,080
important thing

973
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,840
when you think about the right to health

974
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,840
right sexual and productive health

975
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:15,679
rights srhr in short

976
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:17,600
is an integral element of the right to

977
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,000
health and globally we've seen how women

978
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,919
have been able to access

979
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:23,760
abortion tablets and medication

980
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,919
information purely because of what

981
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:28,000
technology has been able to provide for

982
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:28,480
them

983
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,559
so it's definitely a force it's a

984
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:31,760
positive force

985
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,120
we just have to be away and intentional

986
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,840
about

987
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,039
eliminating existing um issues of

988
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,039
vulnerability and marginalization within

989
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:43,919
technology itself

990
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,760
thank you and your comments about you

991
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,679
know artificial intelligence

992
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:50,320
not being neutral and us having to

993
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,519
investigate

994
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,760
the you know inherent bias for instance

995
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:56,000
in the data sets that informs the

996
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,120
algorithm uh which of course is rolling

997
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,559
out in the provision of healthcare

998
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:02,159
and incidentally i think the stethoscope

999
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,200
would have been a welcome addition to

1000
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,079
to the conversation um certainly if i

1001
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,359
was a doctor i'd be wearing it all the

1002
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:10,159
time

1003
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,159
uh so let's head let's hand over to um

1004
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:17,199
to our next speaker rita um rita

1005
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:20,159
um please having heard the comments from

1006
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,599
hardy

1007
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:23,839
with respect to you know what it's like

1008
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,520
to be a user and not have

1009
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,719
vision into the tech sector and seeing

1010
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,800
decisions being made

1011
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,480
outcomes being delivered without

1012
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:34,719
actually having you know access or entry

1013
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:36,639
points into the big tech companies or

1014
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:37,359
the

1015
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:40,159
the isps or the telcos and please let us

1016
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:40,560
uh

1017
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:43,199
into the insight into the the sort of

1018
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,480
the backend of

1019
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:47,280
of being a telecom and particularly in a

1020
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,480
marginalized market

1021
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:52,000
and thanks the floor is yours thank you

1022
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,040
and let me just start by saying that i

1023
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,159
believe

1024
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:58,720
the rights conference this year is more

1025
00:34:58,720 --> 00:35:00,480
relevant than ever

1026
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,920
after more than one year where

1027
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,839
technology and digital access have been

1028
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:04,720
so vital

1029
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:07,440
to societies all over the world so so

1030
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,200
this is really

1031
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,280
an important days when used responsibly

1032
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,680
mobile technology can be a powerful tool

1033
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,520
to promote human rights and enable

1034
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,520
sustainable development

1035
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,880
however i must say that

1036
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,040
telecommunication companies also face

1037
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,119
human right challenges wherever

1038
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:30,160
we operate for instance while the duty

1039
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,520
to protect human rights

1040
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,280
such as private privacy and freedom of

1041
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,359
expression rest with the authorities

1042
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:38,400
we must not acknowledge that the

1043
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,520
challenges that may

1044
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,760
arise of authorities excessively using

1045
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,280
their powers and we've been

1046
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,240
touching upon it already today let me

1047
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,240
give a couple of examples

1048
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:50,720
telenor may receive censorship requests

1049
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,640
to block access to a website in our

1050
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,079
market

1051
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,920
while blocking sites containing child

1052
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,280
sexual abuse material

1053
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,800
helps that as a serious criminal

1054
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,280
activity request to block political

1055
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,880
content for example

1056
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,520
present challenges another type of

1057
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,280
request we may get from the authorities

1058
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,359
is to shut down the network

1059
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,920
telenor seeks to avoid down of its

1060
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,359
network and believe that it's

1061
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:14,960
in the best interest of the customers to

1062
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,680
minimize disruption of services

1063
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,560
however in extraordinary circumstances a

1064
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,680
government

1065
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,240
may require a limited network shutdown

1066
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,480
to protect its citizens from terrorism

1067
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,040
or other

1068
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,720
serious safety or security threats

1069
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,440
as a telecom operator it's our duty to

1070
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:34,880
respect human rights

1071
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:36,480
including privacy and freedom of

1072
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,640
expression it is therefore important

1073
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:39,520
that we have

1074
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,599
policies and processes in place to

1075
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,440
address risks to human rights

1076
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,000
and that these policies are anchored at

1077
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,000
the top

1078
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,400
and it's also important that we engage

1079
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,599
in dialogue with

1080
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:54,960
stakeholders to discuss these challenges

1081
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,160
and to share and learn we work to engage

1082
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,920
with stakeholders bilaterally

1083
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,599
and through local and international

1084
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:03,760
platforms including the global network

1085
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,040
initiative

1086
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
to share information and identify

1087
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,160
potential positive

1088
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:10,640
or negative impacts of our operations

1089
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,960
this engagement helps us shape advance

1090
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:15,359
and implement our human rights efforts

1091
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:16,960
and what it has taught us

1092
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,960
through our journey is that we need this

1093
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,079
collaboration

1094
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:23,680
to continuously keep improving

1095
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,119
to uphold the human rights principles

1096
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:29,040
companies also need to be transparent

1097
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:30,640
about the challenges and company

1098
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:33,680
practices to the extent possible

1099
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:35,839
there are regular reporting processes

1100
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,760
that many companies have adopted

1101
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,599
including annual sustainability

1102
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,280
reporting

1103
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,680
many tech companies including us also

1104
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,839
publish annual disclosure reports

1105
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,680
which report on the number of authority

1106
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,480
requests the company receives

1107
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,200
we have also learned in telenor that

1108
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:55,680
transparency is sometimes the only tool

1109
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:57,599
we have for mitigating human rights

1110
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:00,000
impacts in very difficult situations

1111
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,000
due to for instance legal or licensed

1112
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,359
obligations

1113
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:05,280
or due to the security of our staff on

1114
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,760
the ground in challenging markets

1115
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,000
transparency can be a powerful tool

1116
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,920
as it helps us to create awareness

1117
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,440
around the situation

1118
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,440
including in context where information

1119
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:20,000
may be restricted or limited

1120
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,880
it can also support advocacy efforts

1121
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,880
either on behalf of the company or other

1122
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,280
stakeholders including civil society or

1123
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:28,720
governments

1124
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,560
transparency is also key in ensuring

1125
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:31,760
accountability

1126
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,320
for telenor but also for other groups

1127
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,119
just to conclude for now although i

1128
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,640
believe that telenor has made a lot of

1129
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,400
progress over the years in addressing

1130
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:43,599
human rights challenges

1131
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:46,240
we still have a long way to go and with

1132
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,240
constant development in our markets in

1133
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,119
technology

1134
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,440
and in the geopolitical world we live in

1135
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,160
we see this

1136
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
as a continuous journey and a journey

1137
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,400
that we cannot take alone

1138
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,480
so i look forward to our continuous

1139
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,560
discussion on this topic today and in

1140
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:03,440
the days to come

1141
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
thank you rita um thanks so much for

1142
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:09,040
that um there's a reason why we invited

1143
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,599
you

1144
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:13,280
into the opening ceremony and as i said

1145
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:13,599
there's

1146
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:15,920
you know 500 companies here and one of

1147
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,599
the reasons is well the main reason is

1148
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:18,240
because

1149
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:21,280
we um

1150
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:24,880
you know we're looking for best practice

1151
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,880
essentially uh we're looking for how

1152
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,400
companies should navigate

1153
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,440
these very difficult environments uh

1154
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,880
and we um

1155
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:37,119
and there isn't that much best practice

1156
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,400
to be honest you know it's

1157
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,320
very it's very challenging and it's very

1158
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,680
challenging for the tech companies as

1159
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:43,040
well and we understand that

1160
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:44,720
i think it's important for us to see

1161
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,480
that there's actually a human behind the

1162
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,280
logo

1163
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,960
you know that there's actually decisions

1164
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:50,320
that are being made

1165
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,760
because we actually often just see

1166
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,839
something that's delivered as opposed to

1167
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,480
the kind of nuance that happens uh

1168
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:59,760
on on the back end but maybe you can

1169
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,280
give us a sense as i mentioned

1170
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,880
you and you mentioned you've been that

1171
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,720
you're one of the the four tail comms in

1172
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:07,200
in myanmar what what happens when the

1173
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,400
phone rings

1174
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,760
um and you know you're in oslo i assume

1175
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:15,040
uh and and or nearby and um you know

1176
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:16,800
across the other side of the world

1177
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,200
uh there is a coup that's happened

1178
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,560
what's some of the inter

1179
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,560
internalities that happen um and um

1180
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,560
and i'm particularly interested in

1181
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,480
the kind of the the conflict between the

1182
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,359
upholding of

1183
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:36,839
international law and also

1184
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:39,680
um principles and norms

1185
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,200
within norway and and and and then the

1186
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,400
application of that

1187
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,839
in another market with domestic law

1188
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:49,760
which isn't necessarily democratically

1189
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,880
informed

1190
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:53,280
give us a sense of like what goes on

1191
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,040
within the company and how you actually

1192
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:57,040
deliver the decisions

1193
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,280
say for instance on something like shut

1194
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:02,240
down the internet now

1195
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,520
yes and as you can imagine it has been

1196
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,400
challenging months since uh the coup

1197
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,040
occurred in

1198
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
in the first of february our first

1199
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:13,520
thought of course when this happened

1200
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,319
was uh the difficult situation disgraced

1201
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,800
for the people in myanmar

1202
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
but as many um other multinational

1203
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,480
companies

1204
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,760
um operating in myanmar we had to

1205
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,560
mobilize

1206
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,000
a multifunctional team to support

1207
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,839
and handle this highly irregular

1208
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:34,079
situation uh

1209
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:37,119
and and at not least support our local

1210
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:37,839
management

1211
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:41,440
um on the ground and

1212
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,240
i must admit that we have been facing a

1213
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,119
reality

1214
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:46,880
uh where we had to balance our

1215
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,480
principles of

1216
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,200
transparency with the safety of our

1217
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:53,520
employees in the country

1218
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
and on the basis of this this we

1219
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,119
from the early start had three

1220
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,640
priorities

1221
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,680
the first one uh was the safety and

1222
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,560
security

1223
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:08,000
of our employees in myanmar the second

1224
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:08,560
one

1225
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:11,040
was keeping the network operational and

1226
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,119
accessible for customers

1227
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,400
and uh

1228
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,880
to the authorities that access to

1229
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,839
telecom

1230
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:22,240
services should be maintained at all

1231
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,520
times

1232
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,680
and the third has been to be as

1233
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,280
transparent to the extent

1234
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,640
possible but as many of you are aware of

1235
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,520
the situation has been difficult and we

1236
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,599
are continuously seeking advice and

1237
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:36,720
support

1238
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,440
from several experts and entities

1239
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,040
including the un

1240
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,599
and local and international civil

1241
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:44,560
society

1242
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,880
and other peer companies companies to

1243
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:48,160
navigate in this

1244
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,200
challenging situation and

1245
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,160
we are constantly addressing this and

1246
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,520
doing what we can

1247
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:58,640
to uphold good services in a difficult

1248
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,200
situation

1249
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:04,240
i can imagine and and um well i can only

1250
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:05,359
imagine i think

1251
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:07,920
one of the we've been talking about

1252
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:09,520
internal best practice within the

1253
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,040
companies for a long time

1254
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:12,720
all the way back since you know rights

1255
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:15,839
con in silicon valley back in 2011.

1256
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,920
um you know we've been pushing for

1257
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,160
example even just now for facebook to

1258
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,760
have a human rights

1259
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,200
uh officer uh on the board um because we

1260
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,040
believe that it's not just a question of

1261
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,359
the transactional nature of dealing with

1262
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:32,000
you know the the shutdown or the request

1263
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,880
for

1264
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,920
user data but it's also the policy

1265
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,359
that's set from the top and also the

1266
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:39,200
policy that's set by the investors as

1267
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,800
well

1268
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,040
heidi let me bring you back in to like

1269
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,880
get a better sense from you

1270
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,599
as to like if we look at like what's

1271
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:49,520
happened for example in palestine just

1272
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,200
now but also in in

1273
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,240
other countries like colombia the

1274
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,119
response was

1275
00:43:55,119 --> 00:43:56,880
you know there's been a technical glitch

1276
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:59,680
or um you know there was a sort of some

1277
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:00,800
sort of

1278
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:04,000
policy issue that overtook um

1279
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,720
the kind of human rights decision it's

1280
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:08,640
not clear to us what's actually happened

1281
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,920
in some of these countries in terms of

1282
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:10,400
like

1283
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,560
you know content being removed um live

1284
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,920
stream being stopped

1285
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:17,760
um being deleted um you know is there

1286
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:19,520
is there a technical glitch going on or

1287
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:21,200
is there a human rights glitch

1288
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:24,319
um and and how do you you know how do

1289
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:25,280
you having heard

1290
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:27,359
readers speak like what's some of the

1291
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:28,880
recommendations or some of the things

1292
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,319
that you're asking for from the tech

1293
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:32,240
sector in 2021

1294
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:36,960
um and so this is something that

1295
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:39,839
definitely we have been seeing i mean

1296
00:44:39,839 --> 00:44:40,480
starting

1297
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:44,079
from 10 years ago the issues when it

1298
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:44,630
comes to

1299
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,319
[Music]

1300
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,280
takedowns and the problems what we are

1301
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:51,760
facing with content moderation

1302
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,599
so it's nothing new i think what we are

1303
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,280
seeing right now it's just like it's

1304
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:56,960
it's huge in scale

1305
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:00,400
and that's nearly normal because

1306
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:03,280
10 years documentation human rights

1307
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,240
violations more

1308
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,720
getting online and more being vitally

1309
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,640
shared on social media platforms

1310
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:10,560
uh because this is what the human rights

1311
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:12,480
defenders mission is to make sure

1312
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,040
others witness what's happening and then

1313
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,079
uh

1314
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,839
make sure that they they get the support

1315
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,280
that they need for accountability

1316
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,440
advocacy justice and so on

1317
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
uh and we have seen a huge peak in syria

1318
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:24,960
when

1319
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:28,079
when it comes to content takedowns uh

1320
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:30,640
because we were monitoring uh most of

1321
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,160
the account that they were publishing

1322
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,040
this content

1323
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:37,280
on social media so over 5000 accounts

1324
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,040
and we tracked down hundreds of

1325
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,720
thousands of videos that were

1326
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,599
that were removed right now what we see

1327
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,440
in palestine

1328
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,240
is exactly what we have seen in syria in

1329
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,040
terms of

1330
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,240
the scale of media that has been

1331
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,000
terminated and what we have got in terms

1332
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,200
of

1333
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:01,200
the answer from the tech companies it

1334
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,800
was a technical error it's exactly

1335
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,800
what's happening right now in palestine

1336
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,040
uh that it was a technical error but

1337
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,800
i mean the situation is is definitely

1338
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:15,760
more clear to us in terms of the

1339
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,280
systematic approach

1340
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:20,000
into content takedowns the systematic

1341
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:21,119
approach into

1342
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:25,040
not really investing as much

1343
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,280
to make sure that companies are

1344
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,160
respecting

1345
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,680
human rights issues around the world are

1346
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:36,079
investing in resources when it comes to

1347
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:39,200
content moderation as well

1348
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,520
right now what's happening is that civil

1349
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:43,599
society organizations are collaborating

1350
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:45,760
more effectively to track down

1351
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,079
incidents of content takedowns

1352
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:53,440
and make sure that we have very clear

1353
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:56,720
cases and research around it making sure

1354
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,160
that we have very clear statistics

1355
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,440
around it so we can provide it to

1356
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:02,640
companies as evidence

1357
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,440
because just to counter the argument of

1358
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,880
a technical error or extremism content

1359
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:12,319
and we have that in place but

1360
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,200
what we've been asking for uh is

1361
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,280
definitely we've been asking for

1362
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,079
uh opening investigations into those

1363
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,599
cases that

1364
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:23,760
civil society organizations have

1365
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
collected whether in palestine syria

1366
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,920
colombia

1367
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:30,079
and many other countries that are also

1368
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:31,200
facing similar

1369
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:34,000
challenges but unfortunately content is

1370
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:34,960
not being

1371
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,280
an incident not being as documented as

1372
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,040
clearly as possible and definitely to

1373
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:39,839
immediately

1374
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,559
reinstate all those accounts and content

1375
00:47:42,559 --> 00:47:44,319
and provide transparency around

1376
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:46,480
the decision-making processes why did

1377
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:47,920
they take those accounts down

1378
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:52,800
and this is what we have been asking for

1379
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,880
thank you yeah i mean i think one of the

1380
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:55,920
issues that we keep

1381
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:57,680
hearing certainly in this panel but i

1382
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:59,280
hope it doesn't end

1383
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,280
um at the word transparency because you

1384
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:03,119
know i often feel like transparency is

1385
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,200
it's absolutely essential for sure but

1386
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,520
it's also only part of the story

1387
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:09,520
it does enable accountability but what

1388
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,040
we're looking for is actually

1389
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,880
not transparency into human rights

1390
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:14,559
violations we're actually looking

1391
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,040
for an end or a stopping of those

1392
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,599
violations before they occur

1393
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:22,000
so and there's many pieces to that of

1394
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,440
course particularly when we start to

1395
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,599
think about more complex issues

1396
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:28,319
that have entered into our gender from

1397
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:28,960
you know

1398
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,800
the algorithm to biometric surveillance

1399
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,359
and just the way in which technology has

1400
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:36,160
essentially

1401
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:38,400
impacted all ev all in every parts of

1402
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,280
our lives

1403
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,440
um you know the issue of transparency

1404
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,599
yes like lots of green ticks to that

1405
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:45,520
but we need much more than that so with

1406
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,280
that let me ask you

1407
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,640
um um when you

1408
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:53,920
um when

1409
00:48:53,920 --> 00:48:56,480
uh decisions are being made around

1410
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:58,000
health and the provision of healthcare

1411
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,200
in the context of

1412
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:02,960
the pandemic and digital technologies um

1413
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,839
you know we we i think we're we're still

1414
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:06,880
in a sort of norms

1415
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:08,559
we're very much at the early stages of a

1416
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,160
norm setting period

1417
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:13,200
and i'm trying to understand um

1418
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,200
you know obviously we've seen it in the

1419
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:16,400
sort of the areas that

1420
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,319
that hardy and also that rita are

1421
00:49:18,319 --> 00:49:20,000
talking about but in healthcare it's new

1422
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:22,319
where where does where are these norms

1423
00:49:22,319 --> 00:49:23,440
being set

1424
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,839
uh is it you know is it at the world

1425
00:49:25,839 --> 00:49:27,280
health organization

1426
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,839
um is it within national governments is

1427
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:31,599
it within big pharma

1428
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:33,920
uh how do we how are we going to ensure

1429
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,000
that the norms around

1430
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,480
you know this sort of massive shift to

1431
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,520
health care

1432
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:44,559
um are actually rights respecting

1433
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,040
great question i think um there's a lot

1434
00:49:47,040 --> 00:49:48,720
to be said i think about

1435
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,000
having local solutions right and having

1436
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:53,040
people on the

1437
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,240
on the um client facing all rights hold

1438
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:58,480
their face inside of things to ever sit

1439
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,000
at the table i think some of the most

1440
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,440
frustrating

1441
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,240
spaces i've ever been is where you have

1442
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,400
policy makers you have people who are in

1443
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,400
research and developers

1444
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:11,200
and you never find the clinicians or the

1445
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,400
service providers

1446
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:14,960
on those tables and i think this is such

1447
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:15,599
a time

1448
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:18,480
where regardless of what the policy was

1449
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:18,960
you know

1450
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:21,280
and i gave it that example earlier we

1451
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:23,359
had to make things work as clinicians on

1452
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,720
the ground because we have

1453
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,520
lives to save and so you will find that

1454
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,040
in some instances

1455
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:32,400
the countries or the regional framework

1456
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,079
is very restrictive and sometimes

1457
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:36,160
criminalizing of certain people

1458
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:38,000
but you have clinicians and providers

1459
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:40,240
who understand human rights and are able

1460
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:42,559
to protect and promote human rights

1461
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:44,720
in how they practice um their you know

1462
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,960
medicine and in their clinical practice

1463
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,880
the other element is that of course

1464
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:50,720
national regulations um

1465
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:53,119
are important because there are country

1466
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,400
or geographical

1467
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,200
um specific issues and needs you also

1468
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,760
have the who which i think for me did a

1469
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,000
great thing in terms of developing the

1470
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,760
self-care guide for example in srhr that

1471
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:08,480
became particularly useful for this time

1472
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:11,520
you then also have of course the

1473
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,920
the health professional bodies which

1474
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:15,200
have a mandate

1475
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,000
to regulate the the health professionals

1476
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,319
and how they treat patients and ethics

1477
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:20,559
of

1478
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,359
care and and i would say unfortunately

1479
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:25,119
even with undergraduate and postgraduate

1480
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:26,319
medical training

1481
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,760
there is still a lack of a human

1482
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,760
rights-based approach to clinical

1483
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:31,920
uh training undergrad and postgrad so

1484
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,520
there's something to be said there

1485
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:36,559
that we already finding a leg and so if

1486
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:37,280
you're going to add

1487
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,079
technology and digital rights onto it

1488
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:40,720
you know that

1489
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:42,400
i don't think that the foundation is

1490
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,640
solid i think there's a lot to be said

1491
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:47,040
about continued professional development

1492
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:47,920
in in

1493
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:50,000
in a healthcare setting where it's right

1494
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,200
based um

1495
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,720
and it's not only something that's

1496
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:55,200
spoken about at the development or the

1497
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,880
design level it must be

1498
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,040
everything everyone involved in all the

1499
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:01,359
way through the stacks

1500
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:04,400
yeah yeah absolutely well thank you so

1501
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:04,880
much and

1502
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,760
i'm gonna have to draw this um this

1503
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:10,319
panel to a close just because of

1504
00:52:10,319 --> 00:52:12,559
the the restrictions on time the good

1505
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:14,079
news is that we've got

1506
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:16,319
five over 500 sessions they're going to

1507
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,200
drill down

1508
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,520
into each of the items that we've

1509
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,480
touched on

1510
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:24,079
i think just seeing these issues around

1511
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:26,079
the fact that so much has happened over

1512
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:27,280
these 10 years and yet

1513
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:30,160
so much is still the same even with

1514
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:32,000
these new developments that are taking

1515
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,520
place i think many of the principles are

1516
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:35,119
the same um

1517
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:37,040
and in fact you know as an organization

1518
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,880
and as a platform we talk about

1519
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:40,480
the universality of human rights

1520
00:52:40,480 --> 00:52:42,640
regardless of whether it's in healthcare

1521
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:43,680
or whether it's in

1522
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,839
democracy or whether it's in education

1523
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:47,359
or whether it's the provision of water

1524
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:47,760
that

1525
00:52:47,760 --> 00:52:49,520
human rights should form the basis of

1526
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,040
all of those

1527
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,160
discussions and all of those debates and

1528
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,160
and actually sit at the very center

1529
00:52:56,160 --> 00:52:57,760
i think we're also looking at issues

1530
00:52:57,760 --> 00:52:59,680
around new norms

1531
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,800
as we tackle many of these issues

1532
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,559
the the benefits and also the

1533
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,000
limitations on

1534
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,240
transparency is a matter that we will

1535
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,040
discuss

1536
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,040
and throughout the week and also of

1537
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,119
course the role of the tech sector

1538
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,599
the fact that it has done so much in

1539
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:17,440
terms of the delivery and the enabling

1540
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,599
of rights and yet at the same time

1541
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:21,839
is causing so many problems i think we

1542
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:23,760
have a human rights crisis that is

1543
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,800
unfurling

1544
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,119
uh within the texts within the tech

1545
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:28,720
sector and on tech platforms

1546
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,160
that needs to be addressed it's no

1547
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:32,480
longer business as usual that is okay

1548
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,400
and to come back i think finally just to

1549
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,760
close off on hardy's point which is

1550
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,400
about

1551
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,960
collaboration and around participation

1552
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,800
and i think you all mentioned that

1553
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,559
that we need to actually work across

1554
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,240
stakeholder groups which is exactly the

1555
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:46,480
purpose of rightscon

1556
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,280
so you know it's a place in which to

1557
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:50,000
meet

1558
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,680
people that you would never otherwise

1559
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:53,920
meet to be able to get different

1560
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,440
understandings to be able to better do

1561
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:56,400
your work

1562
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:58,319
and also to form those relationships so

1563
00:53:58,319 --> 00:54:00,079
that they go beyond the five days of

1564
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:02,079
rights kind and hopefully

1565
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:04,559
evolve into meaningful relationships and

1566
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,160
partnerships going forward

1567
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,920
so with that thank you very much for

1568
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,240
your time very much appreciated and i

1569
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,359
will hand over

1570
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:13,760
to daphne to talk a little bit about

1571
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,119
writescon for a couple of minutes and

1572
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:16,079

1573
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,319
with harvey and melody and we can begin

1574
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:19,520

1596
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:58,880

to take a look

1602
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,040

1603
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,640
slides to show you

1604
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:15,280
just a few helpful tips um in the guide

1605
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:16,880
you'll find information on how to set up

1606
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:17,760
your profile

1607
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,319
how to share details about yourself how

1608
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,920
to set up your time zone so you can

1609
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,160
navigate the program in your local time

1610
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:26,480
um you know like brett mentioned with

1611
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,480
over 500 sessions to choose from over

1612
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,599
the course of the week

1613
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:30,960
the guide also shows you how you can

1614
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,640
plan ahead and you can do that by

1615
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,079
indicating your interest for those

1616
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:35,520
sessions that you'd like to attend and

1617
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:37,839
build your own personal schedule

1618
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,400
um in the next slide i'll show how you

1619
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:41,440
can set up your

1620
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,920
your calendar reminders how to set up

1621
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,599
calendar reminders and include them into

1622
00:55:45,599 --> 00:55:47,680
your own personal schedule

1623
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:50,720
so this is a great helpful tip because

1624
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,680
you want to make sure that you don't

1625
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,760
miss out on those sessions so

1626
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,440
there's also information about the many

1627
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,880
ways that you can engage with other

1628
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,480
participants throughout the week

1629
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,880
i will have discussion forums one-on-one

1630
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:02,799
chats and group chat functions that are

1631
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:06,079
available starting today um in the next

1632
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:06,559
slide

1633
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:08,480
i i just wanted to show and highlight

1634
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:10,000
the type of session formats that we're

1635
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,200
hosting

1636
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,319
we'll have sessions that are

1637
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:14,319
pre-recorded and will be available at

1638
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:15,680
all times

1639
00:56:15,680 --> 00:56:18,240
like lightning talks and tech demos will

1640
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,240
have sessions with unlimited capacity

1641
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,280
like panels and fireside chats and

1642
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,200
because of the interactive interactive

1643
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,799
nature of community labs

1644
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,559
in strategy sessions i just wanted to

1645
00:56:28,559 --> 00:56:30,400
note that those will have limited

1646
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:32,240
capacity and they will close when they

1647
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:32,960
reach their

1648
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,599
the attendance gaps but if you aren't

1649
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:37,280
able to make it into your first session

1650
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:37,839
of choice

1651
00:56:37,839 --> 00:56:39,440
not to worry because there will always

1652
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:41,359
be programming available at all times

1653
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:42,960
and many other opportunities for

1654
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,839
engagement

1655
00:56:45,839 --> 00:56:47,920
if we could yeah the last thing on the

1656
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,760
program here that i wanted to mention

1657
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,799
is our open spaces which is a new format

1658
00:56:52,799 --> 00:56:54,240
designed for fun and creative

1659
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:55,599
programming

1660
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:57,520
we'll have live performances film

1661
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,000

1663
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,079
sign for everyone to connect relax and

1664
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:06,240
unwind so we hope you will take a moment

1665
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:06,559
to

1666
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:10,319
tune in and enjoy those sessions

1667
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:12,720
in the next slide um you'll see our

1668
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,240
different channels for contacting

1669
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:15,200
support

1670
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,440
um and you know as you explore the the

1671
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,720
platform you get familiar with the

1672
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:20,240
platform we really want to make sure

1673
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:20,720
that

1674
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:22,640
everyone feels supported every step of

1675
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:23,839
the way um

1676
00:57:23,839 --> 00:57:26,640
so in the platform you'll see a section

1677
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:27,680
for the help desk

1678
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,599
that includes information and emails to

1679
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:32,079
reach out to for any general questions

1680
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,079
about your participation or any safety

1681
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:36,000
and security concerns

1682
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,240
you also find more details about our

1683
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:40,160
approach to keeping rightscon a safe

1684
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,480
productive and inclusive space

1685
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,400
and on this note i just wanted to take a

1686
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:46,319
moment to remind everyone that rightscon

1687
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:47,760
is governed by our court of conduct

1688
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:48,799
policies

1689
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,559
and these policies are set in place to

1690
00:57:50,559 --> 00:57:53,040
create a safe a safe space one that is

1691
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,760

1721
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:55,440
experience for me in terms of decision

1722
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:56,720
making

1723
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:59,280
and also making sure that um you know

exciting part that i'm

intended to explore in terms of

1735

technology in these years is how i could

1736
