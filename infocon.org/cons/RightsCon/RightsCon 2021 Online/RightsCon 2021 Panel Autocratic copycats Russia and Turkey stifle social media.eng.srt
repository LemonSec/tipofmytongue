and we will be discussing the increasing

41
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,920
desire of turkey and russia to control

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,000
social media

43
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,479
this is uh interesting because

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,479
people who follow both countries notice

45
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:04,560
that things kind of happen around the

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,479
same time you know when this is not only

47
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,878
social media whatever the topic is

48
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,399
you know if uh

49
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:11,840
if

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,959
it's anti-lgbt something then one the

51
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
the rest one will follow the next week

52
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
or the next month so this is very

53
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
interesting and of course this is the

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
general trend and uh but before we start

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,200
we have a very short poll on uh how the

56
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,959
audience uses social media and how

57
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,040
important it is so if you could uh

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,879
quickly answer the questions

59
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,160
um just to you know uh uh remind us all

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,680
of the fact that it is very important

61
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,000
for for any person not just for

62
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,400
journalists or activists and

63
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
uh

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
just to you know

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,120
um

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,239
just to really understand what

67
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:47,920
restricting social media might mean for

68
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,519
the average person

69
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:52,000
and i can't see your answers yet but i

70
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,319
can say my uh i'm just going to share my

71
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,959
usage overview so uh

72
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,640
from my phone

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:01,440
so today and today it's only 2 pm 2 pm

74
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,400
here in turkey i've used uh my phone for

75
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,159
five hours and i've used uh

76
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,640
what's up and reddit's so social media

77
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
uh for about two and a half hours of

78
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,680
that so that's not very healthy

79
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,280
but

80
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,959
um

81
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:21,200
but the um i can't see the questions but

82
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,640
i'm going to be um

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
so this you know comparing to the global

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
average uh i don't have any social media

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,159
statistics on turkey and russia but the

86
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,599
according to the digital 2020 survey and

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,480
russians and and turkish people use uh

88
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,680
the internet overall uh for seven hours

89
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,879
a day

90
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,400
however uh

91
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,640
again not knowing the social media uh

92
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,159
statistics oh wait a minute just the

93
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,040
screen your your responses also came in

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
but i can't see them

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,239
um

96
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,760
but however

97
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,439
i'll get back to your results soon

98
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,439
some

99
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,360
statistics from the tweak the turkish

100
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,439
statistics agencies say that the average

101
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,920
person in turkey still spends about six

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,239
hours watching tv and they also say that

103
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,560
you know they get most of their uh news

104
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,760
from

105
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,680
from television and in the case of

106
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,360
russia you know where there's uh again

107
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,519
this uh ongoing hostility against these

108
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,358
big tech companies especially from uh

109
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,600
from international uh

110
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,639
agencies the the the most uh widely used

111
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,600
um

112
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,840
statistics

113
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,759
uh the most widely used social media are

114
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,440
actually contacted

115
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,320
which are

116
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,320
um which are not international companies

117
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
so uh there's uh it's i think i find

118
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,720
this interesting because you know russia

119
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,000
and turkey have been very concerned

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,080
about what people say on social media

121
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,840
how they use it but it's

122
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,759
it's not very certain that people

123
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,120
uh

124
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,600
actually you know use them to i don't

125
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,360
know

126
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
overthrow the governments or something

127
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,400
so it's very interesting and also you

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,400
know both of these countries have uh

129
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,759
um many prisoners in uh jail two kabot

130
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,360
countries have uh jailed their

131
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,000
opposition leaders despite very uh

132
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,880
strong european court of human rights uh

133
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,320
decisions in the case of salatin

134
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,720
dimitash and alexey nawani for example

135
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,160
and the right to protest is almost

136
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,759
non-existent

137
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,320
and do they everything is pretty much

138
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,320
under control you know looking from from

139
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,160
this view but why are they uh still

140
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,240
regulating

141
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,080
social media this much because you know

142
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,160
uh access

143
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,000
bands and blockings are common do they

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,440
really need this so today we will be

145
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,160
answering uh these questions

146
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
uh

147
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,039
we'll be trying to answer these

148
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,759
questions uh together and we will also

149
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,280
be looking forward for your input

150
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,759

on these issues which was uh which is a

174
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,720
very good read as well but uh so they

clients are uh journalists who are

183
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,599
actually affected by these uh bans and

184
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
prisons uh

185
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
imprisonments and whatnot so first i

186
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,000
would like to uh start with idina

187
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,479
and if irena so what is the situation

188
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
with the social media regulation in

189
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,759
russia right now how how are they

190
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,800
approaching

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
you know big tech and companies what is

192
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,039
what are their concerns

193
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,800
uh

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,080
you know in russia uh there are so much

195
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,199
legislation uh restrictive legislation

196
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,599
on social media and on traditional media

197
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,319
was adopted for the last few years that

198
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
even for me a person who are involved in

199
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,520
all these issues even for me it's very

200
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,840
difficult to understand what is allowed

201
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,440
and what is prohibited because uh

202
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,560
everything

203
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,639
literally everything that concerns

204
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:45,520
politics or important matters can be

205
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,280
considered as

206
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,840
future posted on your social media as a

207
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,319
journalist or as an individuals can be

208
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,400
considered extremism

209
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,360
or disrespect to the authorities or

210
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,720
calls for

211
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
uh participation or calls for

212
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,280
participation in public disorders with

213
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,440
in reality means uh

214
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,840
peaceful demonstrations and so far and

215
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,280
so on so

216
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,680
uh to operate on your social media as

217
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,560
journalists and as an individuals it's

218
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,000
very very difficult today

219
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,280
the latest you ask me about the latest

220
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:24,000
developments the latest developments uh

221
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,560
in this direction i can i can i can i

222
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,120
can't uh give you the full picture of

223
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,120
all legislations of russia because it

224
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,519
takes me like five hours maybe ten hour

225
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,799
hours but the latest development was the

226
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:39,440
social media self-regulation law

227
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,240
this law obliges the social media to

228
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:45,760
monitor pro preemptively the whole

229
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:49,200
contact on say facebook twitter adna

230
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,640
classic here

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,440
and to shut down

232
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,600
all the contents that can be considered

233
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:58,720
as illegal i told that illegal content

234
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,120
according to the russian legislation may

235
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
be anything from uh from real really

236
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,560
illegal content like uh information on

237
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,480
drugs or child

238
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,480
porno to

239
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,040
any kind of critique of to the

240
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,200
authorities and uh

241
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,360
any kind of

242
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,959
any information about peaceful

243
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,320
demonstrations uh or even even just even

244
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,800
just some kind of radical opinion on any

245
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,440
issues my favorite my favorite examples

246
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,720
of uh

247
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:32,000
crazy uh of crazy implementation of all

248
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,279
this law uh happened few years ago a man

249
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,399
was sent to prison for posting on his on

250
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,320
his facebook uh

251
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,360
a

252
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,040
picture of

253
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,640
of toothpaste

254
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,440
with kept in caption

255
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,720
squeeze russia out of yourself

256
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,519
we russians will understand that uh the

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,959
long uh

258
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:56,560
which is

259
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,480
this is a metaphor and this is a

260
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:03,360
reference to anton chefs anton chekhov's

261
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,920
quotation but really what does it mean

262
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,839
it means nothing

263
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,240
squeeze russia out of yourself it's i

264
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,959
don't know it's satire it's not harmful

265
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,200
to the authorities to anybody but a man

266
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,959
was sent to prison for a few years for

267
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,760
this okay well yes this is this also

268
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
sounds very similar to turkey i'm sure

269
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,320
zela will be sharing uh similar examples

270
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,480
uh that are absurd but uh

271
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,320
on the other side of this coin is uh

272
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,000
surveillance so this is where i want to

273
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
go to andre

274
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,839
so what is this uh

275
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:36,480
how are uh you know russian um how is

276
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,000
the russian state

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
doing on surveillance are they really

278
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,440
intercepting communications who are they

279
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,040
listening to what do they want to find

280
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:44,560
out

281
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,519
uh well it's getting more and more uh

282
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,279
effective uh

283
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:53,440
with years so uh we have in place a very

284
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,519
intrusive system of uh targeted

285
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,240
surveillance uh which is basically a

286
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
system of backdoors every russian

287
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,279
internet service provider

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,880
is required by law uh to have a backdoor

289
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:09,760
uh and to give access to russian

290
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,480
security services to provide

291
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,680
access to our premises and

292
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,040
cables and databases completely

293
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,000
unrestricted and uh with no way to

294
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,839
control what is actually access it and

295
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,959
what kind of information intercepted but

296
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,560
right now we

297
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
i would say that the rational four which

298
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,399
is uh put this on on the next level

299
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,560
because we have a new system of uh the

300
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,440
so-called sovereign uh internet uh which

301
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:39,839
is a combination of two things it's uh

302
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,760
it's a surveillance but it's also a

303
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,560
censorship and it's also

304
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,440
gives an authority a tool

305
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
to

306
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,720
redirect the traffic

307
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,320
from a particular region or to a

308
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,959
particular region and it works like that

309
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,600
if you have some problems uh in say

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,040
siberia

311
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
uh in the forest uh and you do not want

312
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,680
this

313
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,720
protest to spread to other regions

314
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,920
uh you can cut off uh the internet

315
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,079
connection to this region or out of this

316
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,839
region

317
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,240
and it's extremely uh extremely

318
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,440
effective

319
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,600
the other option we have for this system

320
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,800
is that

321
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,320
the devices

322
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,440
which

323
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,000
excuse me we are uh introduced and

324
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,760
installed on the premises of all

325
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,680
internet service providers in the

326
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,480
country uh how to observe for it is to

327
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,480
put more pressure on global platforms

328
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,839
like twitter

329
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
and this spring we saw how twitter was

330
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,800
uh slowed down

331
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,920
uh in the country thanks to this system

332
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,160
because they uh they started using these

333
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,720
devices and it's uh basically it's deep

334
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,240
packet inspection

335
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,800
and big and this technology

336
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,680
uh provides you with the opportunity to

337
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,240
uh to redirect the traffic or to take

338
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,279
down some uh some particular uh traffics

339
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,760
but it also uh helps you to look into

340
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,800
the traffic and to identify

341
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,200
uh particular ways particular kinds of

342
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,600
traffic or particular messages

343
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,519
and so the russian system of

344
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,760
surveillance is getting better and

345
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,800
better

346
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,320
and in combination with all the

347
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,839
restriction

348
00:13:19,839 --> 00:13:22,399
legislation we already have in place

349
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,720
uh to be honest that the picture is

350
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,240
looking quite blick right now

351
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,399
and the other problem is the last one

352
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,560
which i wanted to mention that

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,760
uh

354
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,720
russia is one of the very few countries

355
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,000
where local

356
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,839
uh social media

357
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,040
are much more popular than global media

358
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,920
uh so we still have kentucky and adna

359
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,279
class nikkei

360
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,399
really popular

361
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:49,920
so of course we have facebook and

362
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,160
twitter and google and they're still

363
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,160
accessible for users but they are not

364
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,680
that popular

365
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,000
and the problem with local social media

366
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,839
that we are cooperating

367
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:02,079
uh very closely we have russian security

368
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:05,199
services and uh with many cases actually

369
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,320
with 98 of the cases of prosecution of

370
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,320
the users of social media

371
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
we have the cases of the users of the

372
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,680
russian social media

373
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:18,000
okay this is an interesting uh

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,079
statistic but i have a

375
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:21,199
a question

376
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,120
which might not be very uh informal and

377
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,360
educated but about these uh

378
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,440
deep packages inspections and you know

379
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,199
provider service providers using them

380
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,120
isn't this very costly as an

381
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,040
infrastructure how are how are the local

382
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,639
companies uh

383
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,880
you know dealing with this or uh because

384
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,199
no because you said it got effective

385
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,760
uh does it should you know is it

386
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,000
financially doable or how are these

387
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,040
companies

388
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,199
what stage are they at yeah it's it's

389
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,800
actually a very good question because

390
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,120
for many many years

391
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,800
and it started

392
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:53,839
uh

393
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,199
literally in the 1990s as fsb as the

394
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,079
russian security service uh tried to and

395
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,959
actually was quite successful at uh

396
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,959
putting pressure on the

397
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,800
isps to install these devices and uh

398
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,440
forum devices back then uh surveillance

399
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,639
devices and to force the companies pay

400
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,079
for these devices

401
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:19,040
and that actually caused a lot of uh

402
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,240
uh

403
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,839
noise from uh from russian

404
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,440
telecommunications industry because they

405
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
didn't want to pay for these devices

406
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,279
because these devices should be

407
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:30,639
constantly updated but recently

408
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,440
scrambling now learned his lesson

409
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
so for the new system of the sovereign

410
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:36,480
internet

411
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,560
as the government said that we are ready

412
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,800
to pay and we are ready to send to these

413
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,120
devices and to deliver these devices to

414
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,079
you

415
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,880
and that would give us uh the leverage

416
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,360
so you you have no way to say no

417
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,120
but it also gives

418
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,720
the government the opportunity to

419
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,360
control these devices remotely

420
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,720
from moscow

421
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,720
so very first time in our history we

422
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,199
have literally it's a center

423
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,279
specifically built in moscow where you

424
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,160
can

425
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,800
control the traffic all over the country

426
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,199
and remotely play with this traffic so

427
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:11,120
if you have some problems in severe some

428
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,680
problems in central russia uh we have

429
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,000
some protests or maybe even a natural

430
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,360
catastrophe and you want to limit access

431
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,519
of people outside of this region to this

432
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,759
kind of information you now have his

433
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:28,160
option and you can do that remotely

434
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,560
that is very alarming and it sounds very

435
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,880
much something like turkey would do you

436
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,800
know we'll pay for you for your and

437
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,320
actually the funny thing is that when

438
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,240
the government says we'll pay for you

439
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,600
we're actually paying you know as

440
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,160
taxpayers from our own pockets for this

441
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,199
censorship and uh that that's

442
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,279
again one of those points where

443
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,160
uh

444
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:49,839
where i can under i can't relate to this

445
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:52,560
but i can completely understand uh

446
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,519
this

447
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,759
this approach that the government has

448
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,519
and this is a

449
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,040
something that might also come up in

450
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,560
turkey where i think

451
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,560
this surveillance and interception part

452
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:05,439
is not very effective i can say you know

453
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,959
based on the indictments we've seen

454
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,559
after the coup attempt

455
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,400
there weren't many you know intercepted

456
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,000
emails or whatever every digital

457
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,760
document pretty much in thousands of

458
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:15,520
thousands of pages of indictment we've

459
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,199
seen

460
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,039
any uh information

461
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,679
uh uh that was exchanged online would be

462
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:24,720
basically uh seized uh by seizing a

463
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
physical device so i think turkey

464
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,880
doesn't have this infrastructure or

465
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,679
but if they get this idea they'll find

466
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:33,039
ways so

467
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,280
so this i want to turn to zelal here so

468
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
what is going on in turkey what is this

469
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,240
social media law because they uh

470
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,400
you know on the regular they've been uh

471
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
blocking

472
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,679
news reports especially about erdogan's

473
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,240
family and like what like irina said

474
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,960
it's not very clear what is allowed and

475
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,480
what is not you know there's uh these

476
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,080
it's very hard to navigate especially

477
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,000
for a journalist an activist what is the

478
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,559
situation

479
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,880
um

480
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,919
as we know turkey is going through a

481
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,880
time frequent restrictions of the

482
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
right to freedom of expression

483
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,400
and the press and actually

484
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,559
i was also thinking

485
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,000
where to start

486
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,280
uh

487
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,320
to talk

488
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,280
about

489
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,480
and i think it would be it would be good

490
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,400
to mention uh

491
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,039
2016

492
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,080
and say a few words about the new

493
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:31,919
internet law

494
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:32,960
because

495
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,200
in the aftermath of the

496
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,799
coup attempt of

497
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:38,559
15 july

498
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,200
italy at least almost

499
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:45,120
200 media outlets have been closed down

500
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,600
approximately

501
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,120
approximately over a

502
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
2 000 journalists lost their jobs

503
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,080
and dozens of journalists have been

504
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,720
arrested and the government control on

505
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:00,559
printed media outlets increased to

506
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,120
a 95 percent

507
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:03,840
and

508
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,160
given the continuously intensifying

509
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,039
pressure on the offline and online media

510
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,840
outlets in the independent journalists

511
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,240
have started to call me their news

512
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:17,919
reports to their audience mainly on the

513
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,039
internet using social media platforms

514
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,360
instead of traditional press

515
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,799
organizations

516
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,280
in parallel citizens seeking channels

517
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,799
for independent news and for

518
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
free expression like this

519
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,440
turn to social media

520
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,919
among them are mean social groups and

521
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,559
humorous activists that are unable to

522
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,640
make their voices heard and

523
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,720
government-controlled mainstream media

524
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,480
and then social media has turned into a

525
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:52,799
public space public space

526
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:55,679
in turkey where many social segments

527
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,400
meet different voices can be heard and

528
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,080
journalists can share news their needs

529
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,360
now um

530
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:04,880
[Music]

531
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,440
at the moment facebook has

532
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:13,000
37 million users in turkey and uh

533
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,120
13.6 million

534
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,760
in an attempt to catch up with this new

535
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,080
digital reality the government has

536
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,520
started to also target the internet the

537
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
sole remaining channel to share

538
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,520
different options

539
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:30,080
in addition to trials of thousands of

540
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,520
people for their posts on the internet

541
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:36,400
access panned to websites and content

542
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,320
removals

543
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,520
a new law tightening to the use of

544
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
social media platforms has been adopted

545
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,640
in july

546
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,400
in july

547
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:51,400
2020

548
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:55,200
this new regulation known as um

549
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,159
social media law entered into first

550
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:01,679
last october

551
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,760
it creates the category of social

552
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,159
network providers for

553
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,760
real or

554
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
legal entertains

555
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,200
allowing users to create vive or share

556
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,880
online contact

557
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,840
such as text visual contact

558
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,280
uh voice recordings and locations online

559
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,159
for social interaction purposes

560
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:24,960
and

561
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
consequently it also introduces a range

562
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,240
of obligations for online platforms such

563
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,600
as twitter facebook instagram and

564
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:34,960
youtube

565
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
which fall under

566
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:40,480
the category of social network providers

567
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,080
and in line with the new legislation all

568
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,840
foreign-based social network providers

569
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,039
with more than one million daily access

570
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,320
from turkey are obligated to appoint a

571
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,600
legal representative in the country

572
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,158
moreover

573
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,840
the the

574
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,600
social network providers are required to

575
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,159
store the data of their users from

576
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:11,360
turkey inside the country

577
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,080
the local storage of personal data

578
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,240
results in the possibility of judicial

579
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,159
and administrative authorities to

580
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,720
replace this data

581
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,000
question

582
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,200
about this

583
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:25,280
so when so this social media companies

584
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,480
in turkey

585
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,559
youtube twitter they have all said yes

586
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,720
we're coming to turkey right

587
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,559
yes so this is a how do lawyers see this

588
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:35,679
for um

589
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,280
so when you just said that you know they

590
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:40,159
have to share local data

591
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,240
of people but with turkey will be turkey

592
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,200
be able to um follow this

593
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,120
on for example

594
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,720
uh people

595
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,919
secondly

596
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,000
one other thing is that for example if

597
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,760
for example what in russia right twitter

598
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,760
didn't take up content or maybe they did

599
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,080
but they weren't slow and so they used

600
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,679
these uh

601
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,400
deep inspection packages and slowed them

602
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,360
down and there are things but

603
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,559
for example if

604
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,280
turkey wants to wants an account

605
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
to be uh shut down how is that legally

606
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:13,919
possible i mean if the person is turkey

607
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:14,720
or

608
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,600
uh

609
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,520
or in in france for example we have a

610
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:19,520
lot of exiled journalists in germany

611
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,240
there so how and they say oh shut this

612
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,159
account uh dance remove it from the

613
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,000
platform can they do it physically what

614
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,760
is i mean legally that's what the law

615
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,400
says but is it possible

616
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,640
uh

617
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,679
with any regulation yes it's possible

618
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:37,440
and uh

619
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,440
for example the government claims to

620
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,120
prote protect citizens with uh these

621
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,400
days laws uh the personal data status

622
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
personal data

623
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,919
for combating

624
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:53,360
cybercrime and hit speech with

625
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,679
this new law

626
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:56,559
and

627
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,960
the most important thing

628
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,559
when the draft law was discussed in the

629
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,760
parliament uh the government said that

630
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,919
there are such regulations in many

631
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,520
european countries especially in germany

632
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,320
but

633
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,640
i think the

634
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:19,279
in the enthusiastic of adapting such

635
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,799
regulations in europe to turkey leads to

636
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,000
more

637
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,120
oppressive results here

638
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:27,919
uh

639
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,520
actually from the submission of the

640
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,840
draft law as you know

641
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:35,919
into parliament in july 2020

642
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:38,159
um

643
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,240
until today uh

644
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:43,440
this social media law um

645
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:46,799
has remained strongly contested ngos

646
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:50,480
journalists and activists working to

647
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,960
protect the needs

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:54,159
and

649
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,120
freedom of expression

650
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,520
called repeatedly for social media

651
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:03,600
companies not to comply with the law

652
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,919
and they were calling it

653
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,240
and they are still calling it the

654
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,480
censorship law

655
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
and they

656
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:15,039
drew attention to its role of taking

657
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:16,559
censorship to

658
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:19,600
a more suffocative level and of creating

659
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,240
potential dangerous consequences for

660
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,440
citizens by completely removing the data

661
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,080
security

662
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,799
just right here i want to go to adrian

663
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,279
and uh so uh this is an interesting

664
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:35,200
point uh you know the the compliance of

665
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,640
these uh social media companies

666
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,080
unfortunately none of their

667
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,760
representatives are here with us but

668
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,440
adrian do you uh uh uh does uh freedom

669
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,320
uh house research find that uh you know

670
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,960
stricter or authoritarian countries are

671
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,840
end up passing increasingly similar laws

672
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,400
to control social media and secondly how

673
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,799
are the big tech companies approaching

674
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:58,559
this are they um

675
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
are they saying okay at some point like

676
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,279
they did in turkey or you know how how

677
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:06,640
are things uh globally

678
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,279
yeah thank you so much for having me um

679
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,320
we are seeing common approaches among

680
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,000
authoritarian governments around

681
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,520
regulating social media i think the

682
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
aspects of that playbook are many things

683
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,760
that andre um irene and zila have

684
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,600
mentioned around you know data

685
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,039
localization

686
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,440
um anti-encryption measures

687
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:26,400
uh

688
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,200
changing intermediary liability laws or

689
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,760
forcing companies to quickly remove um

690
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,240
what they call illegal content um

691
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,080
establi you know appointing a local

692
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,400
representative so i think these are all

693
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,360
parts of that playbook that we're seeing

694
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,600
spread around the world

695
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,559
this is often combined with

696
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,000
the the tactic of blocking or throttling

697
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,840
social media platforms

698
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,799
as a means to coerce these companies to

699
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,880
do the government's bidding so it's

700
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,640
essentially a

701
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,960
governments are doing all that they can

702
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,679
to i think increase their leverage

703
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,400
over social media companies so that they

704
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,919
can force them

705
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,919
into complying with demands for

706
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:12,799
censorship or to hand over data and they

707
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:13,919
do that

708
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,240
by threatening to just prevent access at

709
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,840
all to the country which you know would

710
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,760
have disastrous economic consequences

711
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,399
but also for their users uh would have

712
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:24,240
disastrous consequences for you know

713
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,559
access to information media freedom and

714
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,399
free expression

715
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,000
i should say you know you mentioned how

716
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,000
our company is dealing with that and i

717
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,679
think you know i don't have a secret

718
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:36,559
window into their own processes but i do

719
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:38,559
know that um

720
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,240
in in 2020 for example facebook agreed

721
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,960
to remove so-called anti-government uh

722
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,240
or anti-state content in vietnam that's

723
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,840
a country where internet freedom has

724
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,799
declined in recent years

725
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:55,360
you've had state-owned telecoms that

726
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,120
were constantly threatening to

727
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
throttle access to facebook and so

728
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,520
facebook essentially it appears had a

729
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,120
choice of essentially remaining

730
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,679
accessible in the country or

731
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,720
complying with some form of censorship

732
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,559
from the government

733
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:15,360
i should also mention though that these

734
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,279
measures in this playbook

735
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,600
is uh not only being introduced in

736
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,200
countries in our methodology that are

737
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,200
ranked as not free they're also there in

738
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,600
partly free and also free countries and

739
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,880
i think the the big example from

740
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,520
the past year or so is in india where

741
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
both democracy and internet freedom have

742
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,679
declined in recent years

743
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,120
and there the government has just

744
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,399
implemented something called the

745
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:41,279
information technology rules of 2021

746
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,240
which you know no surprise forces tech

747
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,640
companies to appoint a representative

748
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:48,720
and allows the government to restrict

749
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,440
access to um platforms that do not

750
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,760
comply with takedown requests

751
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,840
there's also this the second component

752
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,559
of the law in india which mimics

753
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,559
something that we had seen from many of

754
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,279
the five eyes governments um

755
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,360
which are you know the experts in

756
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:07,440
intelligence and surveillance and that

757
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,520
is in the indian law compels tech

758
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:11,840
platforms to retain

759
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:15,200
user data for 180 days even after users

760
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:17,039
accounts have been deleted

761
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:19,279
and importantly to identify the

762
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,000
so-called first original of encrypted

763
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,919
messages and that's something that

764
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:25,520
whatsapp is actually challenging in

765
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:27,919
court so this is an example where in a

766
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:31,120
more let's say partly free country where

767
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,760
rule of law exists the judiciary does

768
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:36,559
have a little bit more independence

769
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,039
we are seeing companies use the legal

770
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:40,880
system in order to challenge this

771
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,440
whenever possible um but yes this is

772
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,200
something that we're seeing i think

773
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,960
spread to all countries along the

774
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:50,640
democratic spectrum in different ways

775
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:53,600
so yeah this is very interesting and i

776
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:55,919
uh just a quick question one question

777
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,159
about india do you uh

778
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,159
you know given the judicial structures

779
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,159
of the country does uh whatsapp slow

780
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:04,399
suit have any chance really this is uh

781
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,159
or is i mean are the judges gonna look

782
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:07,600
at this technically or if they do this

783
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,120
they can't do encryption anymore so it

784
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,000
can't be done or are they going to be

785
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,760
or in for any of these other countries

786
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,200
can

787
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,520
what remains as legal recourse is it

788
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,720
[Music]

789
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:21,840
is it there actually

790
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,240
we have seen some um

791
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,399
some positive successes around you know

792
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,240
strategic litigation

793
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,520
um in india the judiciary has been you

794
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,360
know has a mixed record i think that

795
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,399
there was a um a very landmark a

796
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,240
landmark case a few years ago where they

797
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,919
outlined the or they defined the rights

798
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:41,840
of privacy in india

799
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,159
and similarly there has been quite a bit

800
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,559
of tension between the judiciary and the

801
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:48,720
government in the country the question

802
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,640
is whether the government

803
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,200
cares um whether the you know whether

804
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:55,840
the uh the administration there is

805
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:57,840
willing essentially to

806
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,640
um surpass checks and balances and you

807
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,640
know the constitution in order to force

808
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
the digi to not comply with the

809
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
judiciary that's something that we've

810
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,880
seen around with the aadhaar biometric

811
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
ib system in the country but i think

812
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
more broadly we have seen some good

813
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,840
examples from brazil from indonesia and

814
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,399
even in sudan where and in pakistan

815
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,279
where we have seen the courts being used

816
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,360
in a way to um

817
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,399
to

818
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:27,039
let's say push forward to reverse a

819
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,120
negative law or to enshrine human rights

820
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,880
online

821
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:34,720
well i think in the case of turkey and

822
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,399
russia this

823
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:38,080
this is a bit different sometimes you

824
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,919
get good court decisions but most of the

825
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,120
time

826
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
they're very integrated the uh to the

827
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,480
state i'm this is not about the

828
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,279
of course independence of judiciary but

829
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:51,360
speaking for these two countries i think

830
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,679
it is a major uh problem

831
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,760
enabling these governments to continue

832
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,399
because the courts rarely surprise us

833
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,760
unfortunately

834
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,440
because how the system is ingrained but

835
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,559
uh but

836
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:03,919
it's good to know that there's hope in

837
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:06,720
other countries and so um i want to go

838
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,600
back to irena and andre with a question

839
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,919
and but also i want to open the floor to

840
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:13,840
any questions or comments

841
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:15,600
so we will be now seeking answers to

842
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,200
maybe what can be done

843
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,519
and as i said initially we don't all

844
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:22,159
have the answers at all times so if you

845
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,320
have any questions or any comments if

846
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,320
you want to share experiences

847
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,120
please do you they don't necessarily uh

848
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,720
need to be questions we're very open to

849
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,000
ideas uh but uh uh

850
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,159
because more on the technical side uh so

851
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,480
irina and andre what can uh

852
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:40,480
journalists or users is there anything

853
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:43,600
that can be done as a user i know maybe

854
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,799
include yourself technically to to uh

855
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,600
um and work around these um

856
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,919
surveillance or

857
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:54,080
or censorship or

858
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,159
when it gets to a level of where you

859
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,320
know they're using good software good

860
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,919
technology like where russia is going

861
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,159
where china are we we don't have any

862
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:04,399
chances or what is there anything that

863
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,360
can be

864
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,240
done

865
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,080
um

866
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,679
the problem has the problem you

867
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,000
described has two parts the first part

868
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,200
is uh

869
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,840
it is about uh

870
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
public speech if you wanna if you wanna

871
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,600
say something publicly if you wanna

872
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,600
publish something as a journalist you

873
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,480
can't

874
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,360
uh you can be anonymous so it means all

875
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,760
technical solutions are

876
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,760
uh useless for you because you want to

877
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,200
be listened to by many

878
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,960
by a lot of people

879
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,000
uh

880
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,919
the second part of the problem is when

881
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,600
you wanted to communicate secret

882
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,360
secretly with your sources as a

883
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:44,080
journalist and you want to avoid uh

884
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:45,360
surveillance

885
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:48,399
this problem uh so far in russia you can

886
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:50,480
solve this problem you is this problem

887
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:53,519
using uh using a lot of

888
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:56,880
a lot of technical tools like uh secret

889
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,399
uh like uh

890
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:00,399
like messengers

891
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:04,240
as signal and even whatsapp is quite

892
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,799
it is quite safe in russia and also you

893
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:09,839
can use a lot of you can use uh decree

894
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,119
encryption

895
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,159
and many other

896
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,520
technical tools

897
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,159
to avoid surveillance but

898
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,800
the assorted because russia is a country

899
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,399
of total surveillance and uh techniques

900
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:26,639
that authorities use are extremely

901
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:29,440
advanced uh sometimes it's difficult

902
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,000
because your devices can be infected by

903
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,399
virus and you can avoid

904
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,639
surveillance you can be physically

905
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:38,960
stopped with your devices at the borders

906
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,280
or registry by the police and your

907
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,280
devices can be deprived to stripped of

908
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,280
you and searched by the authorities

909
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,079
which is also you can of course you can

910
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,879
encrypted part of your information but

911
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,639
when you're under physical

912
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,399
under physical pressure

913
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,159
uh

914
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,280
of the police uh you can't

915
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:01,760
you can't save your uh your passwords

916
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,440
you have to you have to give your

917
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,240
password them and so but it depends it

918
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:08,079
depends you can't you can't communicate

919
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,680
with your sources anonymously still

920
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,680
and maybe taking it offline a little bit

921
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,839
i don't know where the you know also the

922
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:17,680
picture that adrian drew is where the

923
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,520
world is of course the internet is

924
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,560
always evolving you know the uh users or

925
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,560
you know technical people find new ways

926
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,240
governments find new ways and you know

927
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,400
the use of signal has also increased in

928
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,920
turkey and but i uh in general i'm not

929
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,920
sure if the general uh journalist

930
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,240
population is very um knowledgeable

931
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,839
about uh these not only knowledgeable

932
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:39,760
but there's also user habits that are

933
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,160
hard to change so maybe part of it is

934
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,359
for us to basically um be more smart

935
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:48,320
about our internet usage and there are

936
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,079
also some comments that i just want to

937
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:52,960
go through so uh so katie rodriguez

946
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
social media content removal in turkey

947
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,640

948
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,880
response to it which is yes the answer

949
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,160
uh that we're

950
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,680
looking for well thank you for this and

951
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,000
also the link is uh

952
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,240
in the chat i don't know if everybody

953
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,359
can see that

954
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:28,720
uh i think so and so this is yes these

955
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,599
are questions for uh for uh the

956
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,960
for everyone but uh in in terms of uh

957
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,880
your experience would you say that our

958
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:39,839
journalists and or lawyers also who have

959
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,920
come under attack are more aware of

960
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,599
these uh

961
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:46,320
i don't know ways to protect themselves

962
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,920
and secondly how can you protect

963
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,200
yourself on

964
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,960
social media legally or is there any

965
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:55,079
chance of this at all

966
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,320
and and you're uh you asked this

967
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:02,160
question to whom i asked it to the

968
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,960
election so sorry yes

969
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,280
actually i think that

970
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:11,040
uh the freedom of expression and

971
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,720
internet freedoms

972
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,280
are in dangerous for many years in

973
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:21,200
turkey and um as i said or as i

974
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,960
saw um

975
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,200
in the eyes of the

976
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:28,320
turkish civil society organizations

977
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,800
including mlsa

978
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,320
and um

979
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,760
the

980
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:36,079
for example the new social media law is

981
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:39,040
an attempt on the part of the

982
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,720
government to

983
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,960
monopolize the

984
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,280
information flow online and to expose

985
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,079
citizens to stricter

986
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,400
surveillance and control

987
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,240
actually what i point out that um

988
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,440
in fact the pressure on social media in

989
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:00,240
turkey is increasing in cases of

990
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,839
emergency

991
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,800
and what i think and

992
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,400
what we see especially at the time of

993
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,640
military operations

994
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,520
or

995
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:14,000
corruption investigations

996
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,680
or

997
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,359
any prosecution or anything yes about

998
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,520
the

999
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,280
president's family

1000
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:28,480
in this situation the government blocks

1001
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,280
access to the internet and

1002
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,480
also many social media users are under

1003
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:36,560
investigations and prosecutions for

1004
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:40,240
making terrorist propaganda or insulting

1005
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,599
and

1006
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:42,960
yes

1007
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,960
we are trying to protect and promoting

1008
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
the internet freedoms and freedom of

1009
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
exploration of citizens

1010
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:55,040
or everyone and

1011
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:59,119
in this context we as i men say object

1012
00:38:59,119 --> 00:38:59,839
access today's

1013
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,280
decisions

1014
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,320
and if necessary we applied also to the

1015
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,400
constitutional court and strasbourg

1016
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,480
court to combat

1017
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:09,440
the

1018
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,119
censorship

1019
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:13,760
and i think that

1020
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:17,240
social media is one of the most

1021
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,119
indispensable uh channels of our age

1022
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:23,280
and therefore i would like to point out

1023
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:24,720
that international

1024
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,280
solidarity and strategy against all

1025
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:31,680
kinds of censorship are important and

1026
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,880
it's really bad to say that but

1027
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,480
i think the

1028
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,200
government

1029
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:43,200
will continue to

1030
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:47,919
block the internet access and uh

1031
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,560
will continue to pressure to the

1032
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,400
citizens and

1033
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:55,040
their freedom of expression

1034
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,520
and freedom of press

1035
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:00,240
and we have to try to combat against

1036
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,480
that so it's very depressing but we have

1037
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,960
a very good question and then i yes we

1038
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:06,640
partially touched upon this uh so

1039
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:09,680
tatiana margolin is asking is there any

1040
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:12,240
potential in working with platforms you

1041
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,920
all touched on this but can you address

1042
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:16,480
this more explicitly this is a good

1043
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,079
question and also if the audience has

1044
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:20,560
any views on this but our platforms

1045
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,960
trends pose can we work with them what

1046
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,280
are your thoughts on on this andre irina

1047
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,760
andre uh adrian if you have anything to

1048
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,839
add this is very interesting

1049
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,760
finally it's something something more

1050
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,599
optimistic

1051
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:35,920
uh well actually uh

1052
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,000
even facebook uh i should admit is uh is

1053
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,880
actually is uh responding to russian uh

1054
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,400
journalists uh

1055
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:47,680
request and uh if something is taken

1056
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:51,599
down because uh say trolls report to you

1057
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,760
are falsely that you posted something

1058
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,960
like a

1059
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:58,079
naked picture and it's not the case

1060
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:00,720
but some algorithms of facebook

1061
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,880
take your page down well usually

1062
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,359
facebook responds to this request and uh

1063
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:08,880
and get back your uh

1064
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,079
get back your

1065
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:12,880
uh access to your page and uh it's

1066
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,079
getting better

1067
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,560
uh with whatsapp you have the same story

1068
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,319
that actually

1069
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:20,400
uh facebook is

1070
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:21,599
responsive

1071
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:24,720
uh even with twitter uh i will say that

1072
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,200
the picture is a bit more uh optimistic

1073
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,200
when the russian authorities try to

1074
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,359
uh to present it uh so the russian

1075
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,520
authorities claimed victory saying like

1076
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,880
twitter removed and took down all other

1077
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,720
messages all the posts they wanted to

1078
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:41,040
remove but actually it's about the

1079
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,319
protests which took place in february

1080
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:45,200
and

1081
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:47,359
well it's of course it's still the case

1082
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,520
but i think uh

1083
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:51,440
the interesting thing is that it's not

1084
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:54,160
going on live so it's not going on right

1085
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,480
now like when you have protests going on

1086
00:41:56,480 --> 00:41:57,680
and uh

1087
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,440
the russian authorities would love to

1088
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,240
have

1089
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,680
a direct line of communication to

1090
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,319
twitter to ask them to take down uh

1091
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:06,160
messages to the protests which are going

1092
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,240
on right now but it's not what is going

1093
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:08,960
on

1094
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,440
uh with google also

1095
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,040
yes we have uh youtube uh going under

1096
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,599
immense pressure and right now they have

1097
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:18,560
courts

1098
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,520
uh

1099
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,640
finding google for more and more and

1100
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,800
more and it's uh

1101
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:27,200
at the end of the year we expect google

1102
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:29,599
to be funded for one billion dollar

1103
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:30,960
maybe more

1104
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,599
and all in order to force it in the

1105
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,599
corporation but

1106
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:38,160
so far it's not very successful

1107
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:40,319
and also we need to remember two things

1108
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:42,000
that usually this pressure on global

1109
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,560
platforms goes into direction one

1110
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,560
direction is taking down messages and

1111
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,800
posts and in this

1112
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,240
well uh

1113
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,319
area it's slightly

1114
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,440
mou

1115
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,440
i would say successful

1116
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,760
but the second option uh the second

1117
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,960
direction

1118
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,119
the russian government wants to pursue

1119
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:04,400
is to force global platforms to share

1120
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,280
personal data

1121
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:10,240
and communications

1122
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,599
which are private

1123
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,760
and uh so far i would say it very

1124
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,560
carefully uh global platforms resist uh

1125
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:20,160
this pressure so i never had of any case

1126
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,720
uh prosecuted bazaar footages where you

1127
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,000
have like uh whatsapp or facebook

1128
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:29,680
messenger data or twitter data uh

1129
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:32,160
well presented to the court uh which is

1130
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,720
a good sign

1131
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,359
sorry i couldn't unmute myself

1132
00:43:41,359 --> 00:43:44,079
i agree with this but also just taking

1133
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:46,079
on from this agent is i asked you this

1134
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,160
question earlier and so there's some

1135
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,079
positivity and they are

1136
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:52,640
not very openly willing to share uh user

1137
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,560
data that's why they're pressured like

1138
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,880
andre very nicely uh

1139
00:43:56,880 --> 00:43:58,560
summarized but there's also been a

1140
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,240
criticism of platforms again i give of

1141
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:01,599
course we don't know they're not here

1142
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:04,400
but of for example the uh the protests

1143
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,880
in palestine or the the farmer protest

1144
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,200
in india and colombia other parts so

1145
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:11,119
there's also that aspect where they seem

1146
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:12,480
to be um

1147
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:15,200
i don't know seem to be uh basically

1148
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,119
knowingly or unknowingly this is not an

1149
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:19,280
indictment of any any platform and this

1150
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,640
can also work against uh against us as

1151
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,560
well so uh

1152
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,240
how does that work in other countries

1153
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,480
again with the platforms

1154
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,160
with the yes they have a positive role

1155
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,079
but do all do they also have a negative

1156
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:34,319
role especially for countries like

1157
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:36,160
turkey and russia or of course there are

1158
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,280
no other countries like turkey and

1159
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:38,400
russia but

1160
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:40,640
but whereas uh whereas uh you know who

1161
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,319
are in that stricter authoritarian

1162
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:44,560
direction

1163
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,119
yeah it's a similar trend um i think you

1164
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:48,839
know you were talking about

1165
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:53,040
um the events that happen you know in in

1166
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:58,240
palestine um recently and the the um

1167
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,839
from all that we can say from the

1168
00:44:59,839 --> 00:45:02,000
outside what appears to be like a lot of

1169
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:04,240
censorship against the speech of

1170
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
palestinian activists or even just

1171
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:08,800
ordinary palestinians um people in

1172
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,400
diaspora who were using hashtags um

1173
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,760
around the conflict um i would note that

1174
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,040
you know

1175
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:19,359
what tends to happen is that when

1176
00:45:19,359 --> 00:45:21,280
platforms are oftentimes caught off

1177
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:22,240
guard

1178
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,520
then they do invest um

1179
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,520
resources and

1180
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:28,160
and

1181
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,040
people

1182
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:30,480
into remedying that situation

1183
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,400
particularly when it causes a public

1184
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,319
relations crisis

1185
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,280
and so

1186
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,319
i saw just today i believe that

1187
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:40,960
twitter for example has just brought

1188
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,960
hamlet which is a palestinian digital

1189
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,640
rights organization

1190
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,319
which has been doing a lot of the great

1191
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,960
documentation of um you know

1192
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:50,800
unjustifiable takedowns of palestinian

1193
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:52,880
speech they've brought that organization

1194
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:56,079
onto their trust and safety council um

1195
00:45:56,079 --> 00:45:57,839
as part of their broader you know human

1196
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:00,160
rights initiative so i think that there

1197
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:02,720
is a lot of room there there is some

1198
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,920
room for optimism here in terms of when

1199
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,760
when there are these instances when we

1200
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
see platforms failing to

1201
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:12,400
meet their obligations under you know

1202
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:14,800
business and human rights principles

1203
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,880
after they come under

1204
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,160
quite a bit of pressure and i think

1205
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,680
that's the role of civil society

1206
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:22,640
essentially is to provide that oversight

1207
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:26,960
um of platforms in a way that may lead

1208
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,200
to better outcomes than when governments

1209
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,119
get involved because we have the

1210
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:35,359
examples you know from from turkey from

1211
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,920
russia and from others of how you know

1212
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:40,319
government regulation

1213
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:41,520
tends to

1214
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,880
uh incentivize the the removal of not

1215
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,760
only illegal speech but as we see even

1216
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:49,920
in democracies like the uk

1217
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:52,160
um of speech that could be deemed as

1218
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,839
harmful but not illegal so um you know

1219
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,880
it's a very complex balance to be played

1220
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,920
around essentially how can we

1221
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,480
among you know people in civil society

1222
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:06,880
play to uh

1223
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:09,599
almost let's say use the the tensions

1224
00:47:09,599 --> 00:47:12,319
between governments and and platforms um

1225
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:15,119
as a way to make it a race to the top

1226
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:18,800
and to you know at times where pressure

1227
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,400
particularly in democracies around

1228
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:23,839
regulation has led to better outcomes in

1229
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:26,240
terms of self-regulation

1230
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:28,480
but then also insisting when there are

1231
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,920
these instances around you know

1232
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,400
encryption or data localization or you

1233
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,520
know undermining intermediary

1234
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,920
reliability where civil society can also

1235
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:38,319
be on the side of platforms when

1236
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:40,480
relevant so you know i think it's it's

1237
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:42,240
never just

1238
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,160
believing that platforms are are the

1239
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:46,000
best and always the best protectors of

1240
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,640
free expression but i think

1241
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:50,960
rallying around certain building a

1242
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,839
coalition when appropriate in order to

1243
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,920
you know defend users to defend human

1244
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:58,000
rights on the platform and i think that

1245
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
you know we have started to see some

1246
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,559
progress um you know particularly around

1247
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,240
facebook that i think has been investing

1248
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,400
a lot in terms of creating the human

1249
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:09,520
rights framework hiring directors for

1250
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,040
human rights and a whole team that is

1251
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,720
devoted to that and then also

1252
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,800
mainstreaming these issues within their

1253
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,839
their public policy

1254
00:48:17,839 --> 00:48:20,319
okay that sounded a bit more uh hopeful

1255
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,079
but we uh we're we don't have much time

1256
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:23,599
so if you have any questions or comments

1257
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:25,440
but now i want to ask a

1258
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,920
one more painful question

1259
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,800
uh to both andre irina and zelen

1260
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,559
so so all of these are happening we're

1261
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:34,960
you know what are platforms doing

1262
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,880
democracies but

1263
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,839
my question is do people care because uh

1264
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,839
in turkey of course there's uh huge

1265
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:43,839
generational differences for younger

1266
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:46,079
people what they call generation z these

1267
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:48,000
are very important but for some other

1268
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,119
people when um in you know in countries

1269
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:53,119
such as ours where you know people are a

1270
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,440
bit more polarized or populism is in

1271
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,599
place then they can buy into these

1272
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,559
arguments for example uh if one of you

1273
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:02,720
said that know germany is also doing it

1274
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:05,680
or you know um or you know these uh

1275
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:07,440
platforms are you know the west is

1276
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,119
trying to undermine our country whatever

1277
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,520
and unfortunately there's a uh a lot of

1278
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,960
people because watching state news and

1279
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:15,760
because

1280
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:17,599
there's no free media are under the

1281
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:18,880
impression that you know the government

1282
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,599
might be right they're protecting us so

1283
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:24,000
do users really care about these

1284
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:26,000
restrictions the majority of them it's

1285
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,599
it's a hard question and i know there's

1286
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:31,119
generational differences but

1287
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:32,640
uh

1288
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,680
uh it depends uh the kremlin introduced

1289
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:38,240
the first system of internet's filtering

1290
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:41,200
uh eight it's eight years ago even in

1291
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,559
2012. so now nine years ago and back

1292
00:49:44,559 --> 00:49:47,119
then uh they started censoring internet

1293
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:50,480
very lazily and they didn't they didn't

1294
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,200
took down a lot of information back then

1295
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,440
and it was very easy to circumvent this

1296
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,400
censorship back then people told us that

1297
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,359
they most of people told us that they

1298
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,400
said they didn't pay attention to this

1299
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,520
censorship because there are so so much

1300
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,440
so much information on the on the

1301
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,119
internet but

1302
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:14,160
situations has worsened since then and

1303
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,040
like

1304
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,200
200 people uh

1305
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:19,599
now are under criminal investigations uh

1306
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,160
because of because uh because of their

1307
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:24,400
postings on social networks and it's

1308
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,559
it's a huge number

1309
00:50:26,559 --> 00:50:28,640
so people who are involved in some kind

1310
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:30,800
of political activity or people who are

1311
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,640
active on social networks they they care

1312
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:38,720
but 80 percent of population i think uh

1313
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:41,040
and that's not depends of the age

1314
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,960
they don't pay attention it's also in

1315
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:44,800
russia we have a huge divide between

1316
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,119
moscow big cities like moscow saints

1317
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:49,280
petersburg here catherine burke

1318
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,440
cities uh which which is bigger than one

1319
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,000
million which has a population bigger

1320
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,839
than one million people

1321
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:57,119
and uh

1322
00:50:57,119 --> 00:50:58,000
it's

1323
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,079
uh this is a one stories these people

1324
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,240
they are much more

1325
00:51:02,240 --> 00:51:03,440
um

1326
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:06,079
uh much more knowledgeable about what's

1327
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,000
going on on the night and they and and

1328
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,559
they they pay attention to internet

1329
00:51:10,559 --> 00:51:12,240
filtering and people in russian

1330
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:14,720
provinces who are just

1331
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,160
i i say

1332
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:18,720
uh how to put it not to be offensive to

1333
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:20,960
them then most of them they just don't

1334
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:23,359
pay attention what's going on because

1335
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,400
it's does not so far it does not

1336
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:28,640
interfere into their private life

1337
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,240
i would add only one thing that

1338
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:32,800
sometimes the government helped us to

1339
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,839
promote the need

1340
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:39,440
for uh well using vpns and circumvention

1341
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,599
tools because sometimes they made really

1342
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,040
stupid mistakes

1343
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,200
uh we spent lots of time trying to

1344
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,599
explain people why we need to use vpns

1345
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:49,599
and they always say something like well

1346
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:50,960
we don't care

1347
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,079
and one very perfect day

1348
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,920
the russian government decided to bond

1349
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,280
pornhub

1350
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,040
and immediately

1351
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,400
our country

1352
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,640
raised to the position number one and

1353
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:04,880
the number of users of thor just

1354
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:06,960
happened in one day because all these

1355
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:09,040
people in all these offices they just

1356
00:52:09,040 --> 00:52:10,800
got it but they cannot go to their

1357
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,440
beloved former hub uh the government

1358
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,920
went cancelled with this ban but it was

1359
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:20,319
already too late uh with the covet

1360
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:22,559
pandemic we got the same problem uh

1361
00:52:22,559 --> 00:52:24,640
nobody paid attention in the country to

1362
00:52:24,640 --> 00:52:26,559
face recognition system

1363
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:29,920
uh and then we got a video surveillance

1364
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:32,480
system and all of a sudden we got

1365
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:35,359
covered and we got thousands of people

1366
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:38,559
find it because they were identified uh

1367
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:42,480
breaking uh the regulation and um it's

1368
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:43,680
it's quite

1369
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,480
very refined on substational farms and

1370
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,800
all of a sudden people's ordinary people

1371
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,800
started talking about why we have so

1372
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,040
many face recognition cameras why we

1373
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,280
have such an intrusive system of social

1374
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:57,839
monitoring applications why we are

1375
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:00,079
forced to install all these apps if he

1376
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,079
got contracted corvette and why they

1377
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:05,440
find us and why they ask us to say

1378
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,520
to take pictures of us and free in the

1379
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,760
morning and send it to some russian

1380
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,520
sensors to check that we are still at

1381
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,160
home so sometimes we do these mistakes

1382
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,079
and it's actually it's quite good for

1383
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:19,520
uh say for the society

1384
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:21,920
this is interesting because this

1385
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:24,000
security thing sorry i know you wanted

1386
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,599
to say a word as well but

1387
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,920
these security cameras yes they

1388
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,680
are you know downloading apps they over

1389
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:31,839
time can work against you and this was a

1390
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:33,440
discussion in in turkey when they

1391
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:34,720
started uh

1392
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,520
you know

1393
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,960
putting out all these cameras on the

1394
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:39,280
city called mobise and oh you know this

1395
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,960
is good for your security and then after

1396
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:43,359
a while you know if you lose your wallet

1397
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:44,640
then the camera didn't work but if you

1398
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,640
were in gezi protests then they were

1399
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,720
easily identified and protested now

1400
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:50,559
people see this and they

1401
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,400
and actually unfortunately their real

1402
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:54,960
life examples can be very good teachers

1403
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:56,400
as well so there's a

1404
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:59,200
also that is about the uh also then uh

1405
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:00,960
there's a comment about this the fact

1406
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:02,720
that the wider audience does not care

1407
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:05,599
from america again is very much related

1408
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,319
to ignorance uh and there are uh

1409
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,160
media and digital literacy could be one

1410
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,160
of the answers yes of course this is uh

1411
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,240
again tied to media freedoms where you

1412
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,400
know uh people are watching this i don't

1413
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:17,520
know ahab

1414
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,400
this uh state channel padre canal and

1415
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,319
they they don't have this other it's not

1416
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:24,160
even ignorance it's just a different

1417
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,040
planet i think meant mindfully uh there

1418
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,760
on and also very one original asked

1419
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,280
another question

1420
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:33,520
uh us again about the the platform is

1421
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:35,200
there anything that the international

1422
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,720
community can do to help beyond

1423
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,280
statements and okay

1424
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,200
this we don't know but

1425
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,880
oh could they pressure social media

1426
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,079
companies

1427
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:46,799
etc yes uh adrian maybe you could uh

1428
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,960
tackle this question can can social

1429
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:52,319
media companies be i don't know

1430
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,480
be affected by the international

1431
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,960
community in any way

1432
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,400
well i think we're already seeing that

1433
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,200
you know i think that the the the

1434
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:03,119
policies and practices of social media

1435
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,799
companies have changed a lot over the

1436
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:06,640
past 10 years

1437
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,319
and over the past five years and a few

1438
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:12,240
years is so pressure always does help

1439
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,720
i think at the same time

1440
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,359
you know let's say that

1441
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:20,319
democracies particularly should be

1442
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:22,480
helping and you know supporting social

1443
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,960
media companies when it's relevant so

1444
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,040
when social media companies are coming

1445
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,480
under attack

1446
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,079
from the russian government from the

1447
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:31,520
turkish government from the union

1448
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,119
government you know

1449
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:37,040
um seeing it as in a an interest of

1450
00:55:37,040 --> 00:55:39,359
human rights for these governments to be

1451
00:55:39,359 --> 00:55:40,880
actually applying pressure on those

1452
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,000
governments

1453
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,960
not to be passing laws that restrict

1454
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:47,680
freedom of expression um or past you

1455
00:55:47,680 --> 00:55:49,599
know greater data collection and

1456
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,359
surveillance and i think it's also

1457
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:53,119
interesting to it's important to

1458
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:55,440
remember that even within governments

1459
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:56,559
there are

1460
00:55:56,559 --> 00:55:58,720
different um

1461
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,720
departments and so you know the it's

1462
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:02,400
it's not accurate to say

1463
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:03,760
that because the united states

1464
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,280
government is

1465
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:08,079
um you know on the one hand through

1466
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:10,240
the intelligence agencies seeking to spy

1467
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:12,720
on virtually everybody in the world but

1468
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,880
there are also you know departments

1469
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,240
within the united states government that

1470
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,760
are trying to do the opposite they're

1471
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,799
trying to

1472
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,960
um protect a free and open internet to

1473
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,880
protect internet freedom

1474
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,200
and so i think that there are ways that

1475
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:27,839
we can be building coalitions among you

1476
00:56:27,839 --> 00:56:30,480
know among certain governments are among

1477
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:32,240
certain you know policy makers and

1478
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:34,400
people within government and social

1479
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:37,599
media companies and civil society in

1480
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,599
order to be pushing back against some of

1481
00:56:39,599 --> 00:56:42,000
these laws so that um social media

1482
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,799
companies in the end aren't just then i

1483
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:46,880
think the alternative scenario is that

1484
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:49,119
we might live in a world where

1485
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,359
um basically

1486
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,200
international social media companies are

1487
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,000
blocked in almost every country and

1488
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,799
instead each country has its own local

1489
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:00,960
social media company that instead

1490
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:03,680
complies very much more closely with the

1491
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:06,079
local government

1492
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:07,839
yes i think that seems to be happening

1493
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,760
in some other places and turkey is also

1494
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,359
attempting so i want to go back to

1495
00:57:11,359 --> 00:57:13,040
zellard with that other question because

1496
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:15,040
i'm also not sure and this is something

1497
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,040
i can we can discuss do people in turkey

1498
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:19,680
care about these restrictions

1499
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:21,119
what do you think

1500
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:21,920
yes

1501
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:24,240
um

1502
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,000
actually uh

1503
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,920
i think

1504
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:30,880
the internet taxes is uh

1505
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,000
has an important role especially in

1506
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,880
these times in turkey after the sedate

1507
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,160
picker

1508
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,119
videos

1509
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,720
which is a mafia leader

1510
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,960
exposing the illegal actions of the

1511
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,240
government

1512
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,200
and

1513
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,520
after the sharing

1514
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,280
his videos became a popular figure in

1515
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,920
turkey this is just not about

1516
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:01,920
his

1517
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,040
words or his personality

1518
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:07,680
this is also about to get information

1519
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,240
about the government's actions

1520
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,760
and then

1521
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:12,720
i think

1522
00:58:12,720 --> 00:58:15,839
besides of the security cameras internet

1523
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,440
restrictions

1524
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:18,559
or

1525
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,839
access plan decisions we forgot

1526
00:58:20,839 --> 00:58:23,599
something uh because

1527
00:58:23,599 --> 00:58:25,440
social media

1528
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,280
and freedom of the internet is not only

1529
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,880
important for the following the needs

1530
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,839
or

1531
00:58:34,839 --> 00:58:37,440
um anything yes

1532
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,119
because of course it's also very

1533
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:41,680
important for socializing or get

1534
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:45,599
connected especially in covet times

1535
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:48,079
because of that people

1536
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:50,799
really care about the internet freedoms

1537
00:58:50,799 --> 00:58:51,920
and

1538
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:54,960
any restriction against these freedoms

1539
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:55,760
yeah

1540
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,480
well

1541
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,160
yes maybe there's a tiny bit of

1542
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:00,000
difference in uh in terms of users in

1543
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,240
turkey and russia and especially of this

1544
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,319
uh this mafia leader that uh you know

1545
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,559
we're a proud moment for turkey where we

1546
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:09,040
have you know given the world this uh

1547
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,760
term deep state uh and uh

1548
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,000
and now it's ex-members are talking

1549
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,680
about the government and uh he became a

1550
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:17,760
phenomenon millions of

1551
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,760
youtube videos like the single videos

1552
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,760
they watched uh three million times it

1553
00:59:21,760 --> 00:59:24,160
was in the first 10 minutes so

1554
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,400
so yes it's crazy and it's uh and he

1555
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:27,920
always addresses young dinner he always

1556
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,079
says i'm talking to people under 40.

1557
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:31,440

1558
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:33,440
murderous uh

1559
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,920
i don't know uh mafia leader but uh so

1560
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:37,520
