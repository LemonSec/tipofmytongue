by now so i'm going to mix it up a

20

i'm also going to show you a music video

24
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
that i've been working on

25
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,440
and actually let you sit in while i

26
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,079
record

27
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,480
on a new song so i'm gonna try and keep

28
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,239
it moving keep it interesting

29
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,680
and i am gonna play a song to kick us

30
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,160
off

31
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,640
off of my new album spotify is

32
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,800
surveillance which is out now on get

33
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,039
better records and don giovanni records

34
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,399
i'll talk a little bit more about that

35
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,399
title and why i named it that and the

36
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,159
campaign associated with it in just a

37
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,640
minute

38
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,760
but first here's a song about missing

39
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,240
being together in person it's obviously

40
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:12,320
i wish that we were hanging out

41
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,360
in a room instead of me kind of coming

42
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,880
to you through the screen here

43
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,880
so if you miss live music you miss

44
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,960
parties you miss gatherings

45
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,040
and you feel sad about it i promise you

46
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,799
this song will make you miss them even

47
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,130
more and feel even sadder about it

sorry

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,840
do you remember when

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,919
basements felt like stadiums

00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,879
under the glow of christmas lights

00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,480

nights of our lives and

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,280
i regret every single show

57
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,519
that i spent in the back row

58
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,480
talking on my phone behind

59
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,160
a table all alone

60
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,400
every party that i skipped

61
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
every friend i lost touch

there were nights when toxic masculinity

couldn't even ruin the mosh pit

screaming every word

feeling seen and being heard

we were outcasts we were freaks

we were idealists we believed

when the band played our favorite songs

00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,320
it felt like we belongs

it felt like

thanks that's my song background off my

85
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,360
new album spotify is surveillance

86
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,120
so let's talk about that album title why

87
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,720
did i call it that so

88
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
i originally wanted to simply draw

89
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,080
attention to the fact that spotify as

90
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,400
a dominant streaming service really

91
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,759
employs the same

92
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,000
surveillance capitalist business model

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,360
of companies like

94
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,919
facebook and youtube where their profit

95
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:20,960
is derived from

96
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
harvesting our data and using it to

97
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,360
manipulate us in the case of spotify

98
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,680
they're uh harvesting a tremendous

99
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,720
amount of data about

100
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
obviously the music that we listen to

101
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
and from that they're inferring all

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,160
kinds of

103
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,759
things and really conducting what i

104
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,199
would argue as a form of

105
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,520
emotional surveillance in terms of

106
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,440
listening to the tempo of the music

107
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,479
we're listening to

108
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
the layers of it what it sounds like the

109
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,600
feel of it

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,680
and then using that to algorithmically

111
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,639
recommend

112
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,199
music to us that they think we want to

113
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,400
hear um

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,199
and i i titled the album spotify

115
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,520
surveillance and then spotify really

116
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
seems like they were just trying to

117
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,560
prove my point because they

118
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,680
came out with a patent to use artificial

119
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
intelligence-powered voice recognition

120
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,600
software i'm not making this up

121
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,120
to literally listen to your

122
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:11,039
conversations and

123
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
use your biometric uh voice data to

124
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
infer things about you they claim to be

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,199
able to infer for example

126
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,199
your gender based on your voice which is

127
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:20,800
hugely problematic

128
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,280
for trans folks and non-binary folks and

129
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,720
a lot of other people

130
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,560
they also claim to be able to recommend

131
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
music to you based on your accent which

132
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,319
is profoundly racist

133
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:32,160
and the whole scheme would have been

134
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:33,600
just incredibly invasive

135
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,080
fortunately our good friends at access

136
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,600

as my organization fight for the future

and dozens of artists and musicians

00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,199
including tom morello the guitarist of

00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:46,720
and laura jane grace from against me and

142
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,000
so many others um

143
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,479
put out a letter and have been running a

144
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:51,440
campaign

145
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,080
um calling out this patent spotify has

146
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,479
since

147
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
said that they're not planning to use it

148
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,440
but we're still pushing to get a

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,400
commitment from them

150
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,080
that they're never going to implement

151
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,680
this type of invasive

152
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,919
voice recognition surveillance as part

153
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:04,880
of their application

154
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,599
so um to kick off that campaign that

155
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,840
original stop spotifysurveillance.org

156
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,039
campaign that fight for the future

157
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,599
launched

158
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,080
i released a music video for a song off

159
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,199
of my album called

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,599

161
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:18,479
relevant to

162
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:20,720
uh rights come on in this event um and

163
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,240
instead of playing it for you

164
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:23,520
i'm actually going to show you that

165
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,360
music video that i produced

166
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,599
with a fantastic video creator named

michael flowers

168
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,720

something and doing something

about it we assume that there should be

a prison system

00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,640
there should be a surveillance i think

00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,240
that these assumptions need to be

219
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
simply inserting digital technologies

into discriminatory policies without

221
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,120
adjusting

its fundamental flaws can only serve to

223
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
supersize that discrimination

224
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,160
can only serve to reduce community

225
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,640

else

229
00:10:48,399 --> 00:11:01,839
can happen

230
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,399
so that was my song surveillance

231
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480

by michael flowers

233
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
i want to shout out some of the folks

234
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,519
that i sampled there that intro audio

235
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:14,000
clip is

236
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,640
of course from ursula k le guin and then

237
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,480
we had some digital rights celebrities

238
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
on the track um give it up for jacinta

239
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,480
gonzalez of migente who was uh

240
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,360
sampled there as well as malkia cyril uh

241
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,680
formerly of media justice and a hero of

242
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,360
mine and i'm sure many of yours

243
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,800
um who was the outro there as well so um

244
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,000
it's been really fun for me to be able

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
to play with um clipping audio and using

246
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:36,880
that

247
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,360
in music and recordings as a way to kind

248
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,200
of convey a point that maybe

249
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,519
i couldn't quite get to rhyme so i hope

250
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,399
you enjoyed that

251
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,839
i'm gonna play another song for you all

252
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,680
this is called the tyranny of

253
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:50,399
either or and it's a bit of an anthem

254
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,560
for trans and non-binary folks

255
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
and i i'm gonna sing it for y'all now in

00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,320

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,279
which i'm not going to show you now

262
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,040
um is really about kind of getting back

263
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,720
in touch with the revolutionary

264
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,360
radical roots of the modern day pride

265
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,000
movement

266
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,839
um it kicks off with an audio clip from

267
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:15,040
sylvia rivera

268
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,279
uh trans women of color who got up on

269
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,120
stage at christopher street liberation

270
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,000

271
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,079
one of the predecessors to modern day

272
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,680
pride parades and essentially

273
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,680
excruciated the mainstream gay rights

274
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,240
movement

275
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,760
for failing to fight for the most

276
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,440
vulnerable members of our community

277
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,360
particularly trans folks people of color

278
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,560
sex workers uh

279
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,839
and folks without homes um so i i

280
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,680
channel sylvia in this song and it's a

281
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
bit of an open letter to turfs and other

282
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:40,720
transphobes

283
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:53,839

okay hey what's up i am back i'm going

324
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,519
to do something a little bit different

325
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:39,120
for y'all now i'm going to actually show

326
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,199
you a little bit of my process for

327
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:44,480
how i record music at home which has

328
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,759
been really important for me as an

329
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:46,880
activist

330
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,120
because i don't have a ton of time to go

331
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,800
into a fancy studio and i don't have a

332
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,560
ton of money for it either

333
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,040
and since my music is now not my full

334
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:55,839
source of income

335
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:58,399
it's been really empowering to be able

336
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,639
to kind of just make music at home so

337
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:02,800
i recorded my entire album spotify

338
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,920
surveillance on

339
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,959
my laptop using garageband which is

340
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,079
free software that comes on most

341
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,279
macbooks and um it's you know pretty

342
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:13,839
simple

343
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,320
and i had basically no experience

344
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,920
recording myself before getting into

345
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:18,800
this

346
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,399
but i kind of just learned as i went and

347
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,440
i'm going to show you all a little bit

348
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,000
of the process

349
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,600
of how i do that by actually showing you

350
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,040
a new song that i'm working on

351
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,399
and i'm going to let you kind of watch

352
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,320
me record the bass for it so let's do

353
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:28,720
that

354
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,639
all right okay okay so i'm going to show

355
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,240
you a little bit about my process here

356
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:32,959
for how i

357
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:35,920
record so this is garageband it's like i

358
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:36,240
said

359
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:38,399
free software that comes uh on a lot of

360
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,759
computers and

361
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:42,480
um i recorded my entire album in this so

362
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,759
um you know if you're out there and you

363
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,360
like like making music um

364
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,880
keep in mind that you don't necessarily

365
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:49,120
need a whole lot to make stuff that can

366
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,560
sound pretty good these days

367
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,759
um so you can see i've got kind of a

368
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,440
bunch of layers here and anybody who's

369
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,040
kind of recorded before is familiar with

370
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,000
that so i've got

371
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,600
drums here up at the top i've got bass

372
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,199
which is actually just scratch i'm going

373
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
to delete this now because

374
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,520
i'm going to record some bass with you

375
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,000
all

376
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,199
and kind of show you what that looks

377
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:10,880
like i've got a couple layers of

378
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,400
acoustic guitars you can see they're all

379
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,160
muted right now because i'm not using

380
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,039
them

381
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,400
i've got a few different layers of

382
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,240
vocals you can see the vocals have some

383
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,679
effects on them i've got one with kind

384
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,679
of a megaphone effect one

385
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,599
with just like a straight narration and

386
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,359
then a high harmony which has some

387
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:28,880
compression on it and some reverb

388
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,880
and i've got a bunch more layers of

389
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:32,320
vocals for this second

390
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,080
section of the song with a harmony and

391
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,600
things like that um

392
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,840
then i've got a bunch of guitars uh i've

393
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,440
got one guitar with kind of a delay

394
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,440
effect on it i've got one guitar with

395
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,039
some distortion on it classic

396
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,440
punk rock feel and then one guitar with

397
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,600
this stadium spread effect which is sort

398
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,400
of like very

399
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,840
u2 reverb distortion kind of vibe

400
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,360
and then i have an echo guitar that you

401
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:54,799
can see is also muted because i'm still

402
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,160
working on that one

403
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
but basically what i do is i always

404
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
start with one of these drum tracks

405
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:03,280
and i do play some live drums on the

406
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,440
album but most of it is actually just

407
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,200
this um garageband default um ai drums

408
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,120
this is maybe one of the only the few

409
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,960
good uses of ai

410
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,280
out there is um these kind of ai

411
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,960
drummers and basically they have real

412
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
drummers that they recorded and

413
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
you can kind of drag and drop around

414
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,240
here to select um you know whether you

415
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:22,960
want to

416
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:26,000
emphasize the symbols or the toms or

417
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,120
different parts of the drums you can

418
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,280
adjust like where the fills are

419
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,919
usually if i want to accent that i will

420
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:33,120
use

421
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
i'll just create another drum track that

422
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,520
i control with a midi keyboard so i can

423
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,440
like add a symbol here or like make a

424
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,039
fill sound exactly the way i want it to

425
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:41,760
sound

426
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,840
but that's actually how i do most of my

427
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:44,799
drums

428
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:48,160
these days is using these pre-programmed

429
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,679
drums and then kind of just

430
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,320
adjusting them as i see fit but as you

431
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,080
can see the song currently has no bass

432
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:54,720
on it

433
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,720
so i'm gonna record the bass right now

434
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,160
and let you all watch and

435
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,320
um and as you do you can see the song

436
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,200
and hear the song

437
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,600
um this song is called pink washing and

438
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
i'm trying to get it out this month for

439
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:05,840
pride

440
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,799
um it's about the ways that

441
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,520
authoritarian governments

442
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,799
around the world have often weaponized

443
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,960
discussions around depression of lgbtq

444
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,480
folks to justify

445
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,840
militarism to justify colonization to

446
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:20,480
justify

447
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,720
imperialism and we've seen that of

448
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,679
course

449
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,000
over the last few weeks with the renewed

450
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,360
violent state attacks

451
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,679
on uh palestinians and the people of

452
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:30,400
gaza

453
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:32,559
where um those who are justifying or

454
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,919
defending those attacks

455
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:36,640
are often pointing to things like the

456
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,520
presence of lgbtq people in the israeli

457
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,400
military

458
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,640
as if that uh somehow justifies these

459
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,919
human rights violations

460
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
uh when of course it doesn't um so this

461
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,320
song speaks a bit to that and to that

462
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,160
trend uh from the u.s government and

463
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,480
many other governments around the world

464
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,880
and it is called pink washing and i will

465
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,559
just as a content warning say that it

466
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,280
does have

467
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,600
reclaimed transphobic and homophobic

468
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,880
slurs in it so

469
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,120
just be aware of that all right let's

470
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:07,530
play some bass

471
00:20:07,530 --> 00:20:18,460

all right i know that the wait has been

491
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,159
very very difficult for you all but

492
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,000
finally here is the banjo

493
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,640
i know you were waiting for it um but

494
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,400
i'm gonna sing um

495
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,919
an old labor song actually not a

496
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,679
particularly old labor song one that i

497
00:22:57,679 --> 00:22:58,320
wrote um

498
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,120
maybe 15 years ago or so um that i used

499
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,880
to sing with my dear friend ann feeney

500
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:03,919
who passed away

501
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,039
from kovid um a number of months ago

502
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:09,039
go look up her obituary she was an

503
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,159
incredible uh

504
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:12,320
activist and musician and a huge

505
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:13,600
inspiration to me

506
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:16,000
um but i'm going to sing this song

507
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,440
because i think there's been a huge

508
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,159
awakening

509
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:21,440
as we've seen among workers at tech

510
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,000
companies

511
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,640
around the world and we've seen how

512
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:27,039
employees and workers coming together

513
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:29,120
can not only improve their own working

514
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,280
conditions but where we've seen workers

515
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:34,320
standing in solidarity fighting to

516
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:34,880
ensure

517
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,720
that the technology that they're making

518
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,400
is not being used to violate human

519
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,120
rights we saw

520
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,120
employees at microsoft and amazon

521
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
pushing back on their contracts with law

522
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,279
enforcement and military agencies

523
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:46,159
pushing back

524
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:48,400
on their uh selling and development of

525
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,919
facial recognition and other types of

526
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,760
surveillance technologies

527
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,600
and that solidarity is powerful and

528
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,279
important so

529
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,120
here's a little song about solidarity

530
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,400
that i wrote and it's called

531
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,960
the picket line song

532
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:19,520

537
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,240
heart and hope to die

538

if i should ever walk across a picket

539
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,840

541
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,200
right or what was wrong

542
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:45,440
never taught me to play banjo never

543
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,520
taught me to write songs

544
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,360
one thing that she taught me all

545
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,360
remember for all time

546
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,279

two pieces of her mind

that she could find

592
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:38,559

686
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:01,280
there's not much to say

687
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,799
[Music]

688
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:05,730
so we shelter in place

689
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,279
[Music]

690
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:11,039
love has survived

691
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,880
through hard times before

692
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:18,880
when i think of the things

693
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:23,279
our love has endured

694
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:28,300
willing to wait

695
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:37,789
[Music]

696
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:43,600
no matter how long it takes

697
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,519
i'm willing to wait

698
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,960
i'm willing to wait

699
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:55,360
[Music]

700
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,199
we take walks together

701
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:01,100
stand six feet apart

702
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:03,519
[Music]

703
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:07,600
when i cry i can't hold you

704
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,960
and it breaks my heart

705
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,519
[Music]

706
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:15,200
it's hard to hold on to

707
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,600
all the things we had planned

708
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,240
i say i can't do this

709
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,279
that i can

710
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,960
it's over we'll gather

711
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:35,200
with friends and metamorphs

712
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:39,600
i can't sleep i write songs

713
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:43,439
stretch metaphors

714
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,279
willing to wait

715
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:51,279
willing to wait

716
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:02,480
no matter how long it takes

717
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,840
willing to wait

718
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:14,399
[Music]

719
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:18,239
our love is encrypted

720
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:22,639
messages disappear you signal

721
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:26,079
photos and texts

722
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,599
longing and fear

723
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:33,520
this is all over

724
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,440
i will throw a huge show

725
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,520
and i will invite you

726
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:45,280
and i hope you will go

727
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,520
we will make love

728
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:53,199
for nights upon days

729
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:57,599
we make up for lost time

730
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,359
so many ways

731
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:04,720
willing to wait

732
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,200
willing to wait

733
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,960
willing to wait

734
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:17,119
willing to wait

735
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,480
how long it takes

736
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:24,720
willing to wait

737
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:31,200
i'm willing to wait

738
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,319
