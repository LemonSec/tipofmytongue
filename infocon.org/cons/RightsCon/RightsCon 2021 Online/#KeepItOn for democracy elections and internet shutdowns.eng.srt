14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,359
um

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,320
the internet and elections or actually

16
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:34,559
the lack of internet during elections

17
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:35,280
which

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,920
unfortunately seemed to seem to become a

19
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,800
trend

20
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,239
so i'm here today with

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,920
my colleague felicia antonio

22
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,440
who is the lead uh who is coordinating

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,360
the keep it on campaign

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,719
a lot of you have maybe uh have uh

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,199
have heard her via the kill switch

26
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,000
podcasts

27
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,239
which we will be uh linking as part of

28
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:02,399
the resources that are available

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,119
um and then of course we have great

30
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,000
speakers

31
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,240
today who will be available to answer

32
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,840
questions and they will be introducing

33
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,360
themselves and

34
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,479
say a couple of remarks in a minute

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,439
but just as we're starting i wanted to

36
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:18,640
put a bit of context

37
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,320
into the reason why we're having this

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,840
press briefing because

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,200
at some point i was having a bit of a

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,880
deja vu and

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,080
um last year we had another press

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,880
briefing

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,439
also on internets shutdowns and

44
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:32,240
elections

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,439
and unfortunately the reason why we have

46
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:36,640
another one

47
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,560
this year with a similar uh

48
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,600
theme is because what was last year

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
let's say like the premises and the

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:46,720
beginning trend

51
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,920
is turning into a real concern that we

52
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,280
have for democracy

53
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,479
we've been able to identify new patterns

54
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,640
uh when it comes to internet shutdowns

55
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,600
and election

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
and by internet shutdowns we refer to

57
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,680
like complete internet blackouts or kill

58
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,040
switch which is when

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,439
governments completely pull the plug and

60
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,239
disconnect

61
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,440
the country but also to um when

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,840
platforms of being censored especially

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
communications platform and information

64
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,000
sharing platforms such as twitter

65
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,360
facebook

66
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,800
messaging platforms like whatsapp signal

67
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,560
or facebook messenger and so on so um

68
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,200
the the trends are moving the the

69
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,080
environment

70
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,560
is really moving when it comes to

71
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,080
elections and shutdown

72
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
this year we counted 50 incidents of uh

73
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,080
internet disruption since the bits since

74
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,160
the beginning of the year so in the past

75
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,879
five six months really and a few of them

76
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,599
of course

77
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,920
uh occurred during elections that was

78
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,599
the case in uganda

79
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,720
we heard about congo

80
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,120
so they were it is a it is a concern

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,840
and so i really want to make sure that

82
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,360
we have the space

83
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
to discuss um many concerns but also

84
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:06,959
challenges and if we have them

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
solutions uh if you have specific

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,879
questions for

87
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,599
our speakers uh they will present

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,280
themselves and you will know exactly

89
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:15,680
their

90
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,840
area of expertise as we have a few

91
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:18,959
elections coming up

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,319
so it will be really relevant to hear

93
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,000
from them and to also feel

94
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,120
prepared we actually launched

95
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
a handbook on elections and shutdown

96
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,400
destined specifically for reporters

97
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,920
uh covering elections and for um

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,840
elections monitors so that's another

99
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,440
resource that we'll be

100
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,560
sharing with you all and i think that's

101
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,239
it in terms of housekeeping

102
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,440
uh this press conference is recorded

103
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,480
so you know like uh although we're not

104
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,159
all in a room but just consider that

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:54,640
it's re

106
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,280
it's recorded and uh the the question

107
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,400
and the answers

108
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,519
will be publicly available afterwards

109
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,920
so if there is something maybe like

110
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
sensitive that you would not want

111
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:09,439
uh to be shared publicly uh please

112
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,480
be mindful that this is recorded and

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,159
that there are other opportunities to

114
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,040
also

115
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,519

off

197
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,639
uh so that i can leverage the bandwidth

198
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
uh because i'm

199
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,039
out of town you know in zambia the fact

200
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
that you move away from the

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,440
capital city the the quality of internet

202
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,199
also deteriorates

203
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,800
so to avoid that disruption uh i will

204
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:53,280
beg that maybe i can just um

205
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,160
speak without the camera actually i had

206
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,120
to drive a few uh kilometers

207
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,759
to access the network i'm actually doing

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,560

209
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,479
from from the car that we are using you

210
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000

212
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,360

213

uh my name is mulanga richard i'm the

214
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,360
team leader at

215
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,960
bloggers of zambia we are a

216
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:20,560
growing enterprise in zambia our work is

217
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,680
primarily focused on three pillars

218
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,120
internet governance and digital rights

219
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,000
media rights and freedoms and then

220
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,199
online

221
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,440
creative content and platform management

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,640
so

223
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,880
do our work through campaigning advocacy

224
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,200
trainings and just everything that just

225
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
influences

226
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,800
law and policy everything that draws

227
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,160
attention to

228
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,440
what we think must be done about uh

229
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,360
making the internet accessible you know

230
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,880
affordable and

231
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
to keep it on to keep the the internet

232
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,519
on during all this time um

233
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:03,040
example we haven't had uh

234
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,160
an internet shutdown we shall say we

235
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:07,440
usually put the word yet

236
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,800
at the end because we are going towards

237
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,480
an election

238
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,320
and the internet in zambia has become

239
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,320
a very special area of interest by the

240
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,440
state

241
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,160
so they are weaponizing the narrative

242
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:23,200
that

243
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,920
zambians are abusing social media

244
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,160
platforms like facebook and twitter

245
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,480
where they are insulting and criticizing

246
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,320
government leaders

247
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,600
and so they have come up with a cyber

248
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:38,399
security and cyber crimes act that has

249
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:39,040
got

250
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,800
several provisions that are parallel to

251
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
the constitution

252
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,360
and other subsidiary laws like article

253
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,000
18 of the constitution that guarantees

254
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,800
and protects freedom of expression and

255
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,800
article 17 of the constitution that

256
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,160
guarantees and protects the right to

257
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,440
to assembly so there are also public

258
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
order laws

259
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,120
like the public order act the ngo act

260
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,560
that are used you know in the physical

261
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,839
space to

262
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,920
just tie for people's assembly and all

263
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,079
that so as we go towards an election

264
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,480
we expect the cyber security and cyber

265
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
crimes act actually to be used

266
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,360
to shut down the internet

267
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
because we have seen examples are used

268
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,600
like uganda zimbabwe

269
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,040
and look what is happening there so

270
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,800
sometimes you think it is

271
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
to maintain public order and hygiene and

272
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,720
it's better to switch off the internet

273
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,959
so it's shut down but in the past we

274
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:31,839
have had um

275
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,839
like internet uh uh jamming filtering

276
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,000
and website blockages like we have the

277
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,600
xamarin watchdog that's really great for

278
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,800
the government so

279
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,320
we wouldn't accept the access the

280
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,800
website because our service providers

281
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,640
have been asked to

282
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,920
to what to do to block the access

283
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,040
so that is that is um the the synopsis

284
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,519
where we are and i will just pass the

285
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,640

censorship large enquiries we were

333
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,440
in internet access costs due to

334
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,480
over retest

regarding

359
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,760
censorship and human rights and

360
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,760

but right now i'm working keep it on um

365
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,560
on shutdowns and internet disruptions

366
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,399
and it is a very

367
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,040
important year for us in latin america

368
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,560
because we have elections

369
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,839
all across the region

370
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:53,600
venezuela itself has

371
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:56,639
mega elections at the end of the of the

372
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:57,360
year

373
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,199
is what we call mega elections means

374
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:01,040
that we

375
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:03,519
get to choose i can't vote but we get to

376
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,160
choose

377
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,600
um different stages of

378
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,199
government chile relief has

379
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:14,399
two lf big elections this year

380
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,040
and we also have elections in nicaragua

381
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,639
we just have peru

382
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:22,160
um honduras and the different

383
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:25,519
kind of democracies across the region

384
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:28,199
make it um very different in the

385
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:29,440
circumstances

386
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,880
of the uh a blockbuster and a general

387
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,399
internet blackout

388
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:38,320
of or or internet censorship of certain

389
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,800
size

390
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,759
can occur so it's very different for

391
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:42,480
instance

392
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,240
what might happen right now in colombia

393
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,600
with the protest

394
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,399
or to what can happen in chile or in

395
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,759
uruguay

396
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,320
and so we need to be very very aware

397
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,040
about what

398
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,600
a main trend that i would like to

399
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,040
highlight

400
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,480
is the the use

401
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,320
of inter infrastructural failure

402
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,680
to disconnect regions entire regions or

403
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,120
towns or cities

404
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,360
or even the whole country that has

405
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,320
happened

406
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,360
in cuba a few times

407
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,920
which is extremely hard to track

408
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:20,959
extremely hard to

409
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,320
attribute and for us is

410
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,199
a really big challenge that we need to

411
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,040
be aware that it's going to be happening

412
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,959
more and more in the coming

413
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:37,839
year or so

414
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:41,040

in latin america um before we dive into

418

so please take note all right i'm

435
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:27,520
handing over to melody to kickstart

436
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:29,720
sure so as you saw we've got

437
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:31,039
representation

438
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:34,000
from various regions various continents

439
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,919
around the world because

440
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,320
one of the conclusions that we were

441
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,480
already able to draw

442
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,640
after a few years of doing this

443
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,799
campaigning and doing research related

444
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:45,280
to

445
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,559
the keep it on campaign is that no one

446
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:51,840
is no one is excluded

447
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,960
to be fair unfortunately

448
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,440
every region has been concerned by

449
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
internet showdowns during election

450
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,880
and so a first question that is quite

451
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,440
broad and general but to keep us started

452
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,400
and maybe to put

453
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:09,600
everyone on um to give like background

454
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,600
context to everyone is that

455
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,200
we've noticed that governments

456
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,760
have used uh international dance in a

457
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,600
way or another whether it's

458
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
as we said like a total shutdowns or

459
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,640
just like a

460
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,320
a targeted one or the targeting of

461
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,400
specific platforms

462
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,120
they've been doing this just before

463
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,080
during

464
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,880
and or after elections so to all of our

465
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
speakers my question is

466
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
why do you think that government

467
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
governments are so quick

468
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
to hit the kill switch during these

469
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,679
important national events

470
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:44,240
what are they afraid of what reason did

471
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,360
they give

472
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,520
how how did they match reality

473
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,880
okay richard go ahead so

474
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:03,760
in our case um our from our experience

475
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,440
why the internet remains targeted

476
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,200
uh is because the our government would

477
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,280
like to

478
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,480
control our freedom

479
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,520
they would like to control

480
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,880
our our freedom of expression

481
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,760
uh assembly and association on the

482
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,880
internet

483
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,360
that we should be limited in what we can

484
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,760
do with the internet with regard to

485
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,799
speaking truth to power um

486
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:36,840
ensuring that this transparency and

487
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,520
accountability you scrutinize those that

488
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,880
are in leadership

489
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,919
who scrutinize those that want to

490
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,400
that are vying for political office

491
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,720
because

492
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,720
people use the traditional media but it

493
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,000
is so gagged

494
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,720
and the censorship and certain critical

495
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,760
voices actually

496
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
the civil society and journalists the

497
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,760
radio stations here

498
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,640
are closed without reason journalists

499
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,400
are beaten when they

500
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,080
write critical pieces some media houses

501
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
actually attacked on

502
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
live phone ins because of what they said

503
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,120
or who they are hosting

504
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,640
for as a result everyone is going to the

505
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,600
internet that is open and inclusive and

506
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,400
participatory and so the government

507
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,000
doesn't like that

508
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
that people should be free to just

509
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,799
you know participate in the democracy so

510
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
you see freedom of expression is the

511
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,880
engine of democracy in our view that

512
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,880
without a freedom of expression

513
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,720
democrats cannot function

514
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,720
without participation and inclusion

515
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,480
democracy is dead

516
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,880
so our democracy is actually dying

517
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,360
because

518
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,840
the government doesn't want people to to

519
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,440
speak people to

520
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,440
offer their opinions and ideas so the

521
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,520
internet is at the center of this and we

522
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,960
are going into an election in

523
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,159
in less than 50 days and

524
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,000
the inspector general police the

525
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,159
ministers and just anyone who has access

526
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,039
to

527
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:04,960
the national broadcaster they are

528
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,240
threatening people

529
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:08,880
who are abusing social media now we have

530
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,679
taken time to study what they're calling

531
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,679
abuse of social media these are just

532
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:14,960
critical voices that

533
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,679
are that are critical of the government

534
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,600
the president his wife

535
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,760
and just all the wrong that is going on

536
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,360
so they don't like it and they're

537
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,600
calling it upbeat of social media that

538
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,600
zambians are insulting the president

539
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,720
that his wife

540
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,159
and the the ministers so um the internet

541
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,440
is a bad thing

542
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,600
uh it must be regulated it must be

543
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,039
controlled and the

544
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,440
uh everyone who puts bad content like

545
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,880
insulting the president

546
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,240
must be arrested and the in the

547
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,120
the law that i i talked about earlier on

548
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,760
the penalties are unrealistic they are

549
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,200
they are unjustifiable they are harsh

550
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,840
they are they are too hard to compre

551
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
comprehend

552
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,360
just for people who are exercising their

553
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,039
right to freedom of expression on the

554
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:02,000
internet

555
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,039
so that is our story

556
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:10,400
may i add something from a perspective

557
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
to this good question

558
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,679
um it's very clearly like the first

559
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,799
factor that um has a way

560
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,919
in that is that governments want to

561
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:23,600
restrict freedom of information because

562
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,799
they don't want to um

563
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,320
they don't want information about police

564
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,159
abuse to get out

565
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:33,360
that's the first line basically

566
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:35,919
but a second thing that i think we need

567
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,520
to consider

568
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,039
is that centralization in latin america

569
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:44,960
is a thing an actual thing

570
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:48,480
there is one isp in most countries

571
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,600
that holds 60 percent of

572
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,840
[Music]

573
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:56,320
traffic and is often controlled by

574
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,280
government

575
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,799
it's public and so it's very easy

576
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:03,919
to use a kill switch in that provider

577
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,360
using that provider

578
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,559
and radically reduce the capability of

579
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,400
people to access the internet

580
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,080
and that that seems very not close like

581
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,240
it's okay this is something that we do

582
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,080
in order for more people to be able to

583
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:19,840
access the internet because

584
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,039
um infrastructure is is expensive

585
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,480
and then governments need to get take

586
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
care of that but then

587
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
it becomes very dangerous because it's

588
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,400
very easy for them to do that without

589
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
any kind of procedure

590
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,440
and this is something that repeats

591
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:35,520
across the region

592
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,799
and it is uh

593
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,799
very difficult to handle because it also

594
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:43,440
means that there is no transparency at

595
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,080
all

596
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,559
when the shutdowns happen there is no

597
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,840
explanation

598
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,840
it's very difficult to run technical

599
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,520
tests in order to find out what's

600
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,400
happening

601
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:57,279
and it is it is a original thing

602
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,840
may i add uh one more point

603
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,960
so i i i think i just

604
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,159
i i totally agree with uh uh things that

605
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,240
uh my colleagues and friends they they

606
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,279
said and

607
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,919
um my experience is one of the reasons

608
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,400
that they

609
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,480
shut down the internet is because simply

610
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,320
they don't they want to shut down the

611
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,440
communication

612
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,360
they don't want people to talk to each

613
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
other to mobilize

614
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,880
and you know basically to act against

615
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,720
whatever is the will of the the

616
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,240
government and the state

617
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,880
uh and and now now these days they

618
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,880
shutting down the internet but

619
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,279
before the internet were really popular

620
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,000
and you know

621
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
uh everyone in iran had access to the

622
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,039
internet back in uh

623
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,679
2009 the the time that the stila was in

624
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:44,640
iran

625
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,360
that we saw a really widespread a

626
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,880
national white protest

627
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,880
after the i would say that was the first

628
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,720
widespread process after the revolution

629
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,840
in iran

630
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,000
they the internet was like we had the

631
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,760
main connection was dial-up so it was

632
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,799
not like really

633
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,960
and they were not really 3g and 4g back

634
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,159
then in iran

635
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,960
uh so what what they did was shutting

636
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,159
down the mobile phone

637
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,120
and and text messages so you see that

638
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,000
that we are

639
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,080
seeing this trend is shifting to the

640
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,200
internet because

641
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
now internet is the main tools of

642
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,279
communication

643
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,679
between all of the activists and all the

644
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:20,480
people

645
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,360
uh who wants to protect their rights so

646
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,159
uh

647
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,799
so shouting down the communication with

648
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,400
activists and people

649
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,720
is one of the main goal and of course

650
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,840
they can have

651
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,919
the because they have the estate media

652
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,840
they can have their own narrative

653
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,000
publishing their own narrative about

654
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,720
what is going on and why uh why people

655
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,840
are protesting

656
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,520
i actually have a follow-up question i'm

657
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,039
here about what you just said in terms

658
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:51,679
of

659
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:55,120
cutting access to communications because

660
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,720
in the past and actually it's also

661
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,279
related to what you said marianne about

662
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,080
um centralization of internet service

663
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,200
providers

664
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,120
we know that in a in a number of

665
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,520
countries there is also a centralization

666
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,559
of the media some of which also is

667
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,400
controlled by government and so

668
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,200
i'd like to draw this parallel between

669
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,279
you know like when governments were able

670
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,159
to control

671
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,720
and influence the media in that case the

672
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,320
censorship or the

673
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,559
the control over the content was maybe a

674
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,000
bit more pernicious

675
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,679
as opposed to what we're seeing now

676
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,080
which is when governments decide to

677
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,279
censor the internet uh not just via

678
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:34,799
removing some websites here and there

679
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,600
but really shutting down the internet or

680
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,360
shutting down part of the internet or

681
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,360
part of the internet services

682
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,880
what can you say like what do you think

683
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,440
it says about this new trend which

684
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,600
or or is it different is it the same

685
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,440
thing because it feels the perception

686
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:50,960
feels different when you just

687
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:52,880
don't have access it's different to have

688
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,039
access to something that has been

689
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,799
you know like tempered with or or or

690
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,559
or control so yeah that was my question

691
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:01,919
to you in terms of

692
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:04,559
the differences and and um what do you

693
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:05,039
think

694
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
that means as as a threat maybe or as

695
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,880
not so much of a threat to to democracy

696
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,919
and the electoral process

697
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:16,159
sure that's that's a very good question

698
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:17,600
um i mean

699
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,200
in a country like iran the the state

700
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,360
media radio and tv they are

701
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,159
absolutely under control of the the

702
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,000
government and by the government i don't

703
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:28,720
mean

704
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,880
uh the the administration and

705
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:33,039
presidential office i mean the office of

706
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,399
the supreme leader

707
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,960
so it's like a level higher than a

708
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,399
regular uh

709
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,600
uh government that we talked about in in

710
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,640
uh countries it's basically like kind of

711
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,440
having king and then like like another

712
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,559
position

713
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:52,080
so so they they want to have absolute

714
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:53,600
control over the

715
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,399
or everything that people are are here

716
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:57,039
list

717
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:00,000
hearing or watching uh and this is not

718
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,919
just about the news it's about like a

719
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:02,559
culture

720
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,279
movie uh you know about like like

721
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,640
blocking netflix

722
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,720
uh obviously blocking it releases both

723
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,480
sides because of the text sanctions as

724
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,039
well

725
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:14,320
but but blocking like uh watching a live

726
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:14,799
stream

727
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,000
video and you know news everything but

728
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,240
something that is completing uh

729
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,360
basically

730
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:24,399
this puzzle in iran is the

731
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:26,559
the local infrastructure of the internet

732
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:28,720
the localization of the internet

733
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,240
so the goal uh in iran is

734
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,880
to tell people to sell this idea to the

735
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:35,679
to the

736
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:38,399
to people that you don't need to access

737
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:38,960
to the

738
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,480
uh internet or what they call it

739
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,120
international internet you don't need to

740
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,799
have access to that you don't need to

741
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,640
have access to

742
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,640
anything outside the country we are

743
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:51,919
going to provide

744
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,039
whatever you need inside iran

745
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:57,200
and in order to sell that idea to the

746
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,799
people they are even

747
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,200
subsidize the internet traffic in iran

748
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,000
if you see

749
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,559
the if you use the local services in

750
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,480
iran you're paying half a price than

751
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,559
using the international services

752
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:11,120
so that's include all the news media all

753
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,960
the news website all the

754
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,559
uh broadcasting inside the country

755
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:19,200
as well as communication tools messaging

756
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:19,679
apps

757
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,799
email services and and everything so

758
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:26,159
so the the the final goal is to keep

759
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,240
everything ins and right now 70

760
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,880
of internet traffic is local traffic

761
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,240
inside the country

762
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:35,679
so we are not really far from uh

763
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,600
being totally cut off from the rest of

764
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,039
the world so

765
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:41,600
that's that's the main goal localization

766
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,760
and selling the idea to the people that

767
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:45,840
whatever you need news communication

768
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,000
whatever you need is inside the country

769
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,159
and forget about the outside

770
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,120
can you compete uh

771
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,039
uh i don't yeah we can hear you

772
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,799
okay uh just to complete uh

773
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,679
i mean talking the reason often given to

774
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,440
justifying

775
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,720
a shutdown is uh to fight against the

776
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,559
spirit of fake news

777
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:23,120
to prevent the submission of a message

778
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,640
of hesitation

779
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,679
to hatred uh

780
00:30:27,679 --> 00:30:30,720
culture for popular cuisine and

781
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:32,559
sometimes for reason on national

782
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,120
security

783
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:38,559
but that corresponds to variety of

784
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,640
those and then penetration in my country

785
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,919
for experience

786
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:44,000
has not become a significant enough

787
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,960
factor

788
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,200
that could have has been the

789
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,720
2019 not international down during the

790
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,919
election

791
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:55,120
so we can construct uh please

792
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,720
fema phenomenally uh way learning now

793
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,720
today at almost every election

794
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,880
in your country we can expect an

795
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:07,519
international dome

796
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:11,360
the last example is the congo

797
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,720
congo white despite the campaign to

798
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,240
prevent either

799
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:19,440
simply touch the simply cuts through the

800
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:20,000
internet

801
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,600
organization so uh

802
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,600
this is to say how the parent is

803
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,000
actually has become

804
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,279
social media outlet primarily uh affect

805
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:32,080
service

806
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:35,200
and can easily bypass with a complete

807
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,320
outage or

808
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,120
affect the antenna network and has

809
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,000
global

810
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:43,600
impact that for just for

811
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,919
censorship so he's my i think

812
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:50,240
thanks

813
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:54,159
yes um thank you all for your

814
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:57,200
um submissions and i do agree they

815
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:58,640
resonate very well with

816
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,679
the findings that we come across under

817
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:02,399
the capital

818
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,440
campaign and um i

819
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,000
normally see that the government seem to

820
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,559
be learning from each other

821
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,799
once a government shuts down the

822
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:14,559
internet during the election

823
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,600
whether it solves the problems

824
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,039
or the justifications they would

825
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:21,039
normally give or not another

826
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,640
country would repeat

827
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:27,440
something similar in response to

828
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,000
elections

829
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,640
and one thing we've also noticed is the

830
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,200
um

831
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
correlation between offline and online

832
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:34,880
repression

833
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,399
so um normally you know or have reports

834
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,640
of journalists being arbitrarily

835
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:44,000
detained or arrested or

836
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,399
human rights violations being

837
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:48,960
perpetrated on the ground and then

838
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:51,440
um shutdowns actually make it difficult

839
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:53,120
for the same journalists

840
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:56,720
and human rights defenders to

841
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
access information around these human

842
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,880
rights violations

843
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,000
and this is very dangerous

844
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,360
for the human rights community so before

845
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,919
we

846
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,679
continue the discussion i just want to

847
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,000
find out from our participants

848
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,960
um do you have any questions at this

849
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,240
point

850
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:20,559
and if you do please

851
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:23,039
raise your hand or unmute yourself and

852
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:24,399
speak

853
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:27,439
if that's okay with you

854
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:32,399
okay um retrieve

855
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,000
hello my name is beatrice i work for the

856
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,640
bbc

857
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,799
in the united kingdom and i've got a

858
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,080
question for marianne

859
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,200
you talked about infrastructure

860
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,840
failures in south america cutting off

861
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:49,039
areas

862
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,600
in terms of internet connectivity are

863
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,519
you suggesting that their infrastructure

864
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,320
failures

865
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,000
because of lack of the genuine

866
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:57,840
infrastructure failures because of lack

867
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:58,960
of investment and that

868
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,120
is a threat to democracy or are you

869
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,440
suggesting that they're deliberate

870
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,279
infrastructure failures on the parts of

871
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,279
government in order to shut down the

872
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:09,679
internet

873
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,320
that's an excellent question beatrice

874
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:16,639
thank you i am suggesting both

875
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,760
there is infrastructural failure that

876
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:20,480
happens

877
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:23,760
for lack of maintenance and for lack

878
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,119
of investment and this is

879
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,040
a reality because we are mostly

880
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,079
a poor region with

881
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,560
variations somewhat drastic between

882
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,679
country to country but

883
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:40,960
still poor but

884
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,159
as a work that

885
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,560
my colleagues have done and myself have

886
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,199
done

887
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:50,560
suggests in some places the lack of

888
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,159
investment in infrastructure for

889
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,639
telecommunications

890
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:57,280
is a political decision so if you are

891
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,000
deciding

892
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,839
to put that money into social control

893
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:04,160
into technology for social control or

894
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,839
into the military

895
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:09,119
instead of managing your infrastructure

896
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,200
in a way that allows people to connect

897
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,240
at

898
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,480
an adequate level then that's a

899
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,520
political choice

900
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
when you have a failure of that kind on

901
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:19,520
the other hand

902
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:21,440
in places like my country which is a

903
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,800
failed state

904
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,760
when you have a certain kind of

905
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,720
infrastructure

906
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:30,560
failure and then they say oh this

907
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,200
entire city was cut off from from the

908
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,000
internet

909
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,720
for three days at the same time i

910
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,520
protest what

911
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,480
was happening and thanks for coming in

912
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,280
to

913
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,280
deal with the protesters but this was

914
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,960
there was an absolute blackout so

915
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:47,280
there's no information from that

916
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,400
and but no it was an iguana

917
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,800
that ate the cable because you know in

918
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,760
my country

919
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,920
iguanas like to eat cables like it's

920
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,680
very delicious to them

921
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,920
so that kind of restricts their cut

922
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,960
it is very much not an accident and and

923
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
when you are inside

924
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:10,400
um i mean it is still difficult

925
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,520
to prove from a from a technical

926
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,640
investigative

927
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,119
standpoint but for a person who is

928
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:19,440
inside the blackout it is very obvious

929
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,520
it's very easy to see that it is

930
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,560
intentional

931
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,280
so yes i think that those two things are

932
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,079
at place

933
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,480
at the same time thank you

934
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,680
thank you very much teachers for your

935
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,880
question okay i have another hand queen

936
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:41,680
sorry if i mispronounced your name and

937
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,640
no that's fine

938
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:45,760
uh my name is viland van dijk i'm i work

939
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,920
for nrc in the netherlands

940
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
and i have a question really for all the

941
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:52,839
speakers thank you all for your

942
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,880
interesting

943
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:58,640
um i was wondering that

944
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:00,480
for uh for a regime to shut down the

945
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,760
internet there's a troop

946
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,880
there's there's costs

947
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:08,000
it disrupts businesses it takes down

948
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,240
electronic banking it's not something

949
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,440
that you can

950
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:14,640
uh easily do without harming your

951
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,200
economy the further economy outside the

952
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,560
the internet and i was wondering if

953
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,760
you're seeing

954
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:24,240
um uh keeping that into account

955
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,480
uh developing their technical

956
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,680
capabilities to

957
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,200
to um to limit the

958
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:34,480
these consequences

959
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:38,400
so uh well interested in your

960
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:41,119
opinion on that

961
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:50,720
can i answer that please do thank you

962
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,079
well that that's that's really very very

963
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:57,599
uh good question um i cannot speak

964
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,280
about iran so your your point is right

965
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,160
but uh it's interesting to know what

966
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,359
iran is doing

967
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,720
to basically reduce that cost as

968
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,079
as much as possible the entire reason

969
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:14,160
that they created this local

970
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:15,200
infrastructure

971
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,040
as they call it national information

972
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:19,520
network or we usually address

973
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:22,720
that like national internet

974
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,800
right but the official name is national

975
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,920
information network

976
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,400
the entire reason that they want to

977
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,760
localize

978
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:32,079
everything inside the country is to

979
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:34,880
reduce the cost of internet shutdown

980
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,760
the the the the internet shutdown that

981
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
we had in

982
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:42,320
uh let me check my calendar in in

983
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,760
november 2009

984
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:47,599
more than 12 days actually was a test

985
00:38:47,599 --> 00:38:50,240
to see if they can reduce that cost

986
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,200
because

987
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,400
when when they encourage people to come

988
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,480
inside the country use the local

989
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,480
services and infrastructure

990
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,240
it was because when they shut down the

991
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,240
internet the local services they

992
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,400
they they can work like we have like

993
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,520
iranian uber

994
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,400
uh snap that it was totally working uh

995
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,880
online banking was totally working

996
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,839
and it's interesting to know there is a

997
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:16,079
there is an international angle that

998
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:18,880
actually helped iranian governments to

999
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:21,920
do that you know the u.s takes sanctions

1000
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:25,119
when the entire basically

1001
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:27,520
encouraging program subsidize the

1002
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,599
traffic everything that they did

1003
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,839
to encourage people to move inside the

1004
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,839
country and use the local services was a

1005
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,680
failure project simply because

1006
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,320
no one trusted the government but

1007
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,440
because of the usa

1008
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,520
sanctions people were kicked out from

1009
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,599
the international infrastructures like

1010
00:39:43,599 --> 00:39:46,240
aws digital ocean and all of things

1011
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,079
and the only solution only option was

1012
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:50,320
moving back inside iran

1013
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,079
and that's actually the reason we are

1014
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,079
seeing uh in

1015
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:56,560
november shutdown that local services

1016
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:57,280
was working

1017
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,359
fine and they were happy actually it was

1018
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:00,400
a test

1019
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,200
and international services was uh uh

1020
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,280
inaccessible to the iranian government

1021
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,440
so the things that makes me honestly

1022
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:08,720
afraid and scared

1023
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,680
of the future of the localization it's

1024
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,960
not because of the technical

1025
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,480
infrastructure which is good

1026
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,319
it's good that you can access to the

1027
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:17,520
data

1028
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,400
fast and no cheap that the technical

1029
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,680
side is fine

1030
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,480
but the policy maker how they use this

1031
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,319
infrastructure makes me

1032
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:29,680
really scared to see the same pattern on

1033
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,760
other countries that that is going to

1034
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:33,599
happen it's going to be a really really

1035
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:38,960
scary situation

1036
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:42,480
thank you thank you thank you very much

1037
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,920
okay um we have jian hi

1038
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:48,160
i didn't realize i had to use the raised

1039
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,119
hand

1040
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,040
feature in the chat so i was waving my

1041
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:52,880
hand beforehand

1042
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,079
to all the panelists uh have a question

1043
00:40:56,079 --> 00:40:57,200
um

1044
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,520
so from from what i've understood there

1045
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:01,680
are in some cases some

1046
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,319
legal measures are they are underpinning

1047
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:05,599
some of these shutdowns

1048
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:08,319
such as for instance in zambia so i was

1049
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:09,520
wondering in order to

1050
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,880
challenge shutdowns is there any

1051
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,319
way to use courts is that effective are

1052
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:18,079
leaders in these countries going to

1053
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:20,000
really take notice

1054
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,079
or is the solution to this problem going

1055
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:23,280
to come from

1056
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:26,160
why the i don't know diplomatic pressure

1057
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:26,560
or

1058
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,720
technological disruption what is going

1059
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:30,000
to end this

1060
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,560
are courtrooms going to be one way or

1061
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,760
should we just wait for

1062
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:36,800
something new to arise some kind of

1063
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,160
more decentralized internet structure

1064
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:44,720
or i don't know by them being very angry

1065
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,359
can i go from zambia since it was

1066
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:51,759
mentioned

1067
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:57,119
yes absolutely yeah so uh

1068
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,160
in zambia that is that is

1069
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,359
what um an ideal situation in an ideal

1070
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:06,640
environment

1071
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:09,280
the courts uh were supposed to have um

1072
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:09,839
hope

1073
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,240
in the courts were supposed to have um

1074
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,920
that relief

1075
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,560
but that is not how it is you know uh so

1076
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,880
you find the the appointment of judges

1077
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:19,119
and

1078
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,200
how the judges behave when down the

1079
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:22,400
benches

1080
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:24,400
it's very biased and you can see the

1081
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,319
influence of the ruling elite in court

1082
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,160
decisions so

1083
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:31,200
but not all hope is lost uh

1084
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,480
we we currently have a petition

1085
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,160
before the courts because we have

1086
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,760
challenged the cyber crime the cyber

1087
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:39,200
security act

1088
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,720
and sometimes

1089
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,240
you just have to do the action so that

1090
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,839
you exhaust all the

1091
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:48,960
the the the processes but the courts in

1092
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,800
zambia especially when it comes to such

1093
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:51,520
issues

1094
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,359
they are not seen to be helpful because

1095
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:55,680
they seem to agree with the state

1096
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:57,440
they they you know because the courts

1097
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,880
are

1098
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,960
the old judges and all that so they

1099
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,319
don't like the internet

1100
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,599
they think the internet's a source of

1101
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:06,720
problems social media and all that

1102
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,000
so even if their rulings are

1103
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:13,440
and are not pro internet freedoms

1104
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,400
but in zimbabwe for example they went to

1105
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,760
the courts and it was challenged based

1106
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,520
on the constitution and all that

1107
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:21,839
so we it's a 50 50 thing but the

1108
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,800
confidence

1109
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,760
that the courts would protect our

1110
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,599
interests and all that

1111
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:30,640
is is very low it's very low because of

1112
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,400
what has happened in the past

1113
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,920
there's a very strong political

1114
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,200
influence in most of our lives

1115
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,920
most of the public institutions here uh

1116
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:42,720
because of

1117
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,839
intolerance because of abuse of

1118
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:48,079
power you know the departure from the

1119
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:49,200
rule of law

1120
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,440
policy inconsistency and all that so

1121
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,599
when most decisions are based

1122
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:57,040
only on the political affiliation

1123
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,839
so that is the problem we have maybe

1124
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:01,200
also i can respond to another question

1125
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:01,520
like

1126
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:05,440
the the impact of internet shutdown

1127
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:08,079
like how do they how do our leaders see

1128
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,200
it

1129
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,560
so in zambia for as long as

1130
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,560
anything that threatens those that are

1131
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:17,280
among the ruling elites

1132
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:21,359
it doesn't it doesn't matter

1133
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:22,720
but they'll just go ahead and make an

1134
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,480
unpopular decision so even if the

1135
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,880
internet shutdown is costly on the

1136
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,079
economy here

1137
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:31,920
they'll still do it and they pretend

1138
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:34,640
that they did it because it was

1139
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:36,079
threatening national security

1140
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:39,520
and hygiene and this is our our what

1141
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,760
our argument like what should we

1142
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,119
prioritize between

1143
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:45,839
national security and the freedoms

1144
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:47,520
especially internet freedoms

1145
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,480
because often the way the phrase

1146
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,240
national security actually does not

1147
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,280
defeat what action is being

1148
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,599
discussed so we find that anything that

1149
00:44:57,599 --> 00:44:58,720
someone says or

1150
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:02,240
when there are these hackathons when

1151
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,560
all these online protests they say no

1152
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:06,400
this is threatening national security

1153
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:07,119
and

1154
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,440
what is national security come on yes

1155
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,200
national security we want that because

1156
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,079
we want to be

1157
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:14,640
safe and secure but also what is

1158
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:16,319
national security

1159
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:18,079
in the absence of freedoms you cannot

1160
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,680
have freedom without security

1161
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,680
you cannot have security also in the

1162
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,119
absence of freedoms

1163
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:25,200
so i find that the national security has

1164
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,560
been weaponized

1165
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:29,599
for to is to inspire

1166
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:33,520
uh the invocation of all these orders to

1167
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,560
to you know to shut down internet to

1168
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,359
to digitize all the wrong things and it

1169
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:41,680
doesn't matter whether that also

1170
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,839
has has an effect on how the financial

1171
00:45:43,839 --> 00:45:45,440
technology is running and

1172
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,000
just everything else so we the biggest

1173
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,720
problem we have here is that of

1174
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,599
growing repression and intolerance to

1175
00:45:53,599 --> 00:45:54,480
divergent

1176
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,119
views and opinions that is only thing

1177
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,520
that

1178
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:59,520
that matters that are those that are

1179
00:45:59,520 --> 00:46:01,760
critical they must not speak

1180
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:03,680
and we can they can shut down the

1181
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,280
internet based on

1182
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:08,240
on those criticisms very unfortunate and

1183
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,359
that is that is it

1184
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:12,800
from yeah thank you okay thank you very

1185
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:13,440

00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:28,800
um there was no internet shutdown and we

1192
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,079
did mention that the

1193
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,119
internet was disrupted in 2019 during

1194
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:36,240
parliamentary elections but um

1195

00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:46,400
happened

1200
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,680
what changed in benin to

1201
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,279
ensure that there was no internet

1202
00:46:54,839 --> 00:46:57,839
district

1203
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,040
thank you for a question uh

1204
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,839
to 2020 we reserve warning

1205
00:47:07,839 --> 00:47:10,880
that's a possible international ground

1206
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:14,000
for more municipal elections

1207
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,280
you know last year and for this year

1208
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,640
it was reported on sale reaction so

1209
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:23,440
we decided to a theory of proactive

1210
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,400
action

1211
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,480
had to be taken to prevent a possible

1212
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:27,680
international

1213
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:31,040
before during and after election

1214
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:34,960
so for for first action

1215
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,800
we wish to keep it uh

1216
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:42,319
we felicia for myself now to sing

1217

00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:53,359
her from the opportunity

1220
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,640
secondly uh we have posts on social

1221
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,440
network to promote a platform to fight

1222
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,680
against signals

1223
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,640
that we have helped to develop food the

1224
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:07,440
internet community of union

1225
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,640

1226
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:13,599
website support by antenna society

1227
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:14,720
global

1228
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,760
to explain the disaster is consequence

1229
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,400
that an international down would have on

1230
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,800
the country but for economically

1231
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,359
financially socially politically

1232
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,520
executed

1233
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:31,599
we we have made

1234
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:35,280
an interview we were

1235
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,839
situation that and the concern we

1236
00:48:46,839 --> 00:48:49,200
felt we were feeling

1237
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:53,839
so uh in locally for

1238
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:57,359
action with a question of

1239

other civil society organization we

1240
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:02,640
launched a very large campaign

1241
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:05,598
on social media

1242
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:09,119
with tips posters

1243
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:12,000
which explain each day a consequence of

1244
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:13,520
international

1245
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:16,559
a message of human rights

1246
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:20,880

a public conference

1255
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:51,760
to inform rise

1256
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:56,160
denotes a possible shutdown

1257
00:49:56,480 --> 00:50:00,480
and the date the day of election

1258
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:04,480

1259
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:09,520
to detecting on internet credit

1260
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:12,880
and uh we we post it previously

1261

uh publica with

1262
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:20,160
the state of network in three countries

1263
00:50:20,160 --> 00:50:22,799
which are

1264
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,880
either we have

1265
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:31,200
we also wanted to initiate a person and

1266
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:32,319
first like this

1267
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:35,599
to prevent better we have no time so

1268
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:38,960
that these visas

1269
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:42,000
the different action of that web we have

1270
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:42,559
put

1271
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:46,079
in place and uh it was a great joy for

1272
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:46,559
us

1273
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,079
to see that until the day after election

1274
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:53,119
we had online and without my

1275
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:58,160
technical problem so after that

1276
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,359
it's okay okay

1277
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:04,400
no change okay all right thank you very

1278
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:04,800
much

1279
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,359
and it's indeed it's always a great joy

1280
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,280
to

1281
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:12,079
see that people enjoy their rights on

1282
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:12,880
the internet

1283
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:14,800
because the impacts of international

1284
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:17,040
talks are very devastating

1285
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:20,559
and um just to add on to what you said

1286
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,359
um they keep the capitol um campaign we

1287
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:23,920
have

1288
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,599
a an election struck up which we

1289
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:27,440
launched beginning of this year

1290
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:30,240
and so we have all the elections we have

1291
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:30,559
um

1292
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:33,520
noted as high risk that is risk of a

1293
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:34,559
shutdown happening

1294
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,960
um and that at the time of those

1295
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:38,559
elections and so

1296
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:41,200

00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,400
identified in this

1300
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,839

00:52:24,319 --> 00:52:26,960
the chat and all of the resources that

1319
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,880
uh my colleague felicia is sharing

1320
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,359
including some positive

1321
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,000
news when it comes to court cases and uh

1322
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,160
court victories when it when it comes to

1323
00:52:36,160 --> 00:52:37,599
internet students it's something that we

1324
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:39,520
definitely want uh

1325
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:42,240
as a coalition to to invest in a bit

1326
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:44,160
more and to put more resources behind

1327
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,800
but

1328
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:47,359
of course it depends of of the content

1329
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:49,680
on the context sorry and how

1330
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:52,480
we can rely or not on the on the

1331
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,000
judicial

1332
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,880
process so i have a question to all

1333
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,760
speakers

1334
00:52:57,760 --> 00:53:00,960
when it comes to because we have

1335
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,000
several reporters in the room and so how

1336
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:05,040
can journalists

1337
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,839
report on internet shutdowns and and

1338
00:53:07,839 --> 00:53:09,359
digital repression

1339
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,839
and support the work that you that

1340
00:53:11,839 --> 00:53:14,960
you're doing so i'm not asking about

1341
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:15,280
like

1342
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,160
tools that they can use to circumvent uh

1343
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,680
shutdowns and so on like

1344
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,920
these uh these tools i mean if there is

1345
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,200
interest let me know but

1346
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,599
we we've published some material about

1347
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:27,440
it and we're happy to

1348
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,960
that would make us succeed

1349
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,760
exceed the timeline but more in terms of

1350
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:35,680
journalists and reporters

1351
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:37,839
working on on that topic when they do

1352
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,040
cover elections

1353
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:43,280
what would be helpful to your work

1354
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,040
and how should they report on internet

1355
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:47,599
shutdowns

1356
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:52,640
i have things to say about that

1357
00:53:53,119 --> 00:53:55,359
it is important to me that when

1358
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:56,640
reporters cover

1359
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,680
internet shutdowns or any other kind of

1360
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,680
internet disruption

1361
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:05,760
um that they make space to tell the

1362
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:08,400
story of people affected by it

1363
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:10,720
because oftentimes they just focus on

1364
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,520
numbers

1365
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,359
which is understandable because numbers

1366
00:54:13,359 --> 00:54:15,200
are hard and

1367
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:18,240
facts and journalists are or about

1368
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,640
facts and facts are very important of

1369
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:22,400
course but if you tell me

1370
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,960
that i don't know ten thousand people

1371
00:54:24,960 --> 00:54:27,040
were affected it really doesn't

1372
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:30,000
sound like much for people it sounds

1373
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,440
like it was a small village and

1374
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,720
sometimes it depends of course

1375
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:36,559
on the people on the country but

1376
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:39,280
for those people it's terrible it is a

1377
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:40,000
lot

1378
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,079
and it affects their livelihood it

1379
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:43,359
affects their ability to

1380
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:45,440
study if it affects their ability to

1381
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:46,640
work

1382
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:50,000
more so over during this pandemic

1383
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,520
and if they give space to both maybe

1384
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,839
two facts and also stories but also

1385
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,440
stories are facts

1386
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,240
there are just no numbers and if you

1387
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,440
keep that in mind

1388
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,799
i think it makes for a more

1389
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,559
comprehensive approach

1390
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:08,720
to reporting um something like this and

1391
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,799
it makes for people for the general

1392
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:11,760
audience

1393
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:14,400
more easy to understand why a shutdown

1394
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,400
is important particularly for those

1395
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:21,839
that haven't lived through one

1396
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:26,559
thank you marianne any other perspective

1397
00:55:26,559 --> 00:55:29,920
uh from our speakers

1398
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,119
one more point uh based on the

1399
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:36,240
experience of the last

1400
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,839
international shutdown in province of

1401
00:55:37,839 --> 00:55:40,000
system balochistan in iran

1402
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:43,440
um i think when it comes to like uh

1403
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:46,319
uh so i i i think one of the best things

1404
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:48,480
that they can do is uh

1405
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,200
maybe it's all work actually to provide

1406
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,240
resources

1407
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,559
to let the journalists know who you need

1408
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,760
to listen

1409
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,920
to because in the last internet

1410
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,839
shadowing somebody just done

1411
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,240
almost three days before the shutdown

1412
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,480
some political opposition for their own

1413
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,079
political agenda

1414
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,319
they said internet is shut down in

1415
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:09,280
system

1416
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,160
which was we hadn't shut down back then

1417
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,280
three days after

1418
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:16,000
that announcement uh we had shut down

1419
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,000
and the new the entire news was

1420
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,559
killed actually just because of the

1421
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:22,559
false at uh the internet shot an

1422
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:23,280
announcement

1423
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,400
for their own political agenda so i i

1424
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,880
think you need to basically verify your

1425
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:31,599
your uh sources to see if like some

1426
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,960
anonymous

1427
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:35,680
person on on twitter is saying it's shut

1428
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,319
down and

1429
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,400
these people are not living inside the

1430
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:39,359
country

1431
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:42,079
so that that that's that's a problem

1432
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:43,520
when we need to

1433
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:46,079
basically pay attention to the horrible

1434
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,440
things that happening

1435
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:50,880
so i think listening to the real expert

1436
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,920
local people uh or like keep it on

1437
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,480
campaign

1438
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:56,240
people they they have access to

1439
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,319
resources and access to the local

1440
00:56:58,319 --> 00:56:59,680
activities

1441
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,359
i think that that's the most important

1442
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:04,640
thing uh journalists can do

1443
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:09,520
thank you any thoughts from richard

1444
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:10,480
maybe

1445
00:57:10,480 --> 00:57:13,680
or harold or has it all

1446
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:16,558
been covered

1447
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,720
oh sorry

1448
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,440
i miss your question oh no sorry i was

1449
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:30,480
just asking

1450
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:33,440
um what would be helpful for your work

1451
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
when journalists report on internet

1452
00:57:35,440 --> 00:57:36,319
shutdowns

1453
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:39,040
so what is helpful in terms of maybe the

1454
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,000
information that they

1455
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:42,799
share or the people that they they they

1456
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,280
speak to

1457
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:51,440
okay uh about january's uh departing

1458
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:55,040
is is christian

1459
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:08,400
to educate citizens onshore progression

1460
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:11,920
yes just like that

1461
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,200
yeah so and from from our perspective

1462
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,200
in zambia we feel even journalism itself

1463
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:22,960
is uh

1464
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:25,760
is affected is impacted by by internet

1465
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,760
shutdown whether it's filtering jamming

1466
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:28,319
and

1467
00:58:28,319 --> 00:58:30,960
and all that anything that restricts

1468
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,480
access to the internet or blocks access

1469
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:33,520
to the internet

1470
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,640
is detrimental to a free

1471
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:40,079
and an independent press but with regard

1472
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:41,359
to the content

1473
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:43,680
and all that the the products of

1474
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,920
journalism we think it's very important

1475
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,200
because it takes the information out

1476
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,079
there

1477
00:58:50,079 --> 00:58:51,920
in order to influence internet law and

1478
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:55,200
policy it informs the other people

1479
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:59,680
it informs the stakeholders it helps to

1480
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,880
increase the the standards the the best

1481
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,400
only

1482
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:07,760
regional and global norms

1483
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:11,119
on on what only on the right to internet

1484
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,079
access

1485
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:15,520
we feel journalism plays a critical role

1486
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:18,640
in informing in educating if you

1487
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:21,359
journalism is critical to to all the

1488
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:24,400
narrative because it just

1489
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,119
creates that platform for engagement

1490
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:27,520
that

1491
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:30,799
platform like i said for influencing and

1492
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:34,160
for for networking for for people in the

1493
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,680
west in the north

1494
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:37,680
and everywhere to be able to know what

1495
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,200
is happening this side

1496
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:41,839
so that we can be informed about the

1497
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:42,640
trends

1498
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,520
and then we can come up with better

1499
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:46,319
advocacy

1500
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:48,799
and campaign strategies and and just all

1501
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:49,680
that so

1502
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:52,480
we feel it's very important to do that

1503
00:59:52,480 --> 00:59:54,799
thank you

1504
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:59,200
thank you and i just want to sorry

1505
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,240
felicia

1506
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:03,440
i just wanted to quickly um follow up on

1507
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:04,160
one of

1508
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,480
actually a few things that our speakers

1509
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:08,559
have shared when it comes to

1510
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:11,119
sharing data or sharing statistics

1511
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:11,920
because

1512
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:13,119
whether it's the number of people

1513
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:15,760
affected uh it's also the case for

1514
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:18,319
the the number of shutdowns and we've

1515
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:20,079
faced this because we publish this

1516
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,280
annual report and

1517
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:24,240
and um and periodic updates about the

1518
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:26,240
number of shutdowns and so if you look

1519
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:28,480
at the numbers since 2019

1520
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:30,720
the numbers have been decreasing which

1521
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,160
could you know look we could celebrate

1522
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,400
it

1523
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:34,000
like yes to keep it on campaign has been

1524
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,440
great work and we have fewer

1525
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:38,000
shutdowns and it's less of an issue but

1526
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,920
unfortunately we can't celebrate

1527
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:43,520
uh in this way because um

1528
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:45,200
while the number of shutdowns has

1529
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:47,119
reduced last year for example

1530
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,119
and since the beginning of the year

1531
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:50,160
we've seen a

1532
01:00:50,160 --> 01:00:52,640
deep as well compared to the the first

1533
01:00:52,640 --> 01:00:53,599
half of

1534
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:56,319
the first half of half of the year of

1535
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:57,680
the previous years

1536
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,000
uh but what we've noticed however is

1537
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:00,880
that the

1538
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,640
shutdowns last longer or that the

1539
01:01:04,640 --> 01:01:07,040
the networks that are affected can maybe

1540
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:08,400
like affect more people

1541
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,200
and so on so it's always tricky even for

1542
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:11,520
us

1543
01:01:11,520 --> 01:01:14,799
uh working on this issue to convey

1544
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:18,160
um what exactly is happening or who

1545
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:18,720
exactly

1546
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,920
is impacted and what we can

1547
01:01:21,920 --> 01:01:23,680
learn from and the different patterns

1548
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,200
when we look just at the numbers and

1549
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:26,240
that's why that

1550
01:01:26,240 --> 01:01:28,000
we're trying to always provide this

1551
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,760
additional context and this additional

1552
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,880
information

1553
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,119
when it comes to the nature of shutdown

1554
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:34,799
and um

1555
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:37,200
and their impact and very often actually

1556
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,640
it's multiple

1557
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:40,960
uh multiple impacts and multiple

1558
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,400
consequences so

1559
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:45,280
just a quick note from me on sharing

1560
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,240
numbers and and sharing statistics

1561
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:53,440
but fetisha over to you

1562
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:56,799
yes i actually wanted to add um a

1563
01:01:56,799 --> 01:01:57,520
suggestion

1564
01:01:57,520 --> 01:02:00,480
that i think would also be relevant um

1565
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,760
we do have

1566
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,240
um journalists or media that are very

1567
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:06,319
interested in the work that we do

1568
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:09,200
so um let's also proactively identify

1569
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:09,839
them

1570
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:12,559
or reach out um to let them know our

1571
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:13,200
plans

1572
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:16,079
and um the trends that we are noticing

1573
01:02:16,079 --> 01:02:17,440
in our countries

1574
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:20,160
and um i'm sure they'll be interested in

1575
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:22,079
covering or listening to us

1576
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:25,119
once we need a platform to do that

1577
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:28,559
um all right um

1578
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:31,760
i have one question before we

1579
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:34,799
wrap up melody and um

1580
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:37,920
i am

1581
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:42,400
and um richard you have elections i mean

um and the elections is on the 18th so

1585
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:52,559
um what should we

1586
01:02:52,559 --> 01:02:55,680
expect this is not to say uh we need you

1587
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:56,640
to predict

1588
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,960
what will happen but then what do you

1589
01:02:58,960 --> 01:02:59,920
what does the

1590
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,680
landscape look like and the same

1591
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:03,520
question to you richard

1592
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:05,920
your elections are scheduled um for

1593
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:06,960
august

1594
01:03:06,960 --> 01:03:10,880
and um we will be working with you

1595
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,920
on a campaign so if you can also let us

1596
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,559
know what

1597
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:18,240
we should expect and how should we

1598
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:21,280
prepare to prevent a shutdown that'll be

1599
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:23,520
great

1600
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,440
richard you want to go ahead i can go

1601
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:30,400
back down i mean

1602
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:32,640
you you mentioned first so i'll go after

1603
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:34,720
you

1604
01:03:35,599 --> 01:03:38,960
thank you so i

1605
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:42,079
i i think we so so far what

1606
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:45,280
what we are seeing is uh it seems that

1607
01:03:45,280 --> 01:03:47,760
the outcome of election is already

1608
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:48,799
decided so

1609
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,839
because uh speaking of the going to the

1610
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:52,799
court for the

1611
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:55,440
like shutdown uh we don't have the rule

1612
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,440
of law in iran right so going to the

1613
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:59,200
court we don't have that kind of

1614
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,920
luxury unfortunate unfortunately in iran

1615
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,319
so

1616
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:04,240
it seems that the the outcome of

1617
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,520
election is is

1618
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,160
clear we know who is gonna win the

1619
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:09,359
election

1620
01:04:09,359 --> 01:04:12,720
uh and this person definitely everyone

1621
01:04:12,720 --> 01:04:13,440
gracie

1622
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:16,000
he is not definitely in favor of

1623
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:18,480
internet freedom and his team

1624
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:21,200
uh i i talked to a couple of people from

1625
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,039
his team on on different rooms on

1626
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,760
clubhouse and it's clear that

1627
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,599
they are not in favor of internet

1628
01:04:27,599 --> 01:04:29,839
freedom at all and they are not

1629
01:04:29,839 --> 01:04:33,039
familiar with the basic definition of

1630
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:34,720
the internet freedom

1631
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:37,599
and right now this person is important

1632
01:04:37,599 --> 01:04:39,760
why because he is the head of the

1633
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,839
judiciary right now so head of the

1634
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,760
judiciary right now is running for the

1635
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,119
presidency

1636
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,160
and and that on his

1637
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:51,680
watch uh basically uh we saw

1638
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:54,000
that based on the judiciary order they

1639
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,359
block signal

1640
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:59,598
they block telegram they blocked

1641
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,480
also clubhouse is blocked on some of the

1642
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:04,559
mobile provider in iran

1643
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,039
some of them they didn't blocked it but

1644
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:08,880
clearly the head of the judiciary they

1645
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:09,599
don't want to take

1646
01:05:09,599 --> 01:05:13,520
any action uh in terms of uh if he's

1647
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,359
he's saying he's in favor of internet

1648
01:05:15,359 --> 01:05:16,720
freedom in in

1649
01:05:16,720 --> 01:05:19,359
verbally but he's not taking any action

1650
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,079
and

1651
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:23,440
we are seeing a kind of uh

1652
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:26,559
disruption on network in iran uh based

1653
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,000
on the information that i'm receiving

1654
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:28,400
from

1655
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,839
from different people uh uh uh different

1656
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:33,760
uh basically still convention tools

1657
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,520
developer and and

1658
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:38,240
like ioda map and things like that that

1659
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,880
you're seeing kind of coordinated

1660
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,480
uh network disruption in iran so that's

1661
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,079
all of that together is concerning uh

1662
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:50,640
as i i think richard said about the

1663
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:52,400
national uh security

1664
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:54,799
in iran is the same is the case as well

1665
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:55,520
so

1666
01:05:55,520 --> 01:05:58,000
uh when they see the national security

1667
01:05:58,000 --> 01:05:58,720
is is

1668
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,359
in danger they would do anything to

1669
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:04,079
protect that national security so

1670
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:07,520
so uh again uh um having said

1671
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,240
all of these things i think uh uh we can

1672
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:11,359
expect

1673
01:06:11,359 --> 01:06:14,799
uh at least a disruption if if people uh

1674
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,720
want to protest against the outcome of

1675
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:19,119
the election or in any shape and form

1676
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:21,520
they are already contacting journalists

1677
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:22,720
and asking them to

1678
01:06:22,720 --> 01:06:25,280
not criticize a brian gracie in any

1679
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:26,240
shape and form

1680
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,480
on social media and article everything

1681
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:30,400
so so the the

1682
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:32,720
the general atmosphere is a fear

1683
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:33,839
atmosphere

1684
01:06:33,839 --> 01:06:37,359
uh and and again this this guy was in

1685
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:38,000
charge of

1686
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:40,799
mass execution after the revolution in

1687
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:41,599
iran

1688
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:47,119
uh so i i'm not an automation

1689
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:49,359
of the internet freedom and i think we

1690
01:06:49,359 --> 01:06:51,039
should be high alert

1691
01:06:51,039 --> 01:06:53,839
uh for for worst case scenario hopefully

1692
01:06:53,839 --> 01:06:54,240
not

1693
01:06:54,240 --> 01:06:56,079
no shutdown but who knows with this

1694
01:06:56,079 --> 01:07:00,880
situation everything is possible

1695
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:03,039
thank you very much and indeed it's

1696
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,760
always important to be prepared

1697
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:09,119
and i always say that um it's a very

1698
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:09,599
nice

1699
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,400
feeling when you prepare very well and

1700
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:14,480
there's no internet shutdown and that

1701
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:15,839
was the same feeling that

1702
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,559
um harold cited when there was no

1703
01:07:18,559 --> 01:07:20,240
international town in benin

1704
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,920
all right um richard thank you felicia

1705
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,200
so

1706
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:26,799
what are what do you expect in zambia

1707
01:07:26,799 --> 01:07:28,559
our elections are on august 12th it's a

1708
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:30,880
debt that is in the constitution

1709
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:33,440
so every five years we have elections on

1710
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:34,880
the fifth year on

1711
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:38,000
august 5. so what we expect

1712
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:40,160
and this is based on the trends the

1713
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,240
statements and how

1714
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:45,359
all these ict laws in zambia we are

1715
01:07:45,359 --> 01:07:47,359
i think we are first tracked in

1716
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:48,880
parliament you know they

1717
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:51,280
they suspended all the standing orders

1718
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:53,520
like the standard rules of making laws

1719
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:56,880
they were suspended so that the

1720
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:59,440
ict laws could quickly become law and

1721
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:00,960
this is what happened like

1722
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:03,200
within a week before we could blink and

1723
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:06,000
open our eyes like oh we have ict laws

1724
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,119
so you can see that there are

1725
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:12,880
tools that would facilitate what

1726
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:16,000
the the west that we expect the quan

1727
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:19,520
we expect a total internet shutdown

1728
01:08:19,520 --> 01:08:24,560
and uh also we expect um

1729
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:28,640
many people to be arrested before

1730
01:08:28,640 --> 01:08:31,600
during and even after the elections and

1731
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:32,799
by the way

1732
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:34,560
in addition to the i'm saying this

1733
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,839
because

1734
01:08:35,839 --> 01:08:38,479
in addition to the ict laws that we have

1735
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,600
the

1736
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:41,120
the elections law the electoral

1737
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:43,279
commission of zambia act

1738
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:46,080
has been amended to include a section

1739
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,120
where

1740
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:50,158
it is the only institution

1741
01:08:50,158 --> 01:08:52,479
that will have the legal mandate to

1742
01:08:52,479 --> 01:08:53,359
announce

1743
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:56,560
election results at any level

1744
01:08:56,560 --> 01:09:00,158
so in zambia we have got people

1745
01:09:00,158 --> 01:09:02,080
transmitting elections from polling

1746
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,000
stations from the polling centers

1747
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,679
under sharing and they are comparing the

1748
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,198
numbers and all this and that

1749
01:09:07,198 --> 01:09:09,759
so with the amendment of the elections

1750
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,198
act

1751
01:09:11,198 --> 01:09:13,279
is good that all that is going to become

1752
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,198
illegal whether you do it in twitter on

1753
01:09:15,198 --> 01:09:17,359
facebook or in whatsapp

1754
01:09:17,359 --> 01:09:20,479
so you can see that all of us who

1755
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:22,238
like to do this because at bloggers of

1756
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,719
zambia we monitor elections using

1757
01:09:24,719 --> 01:09:26,319
technology

1758
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,679
so we will have like turtling centers we

1759
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,198
have

1760
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:35,279
monitoring electro malpractices

1761
01:09:35,279 --> 01:09:39,040
and transmitting results like um

1762
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:41,040
number verifications and all that so all

1763
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,719
that work is gonna be illegal

1764
01:09:42,719 --> 01:09:44,080
but we're still gonna do it anyway so

1765
01:09:44,080 --> 01:09:45,359
you should look out for names in the

1766
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:46,799
media like oh these guys have been

1767
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:47,679
arrested

1768
01:09:47,679 --> 01:09:49,520
so that is what we expect shutdowns

1769
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:50,880
arrests

1770
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:54,080
all these prosecutions um

1771
01:09:54,080 --> 01:09:57,520
so with what what we need and

1772
01:09:57,520 --> 01:09:59,600
perhaps what what we are doing what is

1773
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:00,800
go what is happening

1774
01:10:00,800 --> 01:10:06,239
so we need to capacitate civil society

1775
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,920
journalists and lawyers and

1776
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:13,520
artists with digital hygiene

1777
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:16,960
like practical we are trying to prepare

1778
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:20,640
people with the visa like they are visad

1779
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:23,600
we are preparing the cohort like to just

1780
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:24,800
keep a certain people

1781
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:28,239
online and mount the campaign because

1782
01:10:28,239 --> 01:10:31,600
it's it's just gonna be vicious and

1783
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,960
um we think that kind of skill

1784
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:38,080
that kind of knowledge is needed in

1785
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:39,679
order to just prepare

1786
01:10:39,679 --> 01:10:42,400
about all these negative expectations

1787
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,760
coming out of this

1788
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:47,199
because of the the deep interest the the

1789
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:49,440
deep campaign against internet freedoms

1790
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:51,199
that is going on in them

1791
01:10:51,199 --> 01:10:55,040
so that is it thank you

1792
01:10:55,199 --> 01:10:58,560

uh and thank you everyone for attending

1829
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:28,400
we really believe that this is such an

1830
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,440
important issue

1831
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:31,920
and so that's why just having the

1832
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,679
opportunity to discuss it and we're

1833
01:12:33,679 --> 01:12:34,840
always

1834
01:12:34,840 --> 01:12:37,600
um pleased when we see

1835
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:40,800
um shutdowns mentioned and

1836
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:43,360
reported on the media not for our ego

1837
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:45,120
and not just for our own

1838
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,719
uh the the pleasure of seeing or working

1839
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:50,480
the press or the issues that we care

1840
01:12:50,480 --> 01:12:51,440
about in the press

1841
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,400
but really because we know that shutting

1842
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:55,040
access

1843
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:58,159
to the internet the the primary goal of

1844
01:12:58,159 --> 01:12:58,560
that

1845
01:12:58,560 --> 01:13:01,360
is to disconnect people and to make them

1846
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,960
lose their voice and to make them lose

1847
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,679
their ability to share information

1848
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:07,440
very often with the outside world but

1849
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:09,600
sometimes even internally and so

1850
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,320
of course when there is a lot of media

1851
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:13,040
coverage

1852
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:14,719
it kind of defeats the purpose sometimes

1853
01:13:14,719 --> 01:13:16,640
it completely uh

1854
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:19,199
it completely it proves to be a

1855
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,800
completely

1856
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:23,280
unproductive technique so we believe

1857
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:24,880
that actually

1858
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,960
journalists are part of the solution

1859
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:28,719
when it comes to the fight for keeping

1860
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:29,199
on

1861
01:13:29,199 --> 01:13:31,520
so thank you very much for for joining

1862
01:13:31,520 --> 01:13:32,239
and

1863
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,239
let's stay in touch if you have any more

1864
01:13:34,239 --> 01:13:35,840
questions

1865

thank you everyone bye-bye
