1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,439
hi all good morning afternoon

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,839
evening wherever you may be my name is

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,279
greg waters and i am from the

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,960
sustainability accounting standards

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,760
board

6
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,559
most often known as sasby so thanks so

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,639
much to accessnow for for allowing me a

8
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:16,560
few minutes to speak here and plug

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
an important research project that's

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,000
ongoing at sasby

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
so we are an independent nonprofit

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,519
standard setting organization

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,199
and we're dedicated to facilitating the

14
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,039
disclosure of financially impactful

15
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,880
environmental and social issues from

16
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,599
companies

17
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,040
to their investors we exist because we

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,320
believe that capital markets are a

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,360
critical level for

20
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,200
for achieving a more sustainable and

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:38,559
just future

22
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:40,719
our standards are industry specific and

23
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,239
designed to capture a subset of

24
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,600
information

25
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,600
sustainability information that is most

26
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
likely to impact

27
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,120
financial performance of companies and

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,559
we are actively backed by

29
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,480
a group of investors with around 60

30
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,160
trillion dollars in assets under

31
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,039
management

32
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,600
and we are being our standards are being

33
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,320
used to

34
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,600
report by about 500 different companies

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,400
across 70 different industries and that

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,640
growth is about 350 percent year on year

37
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,000
so we're really excited by the momentum

38
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,280
we've achieved

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,840
as an organization in driving for more

40
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,360
comparable and complete

41
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
sustainability disclosure

42
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
this this audience understands why

43
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,479
transparency around things like data

44
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,400
privacy and content governance are

45
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
really important societally

46
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,560
but there's also this financial impact

47
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,400
angle and that's why sasby has gotten

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,320
involved so i thought i'd spend a moment

49
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,119
or two

50
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,159
speaking to that so uh the first line

51
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:34,960
item i would say

52
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,720
is on the revenue side and i think if we

53
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,040
think about content governance as

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,000
what users see on a given platform and

55
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,119
when

56
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,840
that really is critical to uh you know a

57
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,600
company's business strategy how they

58
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,680
attract and retain not just users

59
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,680
but also advertisers and that balance of

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,399
you know monitoring for harmful content

61
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,600
while protecting user freedom of

62
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,399
expression

63
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,000
we see different approaches and

64
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,680
strategies taken by different platforms

65
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,880
depending on the design

66
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,520
of their platform from the cost

67
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,719
perspective

68
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
of course we now know that thousands if

69
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,758
not tens of thousands of people

70
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
at various companies are are reviewing

71
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:12,879
content

72
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,800
uh and uh that's obviously it's a

73
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,400
significant form of investment

74
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,520
the other would be the capital

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,000
expenditure associated with automated

76
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,200
flagging systems

77
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
using techniques like machine learning

78
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,400
and the last thing i would mention on

79
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,599
the financial side would be the

80
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,200
regulatory piece

81
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,840
in that we we know that the u.s and the

82
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,120
european commission as well with the

83
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
digital services act

84
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:35,280
um are mulling proposed changes that

85
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
would severely uh potentially impact

86
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,080
how companies not just moderate but also

87
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,000
kind of you know really show content to

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,040
users so

89
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,959
uh major implications there in terms of

90
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,239
you're thinking of this with an investor

91
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,239
lens in terms of risk return profile

92
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,000
um you know how might a different

93
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,280
company's uh

94
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,560
platform be impacted by different

95
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,480
regulations is clearly clearly of

96
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,760
interest

97
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,959
so in terms of transparency reporting um

98
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,319
obviously they're critical for

99
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,159
accountability to a broad variety of

100
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,040
stakeholders

101
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,480
but also the metrics that have been

102
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,080
developed and are being used by number

103
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,360
of companies

104
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,280
on areas like content moderation are

105
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,920
also of interest to investors

106
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:14,400
so sasby standards actually already use

107
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,760
a number of transparency reporting

108
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,319
metrics

109
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
these include information about law

110
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,599
enforcement

111
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,680
data sharing as well as content removal

112
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,360
requests from governments

113
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,920
the next piece for sasby is we are now

114
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
evaluating uh

115
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,720
potential changes to our standards to

116
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,959
include voluntary content moderation and

117
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,640
content governance themes

118
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,799
so really really eager to uh to hear

119
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:36,239
from companies and subject matter

120
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,120
experts

121
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,040
such as the people on the panel that's

122
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,480
about to come up here

123
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,239
we are we are open we're a market

124
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,560
informed and consensus and stakeholder

125
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,000
driven organization

126
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,360
in terms of understanding what are the

127
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,280
most important uh issues and

128
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,920
the best ways to be capturing uh the

129
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,599
performance of companies on this topic

130
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,000
so

131
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
so eager to connect so so thanks again

132
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,400
to accessnow for having me and allowing

133
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
me to to plug this project

134
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
and looking forward to the discussion

135
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,760
take care everyone
