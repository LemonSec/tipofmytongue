great so um

51
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
uh the first conversation definitely is

52
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,439
going to be about content moderation

53
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,200
obviously so um

54
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
so i can start with some of my personal

55
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,799
experiences with

56
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,799
using twitter's content moderation so

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,159
i'm ethiopian i've done a lot of content

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,159
moderation issues on ethiopia related

59
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:07,280
stuff

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
and using the platform is super

61
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,318
frustrating because we never get a

62
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,200
response

63
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,800
on the content that's reported or you

64
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
know it's delayed i've gotten a response

65
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,360
after four months the other day i had

66
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,040
even forgotten what i had reported so

67
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:19,920
that's sort of the

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,200
sort of the background that i'm coming

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,280
from so we're seeing numerous social

70
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,040
media platforms including facebook

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,800
twitter and others sort of try to go

72
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,879
globalize content moderation which you

73
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,080
know which would seem i

74
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,599
i wish my content could be treated the

75
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,200
same way as a content in the us

76
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,120
at some point but some of the problems

77
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,319
that we're seeing is that you know this

78
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,400
effort to globalize content moderation

79
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,120
um vulnerable voices dissenting voices

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,959
marginalized groups are being um

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,720
um you know silenced and censored

82
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:46,400
whether on purpose or you know

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,080
automatically we're not yet sure

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,760
um so how does twitter sort of mitigate

85
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,120
for that in the effort to

86
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,280
to sort of globalize um content

87
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,640
moderation and

88
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,000
i was just wanting to add on there as

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,680
well we've heard rumors that you know

90
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,560
twitter is

91
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,000
um sort of trying to come up with its

92
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,599
first governance for global content

93
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,720
moderation i wouldn't

94
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,680
you don't have to address that

95
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,599
particularly but how are you mitigating

96
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,200
for the risks of you know folks like

97
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,200
myself being silenced and marginalized

98
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,959
on your platforms

99
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,120
yeah thank you that's a great question i

100
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,319
think this is one of the

101
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
the long-term um issues that i'm

102
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,000
spending a lot of time trying

103
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
to understand where does this go from

104
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,200
here because i think

105
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
we definitely have challenges today i

106
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,480
think as an industry

107
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,560
content moderation and scaling that to

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,080
meet the needs of our customers around

109
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,760
the world is becoming enormously

110
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,720
difficult

111
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,760
um certainly we taking a step back

112
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,680
we're trying to protect some fundamental

113
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
human rights here right we're

114
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,040
really focused on free expression but

115
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,879
we're also focused on safety and privacy

116
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:43,440
these are all very interrelated and

117
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,280
whenever you make any sort of change to

118
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,640
your policy or enforcement you have to

119
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,000
think of all of these things and how

120
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,680
they're balancing each other

121
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
and i think one of the challenges we've

122
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,200
faced obviously in the last year

123
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,439
is also having to do this very

124
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:56,879
differently than we've had to in the

125
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:57,760
past

126
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,439
you know just to be perfectly candid

127
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:00,879
like we we had

128
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
um content moderators globally that were

129
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,799
very much affected by

130
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,040
the the global pandemic and we had to

131
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,560
make some big adjustments

132
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,000
either to how they were working where

133
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,599
they were working and

134
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,920
um it definitely you know did not allow

135
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,720
us to be

136
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,759
as um fast as we wanted to be as rea

137
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,120
as um you know as deliberate as we

138
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,839
wanted to be

139
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,520
in dealing with situations in certain

140
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,040
places around the world i think that's

141
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,560
one part of it the other part of it is

142
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,000
absolutely i'm not going to sit here and

143
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,880
tell you that our

144
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,440
capacity to do things in english is is

145
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,880
the same as it is in every other

146
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
language

147
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,040
that is something we need to work on and

148
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,919
i think part of our push as a company

149
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:41,680
to build technology hubs in the places

150
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,960
in the world where we serve our

151
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,680
customers

152
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,000
is very much focused on this issue we

153
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
cannot possibly

154
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,360
have either ranking algorithms or safety

155
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,680
algorithms that work in these places the

156
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,600
way they are intended to work

157
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,440
unless we have people coming from these

158
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,360
communities who understand the nuance

159
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,479
and the cultural

160
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,479
context who can help us build the

161
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,240
product in a way that we want it to work

162
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:04,800
so

163
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,400
i think we have a lot of work to do part

164
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,560
of this is really reaching out and being

165
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,120
in those communities and investing more

166
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,080
resources

167
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,479
um so there's there's definitely a lot

168
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:15,600
um i think

169
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:18,479
that we have to improve and it's very

170
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:19,600
much on my mind

171
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,080
but beyond that i think um as a

172
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
community we also have to grapple with

173
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,840
how to do content moderation in this

174
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,320
world

175
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,000
and i think that there's going to be

176
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,280
some really interesting conversations

177
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,720
and questions hopefully on that topic

178
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,880
too

179
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,600
yeah no i i mean i i relate like the

180
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,199
question of you know how do you how do

181
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:37,440
we

182
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,880
do content governance and you know

183
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,639
content moderation for the whole world

184
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,320
is i guess the question that you're

185
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,759
you know you're faced with every day and

186
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,280
it's super challenging there's no single

187
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
framework that that serves everyone

188
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,320
um so you know just just trying to think

189
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,080
about this how it happens in real life

190
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,919
from the background because you're ahead

191
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,160
of um you know legal policy and safety

192
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:56,639
so

193
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,000
these are the questions that i'm sure

194
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,520
you ask yourself every day so we

195
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,039
definitely want to tap into this a bit

196
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:01,680
more

197
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,960
so now looking at for instance um not

198
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,240
necessarily the lack of content

199
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
moderation but the content moderation

200
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,360
that's actually being done currently

201
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,039
so if you look at the recent case of

202
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:12,880
palestinian voices being

203
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,560
you know silenced and i will definitely

204
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,319
come out and say i know from

205
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,000
many palestinian partners twitter has

206
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,360
been the most responsive

207
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
to request so that's really appreciated

208
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,960
and that's that's super important

209
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,800
but the idea that you know what i'm

210
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,240
struggling with with the content

211
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,680
moderation work that i do is that my

212
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,280
content the content that we report is

213
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
not being taken down

214
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,479
others like palestinian voices what

215
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,000
they're struggling with is the fact that

216
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,520
their content is being

217
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,759
you know taken down in mass so how does

218
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,199
that happen what like

219
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,800
what is that technical error what does

220
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,440
that mean yeah i think in the situation

221
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,840
what we saw in palestine was obviously

222
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,720
um

223
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,319
the situation on the ground was so

224
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,080
dynamic and people were

225
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,840
jumping to twitter and other social

226
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,160
platforms to report what was happening

227
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,160
and we have a bunch of algorithms in

228
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,160
place that are meant to detect spam

229
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,199
or unusual usage of accounts that

230
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,440
you know obviously in other situations

231
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:04,880
are very good at protecting our

232
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,639
customers because there's

233
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,960
there is signals of um some sort of

234
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,240
misuse or

235
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,160
other uh behavior that we wouldn't want

236
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,520
to see on the platform

237
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,360
and in this situation those algorithms

238
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,199
were catching legitimate accounts that

239
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:17,840
that were

240
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
obviously acting in different ways

241
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,440
because of the emerging situation on the

242
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,080
ground

243
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,560
so that's very like that's an unintended

244
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,080
consequence i think that that's quite

245
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:26,639
common

246
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:30,240
and um unfortunately like i i would love

247
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,160
to tell you that we will never run into

248
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,840
these type of issues but we're always

249
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:34,639
learning

250
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:36,800
these um algorithms or even human

251
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,880
processes are meant to be

252
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:41,280
uh updated and they're meant to change

253
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
over time as we learn from our

254
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,479
situations on the ground

255
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,160
and then in this particular situation

256
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,680
it's the worst possible timing

257
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,360
for for the people on the ground

258
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,120
obviously and understand that and

259
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,840
our team was jumping in trying to fix

260
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,440
the situation but we don't always have

261
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,039
the capability of just turning something

262
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:57,599
off

263
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
in one particular area because it has

264
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,440
massive impact across

265
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,479
our platform so i know that our team was

266
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:05,599
you know trying to understand the

267
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,280
specific impacts in this case reaching

268
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,039
out to our civil society partners on the

269
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:09,840
ground

270
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,080
understanding very much who was being

271
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,919
impacted and trying to

272
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,680
undo essentially the effects that we

273
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,360
were seeing from the use of that

274
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,319
those particular um spam related or

275
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:21,759
other related algorithms

276
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
and um i i again we've learned a lot and

277
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,879
we're now going to work with our product

278
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
and engineering teams um

279
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,400
to see how we can mitigate that impact

280
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,680
from happening in the future because

281
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,958
obviously it wasn't something that we

282
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:34,399
intended or foresaw

283
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,599
um in that moment um

284
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,039
that's super interesting and i was

285
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:40,479
hoping the algorithm conversation was

286
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,919
not going to come today but

287
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:44,000
it's here um so what does that really

288
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,519
mean because i'm i'm

289
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,839
i'm trying to understand so when we say

290
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,200
you know

291
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,800
i'm assuming there's a quote that

292
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,560
somebody sat down and wrote

293
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,120
um you know that automatically you know

294
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,959
it's it's it almost seems like it's by

295
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,080
design that

296
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
you know it's not able to tell that you

297
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,839
know the realities of palestinians is it

298
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:02,399
that

299
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
you know um it's designed to block

300
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,760
filter sensor content that's

301
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,600
particularly related to these situations

302
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,080
like

303
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,760
how would you how would you explain our

304
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
goal algorithm because we can't just

305
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,480
reach the algorithm and leave it like

306
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,040
that

307
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,720
so somebody must have written it right

308
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,240
like somebody sat there

309
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
thought about it how does how does that

310
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,760
work so if you think if you take a step

311
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
back

312
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
we have a lot of um algorithms that are

313
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,560
attempting to detect

314
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,040
inauthentic behavior so this is um

315
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,399
spam-like behavior

316
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,440
bots fake accounts and these accounts

317
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,320
behave in certain ways right either in

318
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:34,959
terms of

319
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
how much they're treating or who they're

320
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,880
tweeting to or how they're engaging

321
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,800
or the fact that they will suddenly

322
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,080
start doing something

323
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,120
and so we have um i guess

324
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,720
detection mechanisms these are the

325
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
algorithms that are looking for this

326
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,399
type of behavior

327
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,959
it's not coded to content it's not code

328
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,480
i mean we have some that are obviously

329
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,000
coded to content but in this situation

330
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,360
it was about behavior looking at

331
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,640
behavior models

332
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,240
and what these algorithms do is they

333
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,480
won't often just directly

334
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,800
um say like this account is gone but

335
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,519
they will put

336
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,200
uh they will put some challenges in

337
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,320
front of the account to make sure

338
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,240
they're human as an example so will be

339
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,279
some sort of

340
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,680
authentication mechanism to you know

341
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,519
provide an email address a phone number

342
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,360
do some sort of recaptcha

343
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,519
and this is all intended again you know

344
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,200
for the safety of the whole platform

345
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,959
but in any individual case we can be

346
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:25,120
making errors and stopping someone from

347
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,720
accessing the system as quickly as they

348
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:27,519
need to

349
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
so it's not that this was an algorithm

350
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:31,279
put in place for palestine

351
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,200
um or for the situation these are

352
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,279
long-standing behavior-based

353
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,959
algorithms are looking for certain types

354
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,680
of behavior that in our experience in

355
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,720
the past

356
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,440
have been inauthentic or fake or

357
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,079
bot-like

358
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,200
or automated and in you know they're not

359
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:48,160
going to be 100

360
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,160
accurate and in certain situations the

361
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,440
behaviors are going to mimic something

362
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,240
that's happening

363
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,440
and that isn't bad and the algorithm is

364
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,279
going to detect it as bad and make take

365
00:10:57,279 --> 00:10:58,160
action on it

366
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
so i think that's the closest

367
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,200
explanation i can give to this

368
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,279
particular situation it wasn't um that

369
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,079
we put in some

370
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,480
something in place for uh what we were

371
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,079
seeing in palestine these were things

372
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:09,279
that we had already had in place that

373
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,560
were operating globally

374
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,160
which is also why it's not really

375
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,839
possible for us to just disable this

376
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
algorithm because it does have

377
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,279
important functions that it's serving in

378
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,040
other parts of the world it's just not

379
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,360
particularly working in this moment for

380
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,959
this and we have learnings to

381
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:24,880
to understand how to improve and fix

382
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,160
that in the future

383
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,800
um thank you for that um so sort of that

384
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,760
that brings up

385
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,920
you know issues of for instance uh when

386
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,519
mass rallies are organized in different

387
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,440
places we don't see that sort of um

388
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,800
action from you guy you know from

389
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,480
twitter uh blocking

390
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,399
um you know whether it's protests you

391
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
know in the us or you know

392
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
in the uk or other places so maybe

393
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:47,600
contextualizing to that need and knowing

394
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,360
that these protests are coming might

395
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:50,880
potentially help but i'll make sure that

396
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,560
i move us to um sort of the next

397
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,600
question of

398
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,320
uh we know that numerous governments are

399
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:56,720
at

400
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,880
an as another mean great really uh

401
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,560
trying to regulate

402
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
big tech i know you guys have been busy

403
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,480
with blockings in nigeria

404
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,279
blocked you know your colleagues and you

405
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,399
know

406
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,120
content content uh government's trying

407
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,200
to sort of regulate content online

408
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,360
which is not always the best uh job for

409
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,880
governments to do demanding physical

410
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,800
presence of individuals and companies

411
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,959
you know intimidation of your employees

412
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:22,800
and your other social media employees

413
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,720
as well being intimidated so it's a

414
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,639
really difficult time uh to be

415
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:29,440
uh running policy legal and safety at

416
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,000
any

417
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,480
content hosting company content posting

418
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,279
hump you know

419
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,120
all of those things so first question

420
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,399
for you is you know how are you trying

421
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,079
to balance between the market

422
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,160
interest um and freedom of expression

423
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,040
privacy and safety of its users

424
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,839
yeah i would just like to say like um is

425
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,519
a tough time to be a company but it's

426
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:48,800
always been a tough time to be an

427
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:49,920
activist so

428
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,160
i don't think that um what what we're

429
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,920
facing today is probably a very small

430
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,519
fraction of what many of you see

431
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,639
day to day and um you know we're we're

432
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,079
um humbled to to be able to

433
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,160
fight for things that we believe in as a

434
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:05,920
company whether it's free expression or

435
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,760
privacy or safety

436
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,440
and i think the important thing for us

437
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,040
as we're making some of these decisions

438
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,160
to

439
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,040
either enter markets is severely be as

440
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,560
transparent as we can be

441
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,160
um for us there's a lot of

442
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,360
accountability that comes from

443
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,160
transparency

444
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,240
that's why our systems are designed the

445
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,360
way they are

446
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,760
we still process government legal

447
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:27,839
requests and publish them publicly

448
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,880
on a third party site through lumen we

449
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,639
think that transparency is important

450
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,040
we provide user notice when we get these

451
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:35,920
requests

452
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,680
to the extent that we can that's

453
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,760
obviously really important

454
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,880
but this is definitely a big challenge

455
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,160
for all companies and i think one of the

456
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,839
things that i have found to be really

457
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:49,279
interesting is there is this

458
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,120
debate that's happening about the role

459
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,600
of corporations power of corporations

460
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,120
um in these very governance-like matters

461
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,079
and one of the arguments we we get or

462
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,959
one of the

463
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,800
pushbacks that we see when we're

464
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,480
advocating for free expression in

465
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,240
in different markets is that you know

466
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,839
we're a corporation what do we really

467
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:08,240
care

468
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,360
about people and um you know our voice

469
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,160
is not as

470
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,079
influential in a lot of these

471
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,399
discussions as i would like them to be

472
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,399
because people feel that we're not um

473
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:19,680
the right um

474
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,839
i guess voice or the right champion for

475
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,360
some of these causes so

476
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,279
i think the other thing that's really

477
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,480
important for me here

478
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,720
is to have a really strong partnership

479
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,079
with civil society

480
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:32,399
because uh your voices representing the

481
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,839
actual citizens in many of these

482
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,480
countries

483
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,800
are going to be much more influential um

484
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,720
i think than our voices as

485
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,279
a corporation and and that seen as an

486
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:42,839
american corporation in a lot of these

487
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
situations

488
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,399
um yeah i wish in reality that was that

489
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:49,440
was true i wish

490
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,040
our voices were much more powerful than

491
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,800
you know multi-billion dollar

492
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,639
corporations like you guys but

493
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:57,360
um so

494
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,839
a hit on that like it's not the power i

495
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,360
appreciate like in a lot of these

496
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,199
markets that civil society groups have

497
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,480
very little power

498
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,839
but one of the things the government

499
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,600
cannot say to you is you're not you

500
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:10,079
don't belong to us like you're not of us

501
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,760
whereas we get that argument a lot right

502
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,600
like what do you know about what the

503
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,040
people of this country need

504
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
like you're you don't represent us you

505
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,639
represent some other constituent

506
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:20,000
and i think that's why it's important to

507
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,839
have this as a partnership because we do

508
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:22,720
have

509
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,480
influence we have some leverage right

510
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,399
like we it's not that we have none

511
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,720
and we can and we are trying to use that

512
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,000
to advocate for free

513
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,440
free and open internet that's the most

514
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,199
important thing that we

515
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,120
do i mean that's fundamentally the

516
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,480
purpose of twitter is to

517
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,720
to have uh to provide a space for a

518
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,560
public conversation we can't possibly do

519
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,160
that globally unless there's a free and

520
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:42,880
open internet

521
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,560
so we're going to use that leverage and

522
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,560
that power to advocate for those things

523
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,000
but us doing that without the

524
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,839
partnership of civil society i think is

525
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,040
going to be really

526
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:54,160
meaningless um

527
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,480
true i couldn't agree more i think uh

528
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:58,240
definitely civil society definitely does

529
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:58,880
play

530
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,880
a role so this so just in terms of going

531
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,399
back to this idea of you know the open

532
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:04,240
internet and what you advocate for

533
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:06,240
what we're seeing for instance in india

534
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,920
um currently uh you know the challenge

535
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,440
that twitter and other social media

536
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,440
platforms are having is

537
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,199
is quite concerning so twitter hasn't

538
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,120
been indicated numerous times that it

539
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,480
receives government requests that are

540
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,160
unlawful beyond the country's right

541
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,120
framework

542
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,399
i know um and there's there's a lot of

543
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,079
you know dangerous precedence being said

544
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,680
in other asian countries that we're also

545
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:27,279
really worried about happening in india

546
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,079
so

547
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:29,839
uh when are you guys gonna really you

548
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:31,120
know walk the talk on this issue and

549
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,639
really go to court in india

550
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,360
and and tell the government to back off

551
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,399
well i think we are

552
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,480
walking the talk i mean if you look at

553
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:40,160
um you know we've

554
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,320
we've declined there are a number of

555
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,199
orders that

556
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:45,680
you know we've been very um open with

557
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
that we don't agree that we think that

558
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
um they violate indian law as well as

559
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,600
international law

560
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:54,560
and that they're you know uh targeting

561
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:55,040
um

562
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:57,600
very particular um activists or

563
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,560
journalists

564
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,839
or opposition political parties and

565
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,920
we feel that they aren't in compliance

566
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,280
with indian law so

567
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,959
i think we are and we those those

568
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,480
accounts and those tweets um

569
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,439
in many instances remain on the platform

570
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:11,839
um

571
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:15,839
so obviously it's a very delicate um uh

572
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,480
balance to draw of when you want to

573
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,919
actually be in a court

574
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,799
versus when you want to negotiate and

575
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,280
try to

576
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,839
you know really make sure that the

577
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,440
government understands the perspective

578
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,720
that you're bringing

579
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,720
because i do think you can lose a lot of

580
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,840
control when you

581
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,080
end up in the litigation um you

582
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:36,960
certainly don't

583
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,960
have um you don't know what's going to

584
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,000
happen and

585
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,960
i think that that's one of the

586
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,480
challenges is you know stepping back and

587
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,840
looking at this from a purely legal

588
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,360
perspective is

589
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,360
litigation is one tool and it's not

590
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,880
always the best tool it's a very blunt

591
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,520
tool

592
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,360
and you don't if you don't know the

593
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,960
outcome you can be taking some pretty

594
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,760
big risks

595
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,760
with your enforcement and your policy

596
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,000
and i think what we're trying to do

597
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,440
is make sure that we we have the

598
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,320
flexibility um to continue to

599
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,160
operate in the market continue to

600
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,440
enforce our rights

601
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,600
um and the rights of the people using

602
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:08,559
our service

603
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,240
and do that in a way that gives us the

604
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,679
maximum flexibility

605
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:13,919
of course if it comes to it we're not

606
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:15,840
going to hesitate to make sure that

607
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,400
that um we enforce that in a way that um

608
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,760
we have to but we still feel like

609
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,000
there's room to really understand

610
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,000
um the various positions here and come

611
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,200
to perhaps

612
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,840
an understanding on some of these issues

613
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,440
and i think the most important thing is

614
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,960
here is an open dialogue because if you

615
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,640
don't have any dialogue at all

616
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,200
there's not a mechanism even for

617
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,400
advocating for the things that are

618
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,039
important to us

619
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,320
yeah thank you for that so um you know

620
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,080
what does that conversation and you know

621
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:44,799
um

622
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:46,320
negotiation with the government look

623
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,080
like so um would you

624
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,679
um does that come at the cost of you

625
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,600
know losing um um

626
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,679
to that as a market because that's you

627
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,160
uh you know india as a market is not i'm

628
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,520
assuming you guys would not want to lose

629
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,960
in the other market so

630
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,720
uh if you're not going to court and if

631
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,160
you're going to sort of negotiate and

632
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:03,600
try to see what is workable with the

633
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,120
government that means that comes at the

634
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,080
expense of

635
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,640
you know marginalized voices you know

636
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,240
women and minority groups

637
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,160
um and you know freedom of expression

638
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,919
privacy and all of those things so

639
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,160
that that really is like creates a lot

640
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,679
of anxiety amongst many of the

641
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,120
marginalized groups that are in india

642
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,640
that are fighting um you know

643
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
the government on many levels so what

644
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,520
does that what does that negotiation

645
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,120
look like

646
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,000
well look i think part of this is um

647
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,520
making sure the government itself is

648
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,960
understanding what they're asking for

649
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:31,440
because

650
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,160
in a lot of instances you have um you

651
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,640
know

652
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,480
people who might be enforcing a

653
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,000
particular law in a particular

654
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,200
way but that may not be necessarily

655
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,559
what someone more senior in the

656
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
government is understanding what's

657
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:44,960
happening

658
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,039
or really informed about how that's

659
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,000
happening so it

660
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,400
on some level it is purely an education

661
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,320
like are you aware that this is the

662
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:54,720
nature of these orders are you aware

663
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,679
that this is

664
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:58,320
um the the groups that it happens to be

665
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,120
targeting

666
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,600
um can you give us more information on

667
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,480
why

668
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,200
this is um not only a violation of our

669
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,080
rules but

670
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,679
why you think it's a violation of indian

671
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,240
law like engaging in that conversation

672
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,720
has resulted in many instances around

673
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,440
the world

674
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:17,120
of governments understanding like or

675
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:19,600
admitting like that wasn't the intention

676
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,159
or

677
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,080
you know pulling back in in particular

678
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,200
ways and

679
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:26,240
i think calling a spotlight or putting a

680
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,840
spotlight on these issues

681
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,760
and making sure people really understand

682
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,440
our governments really understand

683
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,679
um how their laws are being interpreted

684
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:35,840
and enforced in particular situations

685
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,120
can be really important

686
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,280
i agree i share with you the concern

687
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,400
that there is no

688
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,799
easy path here there is no path where we

689
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:43,440
can do

690
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,720
everything that we want without

691
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,240
understanding government interests or

692
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,640
civil society interests i wish that

693
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,760
there was something

694
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,159
easier for us to do but i think we're

695
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:53,919
also balancing

696
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:57,440
wanting to be available for the people

697
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,520
that use our service in these markets

698
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,720
with

699
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,640
free expression rights with privacy

700
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,840
rights and so

701
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,760
these are enormous challenges not just

702
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,840
for us but for the open internet

703
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,080
and i i think it's we're going to see a

704
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,440
lot of changes and i think

705
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:14,320
this regulation of social platforms by

706
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,120
the government is

707
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,840
really going to push the industry in a

708
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,120
very different direction

709
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,080
of more decentralization and this is i

710
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,400
think

711
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,559
going to be largely better for a lot of

712
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,480
activists for a lot of people

713
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,640
but it represents a whole new set of

714
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,760
challenges that we're going to have to

715
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:30,880
grapple with

716
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,720
when we move to perhaps a more

717
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:34,240
decentralized internet

718
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,840
once again because obviously

719
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,720
centralizing a lot of these points

720
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,400
with companies like us is going to

721
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,840
create a lot of problems for a lot of

722
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,440
people and it gives governments

723
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,360
um venues to figure out how to regulate

724
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,120
and control the internet in ways that

725
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,480
perhaps they couldn't if it were more

726
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,280
decentralized

727
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,360
um okay so and now going back to this

728
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,400
issue of you know um

729
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,320
you're facing challenged in in india and

730
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,760
then now if we come to countries like

731
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,760
nigeria where uh you know last week

732
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,720
or this week it's been a long week

733
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,320
twitter was blocked

734
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,480
um and you know there were many

735
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,159
justifications the government gave for

736
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,280
why twitter um

737
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,280
was blocked we're seeing you know year

738
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,640
after year government's shutting down

739
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,440
the internet

740
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:16,960
blocking filtering throttling social

741
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:19,039
media and you know of course twitter has

742
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,720
been i'm sort of at the front of this

743
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,840
and you know i definitely want to

744
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,520
commend your policy team for

745
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
you know coming out and you know having

746
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,880
a policy and working with the keep it on

747
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,400
team and with the accessnow team and

748
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,240
particularly on shutdowns

749
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,320
um so one question that i know that team

750
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,000
has is you know that's twitter plan to

751
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,360
include blocking and filtering

752
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:36,559
information

753
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:40,159
in your transparency reports

754
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:42,559
you know we would love to to be able to

755
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:43,440
do that i think

756
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,840
um there are some technical challenges

757
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,520
with us being able to do that in the

758
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,240
sense that

759
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,440
we don't always know what's happening um

760
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,679
just because we are seeing lower traffic

761
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,720
or

762
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
some issues with access that can be a

763
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,400
bug it could be

764
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,240
you know other bandwidth related

765
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,559
problems so part of the struggle for

766
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,159
us is just making sure that we have

767
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,559
accurate data but if we felt that we had

768
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:07,360
accurate data

769
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,200
i would love to be able to do that i

770
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,679
mean in many instances i think these are

771
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:13,360
largely public anyway so being able to

772
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,720
consolidate and show this

773
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,120
in one place i think is important but

774
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,559
you know what we've seen is like we

775
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:19,760
don't often know

776
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,200
when a government is throttling our

777
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,679
service and um or we can't prove it

778
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,840
and that that's a difficult part of the

779
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,720
transparency here

780
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,200
uh okay i know definitely that keep it

781
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:32,640
on team would definitely would want to

782
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,679
work with you on that

783
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,760
um that's what they do with other social

784
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,280
media platforms as well

785
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
so it's in terms of verifying you know

786
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,799
figuring out if it actually has been

787
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,919
blocked so

788
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,600
um i'm sure they're listening and we'll

789
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,919
definitely will definitely reach out

790
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,120
um so um i know we have about like seven

791
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,600
minutes

792
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,919
left so um i want to ask this question

793
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,600
of um

794
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,840
um so yesterday there was a bunch of

795
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,960
people having a conversation about

796
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,080
content moderation

797
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,320
on on twitter and other platforms and

798
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:02,240
you know what has significantly come out

799
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,840
is how we you know that are termed in

800
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,480
the global south are

801
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,760
disproportionately um you know treated

802
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,679
differently than the rest of the world

803
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:14,000
uh in terms of the way that content is

804
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,840
reported in terms of you know

805
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,840
how the company responds for instance i

806
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,200
know you have uh

807
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,120
one individual in your policy team for

808
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,559
sub-saharan africa

809
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,880
um i don't know if you've hired more but

810
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:25,840
at least that you know

811
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,279
we're very happy that at least that one

812
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,880
individual is there now

813
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,480
uh well compared to what you have in the

814
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,799
u.s compared to what you have in

815
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,760
in europe and even in asia so um i

816
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,279
definitely have always this feeling that

817
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:38,559
we're an afterthought

818
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,000
and you know maybe that one in terms of

819
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,760
market we're not valuable right now but

820
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,240
in the next few years you know

821
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
we're gonna be where the market is

822
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,960
because of just how many people are

823
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,000
being connected

824
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,159
to the internet so um how would you

825
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,760
respond to that from a policy point of

826
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,320
view

827
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,480
um you know i i know that the features

828
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:55,760
that are available for instance in the

829
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,520
uk when you're reporting content are not

830
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,880
available in nigeria

831
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,799
uh the features that you're reporting on

832
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:02,640
in content in ethiopia are not available

833
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:03,760
um you know um

834
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,919
in other places so how how do you see

835
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:07,440
that are we and are an afterthought when

836
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,799
it comes to policy

837
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:12,159
or we're always on your mind uh well i'm

838
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:13,840
i'm not sure what you mean by the

839
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,760
features available in the uk are not

840
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,400
available

841
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,919
in nigeria so that that's that's

842
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,600
surprising to me so i want to

843
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
make sure that i follow up on that as i

844
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,360
i think we were talking about before we

845
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,640
got on the screen one of the

846
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,640
great things for me about um coming to

847
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,559
ridescon every year is is

848
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,880
the learnings that we have in terms of

849
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,000
um how we can

850
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,919
do better so i want to make sure i

851
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:35,200
understand that in a little bit more

852
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:35,840
detail

853
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,760
look i don't think any any market is an

854
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,440
afterthought for us um

855
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,600
certainly our investment needs to be

856
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,640
different and better

857
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,440
all around the world um you know where

858
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:45,919
we

859
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,039
i think you're referring to public

860
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,480
policy when you say we have one

861
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,600
sub-saharan

862
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,559
person we generally have um you know our

863
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:53,760
policy folks um

864
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,520
located in places where we have offices

865
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,520
we're just opening our first presence

866
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,880
in um africa so it's it's not a an issue

867
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:01,440
of

868
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,120
what's important or not important it's

869
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:04,720
just this is we we

870
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,200
haven't had an office um represented in

871
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,159
africa which is

872
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,960
obviously a huge um an exciting thing

873
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,760
for us

874
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
we really hope that this represents to

875
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,039
the market our

876
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,600
investment and interest in doing this

877
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,159
right

878
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:20,880
um and bringing more resources in terms

879
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,880
of content moderation in terms of safety

880
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,400
in terms of understanding the needs of

881
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:26,080
the market in a much more granular way

882
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:27,360
than we have before

883
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,080
so um i would say that like part of this

884
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:30,480
is

885
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:33,600
is really um being open to like doing

886
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,960
things differently than we have we've

887
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,880
had a very centralized model

888
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
in san francisco for a large part of

889
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,080
time

890
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:42,480
um our ceo jack dorsey has told us like

891
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,559
we cannot possibly serve the customers

892
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,320
that we want to serve globally unless we

893
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,000
are with them and and from

894
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,760
you know represented by them and like

895
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,279
they are part of our company

896
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,200
and that's why we have this big push as

897
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,039
a company to be decentralized

898
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
to be located and the markets have

899
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,880
employees representing

900
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,559
the regions in the world where we want

901
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,960
um or we have customers so

902
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,559
that's one of the most important things

903
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,400
that we can do is actually continue our

904
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,360
investment here

905
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,880
and make sure that we're understanding

906
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,120
the very specific needs of all of these

907
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,240
places because

908
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,640
we're not we're not going to be able to

909
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,200
do any sort of effective job

910
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,360
in either our policy or our enforcement

911
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,799
unless we have the perspective that we

912
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:21,520
need from

913
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:23,520
from all of you from the markets we

914
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,159
serve so that is that is a big challenge

915
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,279
and i would love to

916
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,919
have more resources trust me if i if i

917
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,039
could but we do

918
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:34,159
as much as i think um the reality is

919
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:36,159
as much as the the view is that we have

920
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:38,000
unlimited resources we just don't and we

921
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,600
often are having to make um

922
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,000
some challenging choices but i would say

923
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,919
that like africa in particular right now

924
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:44,480
is

925
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,000
is one of the areas where we're

926
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:47,840
investing a lot and we want to make sure

927
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,399
that we

928
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:51,039
um as a on my side on my policy and

929
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:51,760
trust

930
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,080
side that we're investing effectively to

931
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,120
match the

932
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,320
what we're seeing in the product and

933
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,480
engineering side right now

934
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,320
okay thank you for that um i know we

935
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,159
have only about like two minutes so

936
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:03,760
not a fair question but you know what

937
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,120
does the future look like from where

938
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,559
you're sitting

939
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,480
oh i kind of hit on this earlier which

940
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,120
um look i think we've seen this great um

941
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:11,600
shift

942
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,679
right uh if you think back to the advent

943
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,039
of social media

944
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:18,399
10 15 years ago so much power in

945
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
in how people were able to use it to

946
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:21,679
disrupt

947
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,080
traditional power structures and what

948
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
you've seen in the intervening time

949
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,200
as governments and others kind of trying

950
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,000
to take that power

951
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,480
back using various mechanisms whether it

952
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,760
is

953
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,960
a regulation or getting more savvy

954
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,320
themselves about how to use

955
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,760
um social platforms or in some cases in

956
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,279
some parts of the world manipulating

957
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:44,559
social platforms

958
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
um through operations or like to really

959
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:50,399
um you know take back some of that

960
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:51,600
control that they've lost

961
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,279
and so um what you're seeing now is that

962
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,039
state which is governments and

963
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:59,440
others taking back that control and um

964
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:00,559
often at the cost

965
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:03,600
of our activists and um

966
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,320
you know people in markets and i i think

967
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,279
what we're gonna see

968
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:09,279
is a push towards more decentralization

969
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:11,520
because centralized platforms are not

970
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,559
serving the needs um in many instances

971
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:17,440
of uh you know uh particular groups or

972
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:18,240
particular

973
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,600
um uh particular voices in in different

974
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,799
parts of the world so

975
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,360
this is what we are we are anticipating

976
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
is a push to decentralization

977
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,159
we're very much focused on this um in

978
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,200
terms of

979
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,799
trying to be a part of this change

980
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:34,559
versus stopping it we want to

981
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:39,200
enable this so we're pushing to set up a

982
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,440
decentralized open social protocol we

983
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,520
call this project blue sky

984
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:45,039
um we think that this has a lot of

985
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:47,200
promising um

986
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,880
promising aspects to it we're not sure

987
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,399
exactly how it will

988
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,480
play out over the next you know three

989
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,000
five seven years

990
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,080
but we do think that there is something

991
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:58,000
about decentralization

992
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,080
um that is going to be very important

993
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,679
and powerful as we kind of um

994
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,320
enter kind of whatever the next state of

995
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,600
social and social media is

996
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,279
okay that's that's really good to hear i

997
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:10,640
hope you know this this

998
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,880
um as as we're experimenting as we're

999
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,679
trying to figure out

1000
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,919
what a decentralized internet looks like

1001
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:16,960
you know there's

1002
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:20,000
um good impact assessment on how you

1003
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,320
know

1004
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:21,520
human rights will be affected how

1005
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,960
freedom of expression will be affected

1006
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:23,440
how

1007
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,279
folks like myself and palestinians you

1008
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:27,039
know dilated women and many others that

1009
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:28,799
are at the margins and at the front

1010
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,120
front front of this conversation are are

1011
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,399
going to be impacted

1012
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,720
i think the success of uh you know your

1013
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,039
platform is really giving voices to the

1014
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:37,840

1015
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,760
in many ways to many of us when we were

due diligence and attention
