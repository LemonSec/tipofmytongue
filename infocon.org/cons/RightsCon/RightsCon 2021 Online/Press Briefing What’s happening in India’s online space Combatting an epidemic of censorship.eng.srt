reiterate international

72
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,840
actors tracking free expression privacy

73
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,120
and other protected rights are very

74
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,280
concerned that the limits in india so

75
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,520
14 organizations access now and 13

76
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
others joined together

77
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:29,680
to issue a joint position indicating

78
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,319
that we

79
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,680
believe that the current developments in

80
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
india both the moves towards

81
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,200
censoring content putting pressure on

82
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,720
platforms to take down

83
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,879
content and to be able to process user

84
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,440
requests and more recently moves to

85
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,080
create

86
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,640
a significantly draconian regulatory

87
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,160
framework for online speech

88
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,319
under the i.t rules issued under the

89
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
information technology act in february

90
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
2021 are likely to result in an

91
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,720
increasingly hostile environment for

92
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,160
free speech online

93
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,080
not just on tech platforms including

94
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
intermediaries social media platforms

95
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,800
and messaging

96
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,879
services but also digital news services

97
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,720
that are regulated by a completely

98
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,000
unlawful mechanism

99
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,599
under these rules as well as new

100
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:09,040
mandates towards streaming video

101
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,239
services and others

102
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:11,680
we therefore have called upon the

103
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,280
government to suspend the implementation

104
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,239
of these rules

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,879
and to in fact review them undertaking

106
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,519
sustain

107
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,920
and meaningful public consultation with

108
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:20,959
full participation

109
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:22,640
we believe all website blocking orders

110
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:23,920
that the government of india is showing

111
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,480
must be

112
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,760
made available in the public domain

113
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,360
which they are currently not and that

114
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,640
they should also commit to

115
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,720
not curtailing free speech expression

116
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,400
the right to association and privacy

117
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,360
online

118
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,640
we also believe they are important

119
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,560
measures that technology companies

120
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,640
and platforms operating in india must

121
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,319
take which is they must uphold human

122
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,159
rights responsibilities and mitigate any

123
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,920
human rights harming mandates from the

124
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:44,879
government of india

125
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,480
they must prioritize user rights and

126
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,480
challenge any unlawful

127
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,400
demands by authorities you must

128
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,920
implement effective measures to protect

129
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,720
privacy

130
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,640
free expression and security and more

131
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
importantly they must ensure that they

132
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:56,879
follow

133
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:59,519
proper due procedure under law including

134
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:00,000
international

135
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,760
human rights law standards when it comes

136
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,959
to assessing any requests from

137
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,640
government agencies they must not be

138
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,280
complicit

139
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,200
in censorship and they must step up and

140
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,720
we believe these urgent actions that

141
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,400
both the private and public sectors in

142
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:10,879
india

143
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
must take

144
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,720
thanks ramon um david i'm going to hand

145
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
it over to you first

146
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,358
great thank you so much for for having

147
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,440
me this morning

148
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:26,000
um you know i want to just and i'm sorry

149
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,360
that i can only stay for

150
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,639
a few moments um and i want to

151
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,000
start by by noting that it was

152
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,360
um it was just about six years ago

153
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
in the shreya singal case that the

154
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,400
supreme court of india

155
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,440
really came to a conclusion that

156
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,600
that was rooted in basic freedom of

157
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,280
expression standards

158
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
in evaluating indian law

159
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
and the possibility of censorship

160
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,000
and i want to start there because i

161
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,160
think it's important to recognize

162
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,759
that in both the indian constitution

163
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
and more broadly in in

164
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,160
indian law you know pre-dating

165
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,560
the modi government let's say there were

166
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,160
strong indications

167
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,600
that india was on a path for creating

168
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,880
um a kind of framework for

169
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,639
the evaluation of regulation

170
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,280
in india that was rooted in basic rule

171
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,960
of law standards

172
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,360
and i think it's useful to start there

173
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
in part because

174
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,160
that was actually a case that was

175
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
decided during

176
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,440
during a rights con uh in manila the

177
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,639
philippines um

178
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,039
six years ago i remember the the kind of

179
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,000
joy

180
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,880
that people were experiencing at that

181
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,000
rights con

182
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
um but it's useful to start there i

183
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,520
think because

184
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,320
it highlights how far india has come in

185
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
the last several years

186
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,759
and and i think the statement that was

187
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,759
released highlights

188
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,120
just that distance that has been

189
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,080
traveled by india and by this government

190
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:06,960
but um

191
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
but it's also important to highlight a

192
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,880
couple of those changes and at least the

193
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,479
themes of those changes

194
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,360
so one you can you can go back several

195
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,240
years

196
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
to um well not several just a couple of

197
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,319
years to

198
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,319
the way in which india responded to

199
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,960
to advocacy uh to um to protest

200
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,759
and to its own decision making with

201
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,080
respect to kashmir

202
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,600
where the indian government took not

203
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:41,039
just a kind of modest regulatory step

204
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
to deal with the internet but actually

205
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,520
shut down communications

206
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,720
across the region a couple of years ago

207
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,759
and expanded its shutdown

208
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,840
and slowdown eventually of the internet

209
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,360
in in kashmir really for purposes

210
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,160
of limiting communication limiting

211
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,599
freedom of expression

212
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
limiting the ability of people to

213
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,599
communicate both within and without

214
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
a cashmere the other kinds of

215
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,080
issues that we've seen in the last

216
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,160
couple of years are perfectly within

217
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,160
that space of thinking of

218
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,280
protest and expression as things that

219
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,000
have to be

220
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,720
censored rather than integrated into

221
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,400
public policy debate

222
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,960
and so we see that not just in the

223
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:27,919
response

224
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,160
to kashmir but the response to the

225
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
farmer's protests

226
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,199
we see that in the way in which uh the

227
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,680
government has responded to criticism

228
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,880
of its kovid 19 policies

229
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,000
we see that in the near

230
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,360
um total lack of transparency

231
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,039
around government demands to

232
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,080
platforms and to individuals to

233
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,080
restrict content across the board uh

234
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:58,639
over

235
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,319
the last several months leading to

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
really absurd situations where

237
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,400
specific posts that are merely critical

238
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,520
of government

239
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,120
have been taken down in really secretive

240
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,479
kinds of orders

241
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,960
issued by the government against twitter

242
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,680
facebook

243
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
other platforms and also of course

244
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,120
in the broader sense to attacks on

245
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,479
individuals um and that is legal attacks

246
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,280
often

247
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,599
bringing cases against individuals for

248
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,880
their expression

249
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,519
in the country so i think that as we

250
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
think about what's happening in india

251
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:37,679
and i

252
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,640
i really defer to the expertise of

253
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,159
others on the panel as to what is

254
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,719
happening

255
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,839
on the ground with respect to specific

256
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,600
regulatory moves

257
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,399
and with respect to the particular kinds

258
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,399
of pressures that people are facing

259
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
i think it's useful to put the the

260
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,959
situation into this broader

261
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,160
set of trends of recent years

262
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,880
of really diminishing respect for

263
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,000
freedom of expression

264
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,120
after a very um

265
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
kind of model kind of baseline

266
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,519
that the indian supreme court had uh had

267
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,959
originally stated

268
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,000
just six years ago so i'll stop there

269
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,240
and thank everyone for their patience

270
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,279
with me and

271
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,440
my apologies for having to uh to leave

272
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
so quickly

273
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,200
thank you thanks david um gaia would you

274
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,920
like to talk a little bit more about the

275
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,880
context

276
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
yeah um thank you david thank you ria

277
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,800
um i think um the way we could possibly

278
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,880
go about it is to first sort of figure

279
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,399
out the context because

280
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,080
we are discussing about online

281
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,839
censorship at a time when the second

282
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,440
wave of the pandemic

283
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
has affected the lives of millions

284
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,360
across the length and breadth of

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,240
of my country right uh broken hearts and

286
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,959
families

287
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,800
are still trying to piece their lives

288
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:04,160
back together

289
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,959
the extent of reliance or over-reliance

290
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,519
on digital technologies at this time has

291
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,200
been apparent

292
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,440
india is one of the few if not the only

293
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,160
country to have exclusively relied on

294
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,800
digital technology for vaccine delivery

295
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,399
and to a great extent even for

296
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,240
information dissemination

297
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,399
um the effects of that are open for us

298
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:25,839
to understand and

299
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,120
decipher what we will from social media

300
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,640
and and digital

301
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,480
tools have thus become sort of

302
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,480
unwillingly or willingly

303
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
central to our lives at a moment when

304
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,279
the digital divide is so vast

305
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,560
the pandemic has unfortunately also

306
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,200
made way for a steep increase or

307
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,079
normalization

308
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:47,839
of violation of freedom of expression

309
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,399
and opinion um there are two specific

310
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,440
problems

311
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,079
one is the targeting of speech of users

312
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,680
and another is the targeting of

313
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,640
platforms

314
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,680
including digital uh news platforms or

315
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,560
portals

316
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,120
um this has been made possible not only

317
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,800
through existing legislation

318
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
both offline and online specific ones

319
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,160
but also through the enactment

320
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,959
of new legislation or rules but what i

321
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,640
will do is i'll try and focus on the

322
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
users because the other speakers will be

323
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
in a better position

324
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,600
to talk about the private sector and the

325
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,839
impact of this in the private sector

326
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:24,959
um as noted in a report by article 14

327
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,839
that has been

328
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,839
sort of a significant rise in the number

329
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,480
of sedition cases in the last decade

330
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,600
and more specifically since 2014

331
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,839
this relates not only to online content

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
but also offline content

333
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,480
this increase has been specifically

334
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,200
noted

335
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,839
around the historic anti-ca the

336
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,160
citizenship amendment act protest

337
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,839
as well as the farmer's protest

338
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,560
including other important moments

339
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,320
a lot of this has to do with content

340
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,079
that is critical of the government its

341
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:54,959
policies

342
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,120
speech against political entities or

343
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,079
personnel

344
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,560
and also speech that is oddly deemed as

345
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,000
anti-national

346
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,240
the constitutional validity of this very

347
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
provision that is used to charge

348
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,440
individuals for sedition

349
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
is currently being challenged and we'd

350
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,560
have to wait to see

351
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,120
the outcome of that but moving to

352
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:15,120
content that is specific to online

353
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,000
spaces

354
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,440
the kinds of censorship we are

355
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,399
witnessing includes charges for content

356
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:23,279
or a posts relating um or other posts

357
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:24,480
that are either written

358
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,959
or even artistic that is critical of the

359
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:27,680
government

360
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,600
and more recently critical of the

361
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,200
government's management of the corbett

362
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,079
crisis

363
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:34,399
in some cases including the state of uh

364
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:35,600
uttar pradesh

365
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,320
seizure of property is being propounded

366
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,000
for engaging in such

367
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,279
speech so-called fake speech um as

368
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,200
has been discussed in many panels even

369
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,880
during writescon there is very little

370
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,639
transparency around

371
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,279
data to understand take down requests or

372
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,200
how these arrests are done

373
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,839
um for instance recently instagram took

374
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
down several accounts and messages

375
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,880
relating to

376
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,519
relief work around covid which was later

377
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,240
termed as

378
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,040
issues with automation or a glitch this

379
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,440
only confirms uh our fears around over

380
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,120
reliance on automation

381
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:11,200
now facebook had taken down several

382
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,560
accounts and content

383
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,720
including that of a poet who was

384
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,399
critical of the prime minister

385
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,200
uh temporarily hashtag resign modi was

386
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,000
blocked

387
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,880
which too was termed as a mistake now

388
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,279
recent findings of the oversight board

389
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,240
of facebook

390
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,480
relating to a content that claimed

391
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,800
genocide of farmers

392
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,120
was which was subsequently restored was

393
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,240
also claimed to be an

394
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,200
error right all this points to over

395
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,160
censorship

396
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,000
coming from different quarters and not

397
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,279
only the government

398
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,360
but before all this a slew of accounts

399
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,959
were ordered to be taken down by the

400
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:45,519
government

401
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:47,839
including that of caravan magazine

402
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,079
twitter restored that account after like

403
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,639
public outrage about it but this led to

404
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:55,199
a massive fallout between twitter and

405
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,920
the government what we need to be doing

406
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:58,720
at this moment

407
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,680
is to look at look more specifically at

408
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,000
the

409
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,399
information technology intermediary

410
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:05,199
guide

411
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:08,560
guidelines and digital media ethics code

412
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,079
rules it's quite a lot so let's just

413
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,600
call it intermediary rules for the

414
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,480
moment

415
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,560
um this has already been challenged by

416
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,959
many individuals collectives companies

417
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:17,199
and

418
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,800
artists in different jurisdictions

419
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:21,440
across the country uh this enactment uh

420
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,959
came about in february this

421
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,279
uh this uh this year but is really

422
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,320
coming into force

423
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,880
uh more recently um among many other

424
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,320
things there are three key

425
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,680
issues of our concerns with these rules

426
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,680
first it expands the meaning of

427
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,440
intermediaries to include

428
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,480
ott platforms like netflix or hot star

429
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,760
and also brings into the gambit um

430
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,760
digital media portals like caravan

431
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,199
magazine the news minute

432
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,760
now these were not really included in

433
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,839
the earlier version of the rules

434
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,880
um second it makes it possible to trace

435
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
the origin of a message

436
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,440
breaking encryption and third it

437
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,680
mandates takedown of content failing

438
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:03,440
which unilateral blocking is made

439
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,399
possible

440
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:07,040
now compliance is mandatory uh failing

441
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,440
which

442
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,360
individuals or authorities of these

443
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,600
different bodies platforms

444
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,160
could fail face jail time uh accompanied

445
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,519
by huge fines

446
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:18,160
a significant worry with with this

447
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
edition of the rules is also the lack of

448
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,519
effective remedy or oversight to in in

449
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
any way challenge these orders given the

450
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,480
really short time frame available for

451
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,839
compliance

452
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,000
i mean the context i described earlier

453
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,399
leaves us in a situation of severe

454
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,320
anxiety about how these rules are going

455
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,199
to be used

456
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:39,519
and more importantly how it is going to

457
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,720
be used to

458
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,959
legalize illegitimate clamp down on

459
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:44,240
freedoms

460
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,160
which only is going to result in further

461
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,000
shrinking of civic space

462
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,600
now the problem with these rules is

463
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,519
argued by many is not only that it

464
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,440
violates constitutional internationally

465
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,079
guaranteed

466
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,800
rights but it also violates the very act

467
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,720
under which it was created

468
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,279
these rules pose a long-term problem to

469
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,160
indians it's not

470
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
only an immediate problem because it is

471
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,600
unclear as to

472
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,360
how different governments not only the

473
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,720
union government how

474
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,320
different state governments are going to

475
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,560
end up using it across the country

476
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,720
i mean in my assessment it may well come

477
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,199
back to harm or bite the very makers of

478
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,320
these rules

479
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,759
in different forms since as david noted

480
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,920
this problem has been enabled by

481
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,519
successive governments

482
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,639
dating you know beyond behind before

483
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,639
2014 even uh besides this the rules for

484
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,199
reasons i mentioned about also defies

485
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:37,759
the logic letter and legacy of precious

486
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:38,880
jurisprudence

487
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,880
relating to rule of law fundamental

488
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,120
freedoms that our judiciary has

489
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
evolved over decades it really does

490
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,639
break down a lot of those guarantees

491
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,079
that we have had

492
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:53,120
i mean another sort of external worry i

493
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,199
have is also that

494
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,240
these rules may end up or rather

495
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,160
there's some this fear of exporting of

496
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,279
such a model

497
00:17:01,279 --> 00:17:03,759
uh to other jurisdictions now especially

498
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:04,480
since

499
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,480
uh we live in a neighborhood that often

500
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,880
draws inspiration from each other

501
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,199
given our so common social political

502
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,559
legal histories

503
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,880
but i mean just to wrap up while all

504
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
this on is on one side

505
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,199
another worrying reality persist which

506
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,079
is that

507
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,400
while legitimate yet inconvenient speech

508
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
is being actioned

509
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,400
hate speech is allowed to progress in

510
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,439
its full form

511
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,080
these rules do little to mitigate that

512
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,679
and the recent washington

513
00:17:31,679 --> 00:17:34,880
post revelations show give us a window

514
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,880
into the operation of giants like

515
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
facebook who have not only failed to

516
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
address hate speech

517
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,000
it could be argued that they may well

518
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,600
have shielded hate speech

519
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,360
therefore the argument is not that the

520
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,760
private sector should not be regulated

521
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,640
but that this regulation should be um

522
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,440
discussed

523
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,600
uh in a way and developed in a way that

524
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,440
is in confirmation with our

525
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,559
jurisprudence

526
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:59,120
and doesn't do harm rather than remedy

527
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,080
the situation

528
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,160
i think ultimately the voices that are

529
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,360
affected by

530
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,760
the current regulatory framework are

531
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
religious and cast-based minorities

532
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,320
human rights defenders women and gender

533
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
diverse individuals

534
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,080
essentially all voices of descent will

535
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:16,480
suffer

536
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,320
thanks gaia i just want to pause at this

537
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:21,840
point and ask if anybody had any

538
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:25,039
questions for david

539
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,280
i i have one and i'll i'll start with

540
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,120
that um you know

541
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,120
david the indian government's justifying

542
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,400
the rules that issued you know saying

543
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,840
well other democracies have done the

544
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,480
same

545
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,919
i was just wondering what your thoughts

546
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,480
are on that

547
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:43,039
yeah i mean i think that's a good point

548
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:43,919
to raise and it

549
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,760
actually tracks with what gaia was just

550
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:47,440
saying in a way that

551
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,520
uh others in the region might look to

552
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,480
india

553
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,360
as a model as well i mean clearly

554
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,840
there's a lot of

555
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,000
um of problematic regulation

556
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,039
around the world there is there's a kind

557
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:01,280
of

558
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:05,200
rhetoric in democratic societies

559
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,760
right now and in democratic governments

560
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,440
that is

561
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:13,039
inconsistent with the idea of protecting

562
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:15,600
freedom of expression and other human

563
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,480
rights

564
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,280
online and the indian government has

565
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:19,760
been

566
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,080
benefiting from that global debate

567
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,160
there's no question about it um

568
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:27,200
but it but it's also deeply disingenuous

569
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,240
um you know most governments

570
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,480
you know particularly if we look to

571
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:33,679
europe right now

572
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,520
and the kind of debate that's taking

573
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,600
place in brussels

574
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,080
at the european commission around new

575
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,840
internet regulations

576
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,200
you know is is relatively

577
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
thoughtful even if we don't agree with

578
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,880
all the particulars

579
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,280
it is open to civil society

580
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,799
participation

581
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:57,600
it is um transparent to a large degree

582
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,160
and so even if the outcomes sometimes

583
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,760
aren't exactly what we think are

584
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,720
consistent

585
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,919
fully with human rights protections

586
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:07,120
they're proceeding in a rule of

587
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:09,120
law-oriented framework

588
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,159
and you know for for india to complain

589
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,280
or to explain its rules

590
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,360
as similar to what's already been

591
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,480
adopted

592
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,919
uh in um in other democratic countries

593
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:24,559
i think is really um well it's simply

594
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,760
not true

595
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,960
um and it's it's a reflection i think in

596
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,080
some ways

597
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360
of the reality that the government

598
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,320
actually understands that its decision

599
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,080
making here is out of step

600
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,799
with fundamental principles of human

601
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:41,520
rights

602
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:45,120
and rule of law if anything it's a

603
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
it's a self-indictment more than

604
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,840
anything else

605
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,280
yeah thank you for that um i see baby

606
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:55,760
has a

607
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,640
question uh davey would you like to ask

608
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,000
that

609
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
um yeah hello hi i just wanted to ask

610
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:03,120
because

611
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,120
both guy and david were speaking to um

612
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,799
tech companies and how they have

613
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,880
been operating in this situation and um

614
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,480
we've seen many times that they've said

615
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,320
you know it's glitches or their mistakes

616
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:13,760
their technical errors and to what

617
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,960
extent i'm thinking

618
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,799
should we be pushing on remedial actions

619
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,960
where these result in rights violations

620
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,720
so i i work on southeast asia and for

621
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,240
example in vietnam there was this

622
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
instance where they took down live

623
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,120
streaming as a

624
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,480
as the police were coming into the

625
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,159
village and attacking villages

626
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,159
and that was a direct influence on you

627
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,520
know what was happening in the village

628
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:31,919
and

629
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
um yeah i just wanted to post that

630
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:37,679
question as a thought question out there

631
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,000
well i mean i'll just say a word and

632
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,799
then unfortunately i have to leave

633
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,720
and i i'd be very interested to hear

634
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,320
what others think about this

635
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,480
question but david it's a it's a really

636
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,400
good question

637
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,039
in part because so much of our

638
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,320
discussion

639
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:59,520
around government pressure

640
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,039
and company compliance

641
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:06,799
with um with government demands

642
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:09,360
is at a level of just thinking about

643
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,400
sort of the demand

644
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:13,440
and the response and we don't

645
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
we don't have a very mature conversation

646
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,919
about the remedies that should be

647
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
available to individuals

648
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,679
in the situations where their content is

649
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:26,080
taken

650
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,559
down or where they're subject to attack

651
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:29,600
online

652
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,960
or other kinds of harms that that might

653
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,760
take place

654
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,720
online that are cognizable as a matter

655
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:37,840
of law

656
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,159
um i i think you're you're really just

657
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,360
highlighting

658
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:45,520
uh a deficiency in the framework

659
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,400
around dealing with these issues because

660
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,280
we just so

661
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:52,880
so rarely talk about about remedy so i'm

662
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,720
just glad you raised the question i

663
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,520
defer to others as to how they think

664
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,440
both the platforms

665
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:00,640
and governments and also the

666
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,640
international community should be

667
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:08,000
responding in a remedial sense

668
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,520
thank you david um i'm going to

669
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,720
um yeah i'm just going to go

670
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,640
to siddharth now if there aren't any

671
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,320
more questions for david

672
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:21,440
um you know maybe you could you could

673
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,240
build on

674
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,320
one what david pointed out about you

675
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,880
know um

676
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,360
yeah sorry uh yeah a little bit of your

677
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,880
experience of how

678
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,320
what these takedown orders have been

679
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,559
like and how you expect digital news to

680
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,159
be affected by these new rules

681
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:39,200
thanks okay so so we have uh

682
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,480
at the wire no no direct experience of

683
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
uh takedown orders ourselves um

684
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:49,120
either from any social media

685
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:51,450
company or or any other kind of

686
00:23:51,450 --> 00:23:53,520
[Music]

687
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,799
government directive we have had

688
00:23:56,799 --> 00:24:00,480
run-ins with a couple of companies

689
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,640
and politicians who filed defamation

690
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,799
cases so traditionally the

691
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,320
the major form of i mean just for uh

692
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,600
participants at right scott to

693
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,760
understand the

694
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,360
traditional form of harassment of

695
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,799
of journalism in india because we have

696
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:23,039
as people know uh six seven decades of

697
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:26,240
fairly robust jurisprudence defending

698
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,600
freedom of

699
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,960
uh the press but

700
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,520
the one loophole uh is defamation

701
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,240
and defamation is what was the preferred

702
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,279
route

703
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:42,640
for politicians for governments and for

704
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,240
the corporate sector uh to

705
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:50,640
harass and intimidate uh preempt

706
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,080
and punish media platforms for

707
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,200
publishing stories uh that

708
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,080
they didn't like so at the wire we've

709
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,200
had our fair share

710
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,400
of of defamation cases and uh

711
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
we have developed a mechanism to deal

712
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,880
with these um

713
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,840
all of these cases are frivolous and

714
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,640
time-consuming and wasteful on resources

715
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,760
money and and time but

716
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:21,279
um you know it's it's it's it's a it's a

717
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,960
known devil which one is able to deal

718
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:23,440
with

719
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,600
both uh civil defamation as well as the

720
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,880
more dangerous

721
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,960
uh criminal defamation but what's

722
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:30,720
happened over the last few years

723
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:36,559
is clearly the government looking for

724
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:40,400
methods of harassment and methods of

725
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,039
pressure

726
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:44,080
and intimidation that produce

727
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:47,120
a more direct uh and

728
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,600
you know unmediated effect so the

729
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,320
problem for

730
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
the problem with with the establishment

731
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
when it comes to defamation is that

732
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:57,039
the matter goes to the court and it's

733
00:25:57,039 --> 00:25:58,480
the court's call whether they grant an

734
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,919
injunction or they don't

735
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:01,279
whether they find you guilty or they

736
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,559
don't whether they find you or they

737
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,679
don't

738
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,039
and uh because the indian judiciary

739
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:11,279
uh prides on its independence so this is

740
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:12,720
not something the executive can take for

741
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,919
granted

742
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:17,120
so they have moved now citing

743
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,480
the allegedly unregulated nature of

744
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,000
digital media

745
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,320
into a scenario where they say we need

746
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,360
to have new rules

747
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,880
and regulations to uh protect

748
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,880
readers protect the public at large and

749
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,720
to protect the country

750
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:35,600
from the excesses of this unregulated

751
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,880
wild west

752
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,559
that is uh digital news and

753
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,440
i said this is a myth because the fact

754
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,840
that

755
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,640
the wire has been dragged to port the

756
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,799
fact that other digital platforms have

757
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:52,000
have been taken to court incidentally

758
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,559
not just for defamation uh because we've

759
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,440
seen since the onset of the pandemic

760
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,200
um the state uh

761
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,960
getting the police to file direct

762
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,640
criminal charges

763
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,640
in relation to tweets in relation to

764
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,840
stories

765
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:11,039
that they find uh unpalatable

766
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,720
uh and the fact that we are digital

767
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,760
uh provides us no protection we are as

768
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:21,840
exposed and vulnerable to

769
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,360
cases of this kind which are

770
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,600
full-fledged criminal cases

771
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,679
as any other kind of media platform so

772
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,200
the fact is that

773
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,799
the experience of the last two or three

774
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,720
years itself makes it very clear that

775
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,000
digital media is not

776
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,679
unregulated it is not as if

777
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,399
somebody who is aggrieved by content

778
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,679
on a digital news platform does not know

779
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,559
where to turn

780
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,960
does not know which door to knock on

781
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,720
because there are many examples of

782
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:52,640
platforms like mine

783
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,600
uh which have been subjected to pressure

784
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,200
of one kind or the other

785
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,559
uh initiated on the basis of uh

786
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,919
of complaints and so this idea that

787
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,720
uh digital media needs to be regulated

788
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,480
in some way because otherwise

789
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:10,720
uh there's not a level playing field is

790
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:11,600
utter rubbish

791
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,120
but this is the logic on risk on which

792
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,360
the government has has proceeded

793
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,640
in order to frame these i.t rules which

794
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,159
are to my mind

795
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,760
uh not just offensive and um

796
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,279
you know they're offensive to the eye to

797
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,039
the concept of press freedom but they

798
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:27,520
would

799
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,120
they would if they are allowed to stand

800
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,720
um very shortly astound the death knell

801
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,399
for for media freedom in this country

802
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:37,840
because the idea

803
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,279
is to weaponize uh

804
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,320
a system of complaints from so-called

805
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:45,520
readers

806
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,840
and we know how politically motivated

807
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:52,960
groups of individuals often hand in

808
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,440
glove

809
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,320
or set in motion by the establishment or

810
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,720
by the ruling

811
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
know how to play this game very well

812
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,760
they know how to wield this weapon very

813
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,799
well

814
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,840
so you create a situation where digital

815
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,000
platforms have to comply

816
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,399
with a with an illegal in my mind an

817
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,600
unconstitutional

818
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,880
but ridiculously cumbersome grievance

819
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,159
addressable mechanism and then

820
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:20,480
essentially hold us hold a gun to our

821
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:21,760
head

822
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,200
for falling out of that mechanism

823
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,760
if at the end of the day a government

824
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:29,840
committee decides

825
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:32,320
that steps we have taken to address

826
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,600
media complaints

827
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,039
are not adequate so this represents a

828
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:37,919
qualitatively

829
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,760
new attack on digital media it of course

830
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,600
builds on a decade-long

831
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,640
uh establishment practice you know with

832
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,279
the i.t

833
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,679
act and the i.t act itself has lots of

834
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:53,760
provisions which are misused

835
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,399
section 66 may have been read down but

836
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,880
section 67 which prohibits

837
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,760
the electronic transmission of obscene

838
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,919
or lascivious material

839
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:07,679
uh has been used against all kinds of

840
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,559
legitimate uh media expression against

841
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,080
people on social media so you

842
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,159
you can draw a cartoon that uh

843
00:30:16,159 --> 00:30:18,159
severely lampoons a chief minister or

844
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:19,760
the prime minister

845
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,080
but would not be considered obscene if

846
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,919
it were printed in a book

847
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:26,799
or in a newspaper because you have seven

848
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
decades of jurisprudence on what

849
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:32,320
constitutes obscenity uh yet

850
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,240
the police will say because this cartoon

851
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,360
has been disseminated electronically

852
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,600
it falls foul of the crime of the

853
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,200
electronic dissemination of the

854
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,200
same material and you get embroiled in

855
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,120
the case so so there are lots of

856
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:46,960
there were lots of land mines in the i.t

857
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:49,600
act and other laws that

858
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,919
could have been invoked and were invoked

859
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,679
but what we are seeing with the new it

860
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:55,600
rules is a qualitative escalation of

861
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,960
this offensive

862
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:58,960
we have gone to court other uh digital

863
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,000
media platforms have gone

864
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,000
caught and we are confident that when we

865
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,200
have our day uh

866
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,880
and we are able to put our arguments

867
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:06,320
before the judge

868
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,919
uh the the judiciary in india will see

869
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:12,960
that this uh these rules represent

870
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,799
an illegal and unconstitutional attempt

871
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,200
to to stifle freedom of press

872
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,279
and that's what we are where we are at

873
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,679
right now

874
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,840
yeah thank you for that um i just wanted

875
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,519
to take a brief pause and see if there

876
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:29,120
are any questions aditi

877
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,159
i saw that you had a question um

878
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:35,360
maybe you want to ask that yes

879
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,600
uh thank you thank you access now for

880
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,760
organizing this final discussion

881
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,159
uh so this is following up on what devi

882
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,200
had asked

883
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,279
is it possible to quantify the harms of

884
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:46,480
clamping down

885
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:49,039
on freedom of expression online as it is

886
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,640
done with right to privacy

887
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,519
for instance if there's a data breach uh

888
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:54,480
there is still

889
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,039
a fine imposed on the company is a

890
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,200
similar thing possible here

891
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,039
is there any kind of quantification

892
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:03,279
possible and the second question is to

893
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,720
mr vajraji

894
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,000
about is if the effect is only on solely

895
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,799
digital media like the wire the scroll

896
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,360
the news minute etc or does it also take

897
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,480
into account

898
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,720
things like the uh website of the indian

899
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:18,320
express or the hindu

900
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,799
because the latest letter that uh was

901
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:23,519
sent by the mib on 26th may

902
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:26,320
also has an appendix for legacy

903
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,960
publishers to furnish their details

904
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,960
so if you can throw them right on that

905
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,240
thank you service who would like to

906
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,200
speak to the first

907
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:39,039
question gaia would you like do you have

908
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,000
any thoughts

909
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,240
look i mean in most litigation it's

910
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:45,600
usually costs that's

911
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:49,440
um that's that's sort of um

912
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,279
calculated on on different fronts now

913
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,039
unless it's done quite differently it's

914
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:53,840
almost like

915
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:56,960
how defamation is dealt with no

916
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,440
um so it's not really possible to give

917
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,440
one sort of yardstick or meter because

918
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,640
it also

919
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,279
then depends on a particular

920
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,200
individual's reach and how much that

921
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,919
content

922
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,840
may or may not have reached but i think

923
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,679
rahman might probably be in a better

924
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:12,399
position

925
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,559
to to to to reflect on that particular

926
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
question

927
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:19,039
yes i'm going to try and answer it and

928
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,960
in fact i think it might relate to this

929
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,640
experience as well so it will be a good

930
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,559
setup for and maybe

931
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,320
respond a bit to that and also that the

932
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,919
question goes specifically to him

933
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:29,360
but for example like i think we need to

934
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,880
remember that there are wide types of

935
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,720
intermediaries so the best example is

936
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,159
those reporters authors

937
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:35,600
who say regularly use commercial

938
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:37,279
blogging platforms or

939
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:39,919
providers to post their in work can

940
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:40,399
literally

941
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:41,679
be able to compute the harm that's

942
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:43,679
caused to them by not regularly

943
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:44,399
reporting

944
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:45,600
of course any good journalists would say

945
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:46,880
there's very little money in reporting

946
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,240
but there are ways you can compute and

947
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:48,799
assess

948
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,159
the impact it has on somebody's

949
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,080
professional career for those

950
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,080
who are larger services and i know for

951
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:56,000
example that's not happen very regularly

952
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,559
in india

953
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:59,200
but say imagine you know say the wire or

954
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,840
other new services who exist who may use

955
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,919
party providers to serve it to serve

956
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,360
their data that means you know

957
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:07,519
to either say host it or do you run a

958
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:09,040
content distribution network

959
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,560
it is an interruption that they can talk

960
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,399
about it the number of viewers who can't

961
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:13,599
regularly access it

962
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
and do a sense of computation about this

963
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,639
sort of damage that is caused there of

964
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:18,159
course the ultimate reality is at least

965
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:18,879
an indian

966
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:20,879
indian context and so that emphasizes

967
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:22,480
look at past jurisdictions india doesn't

968
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,839
really avoid damages at all

969
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:25,440
it's the unfortunate reality of how our

970
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,199
civil courts work but you can get a

971
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,079
sense of that

972
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:29,679
and of course in public law that is

973
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,760
constitutional impact judges take note

974
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,280
of that seriously but that's an initial

975
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,000
sense of it

976
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,199
but it's very important for us to

977
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,560
remember as i keep saying the number of

978
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:37,520
people who come to me

979
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,040
with questions about the idea tools over

980
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,800
the last three to four weeks it's not

981
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,159
just even the news platforms and not

982
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,079
even the big social media intermediaries

983
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:46,719
every intermediary every pipe in between

984
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,079
from telecom companies

985
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:49,359
to content distribution network

986
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,280
companies to cyber security companies

987
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,839
to companies who service ads through ad

988
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:55,760
networks they're all impacted by it they

989
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,119
all don't know how it will be affecting

990
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:57,520
them

991
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,359
and that entire internet economy is

992
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,119
impacted by of course my larger concern

993
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:02,640
is the human rights impact of that which

994
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,119
again

995
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:05,200
we can document and do and perhaps india

996
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,640
is interesting that way because there is

997
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,680
some initial

998
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
work or the social and economic cost of

999
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:10,720
internet shutdowns

1000
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,079
but again i know that might be able to

1001
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,599
talk about this a bit more along with

1002
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:13,920
the

1003
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
other specific question pointed to him

1004
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,280
yeah so um

1005
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,760
uh you know the question on on

1006
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
quantifying damages and harms

1007
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:25,280
uh in 2015

1008
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,280
uh the bombay high court in a case

1009
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,680
uh the case is called nsc versus money

1010
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,119
life

1011
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,240
awarded 50 lakhs uh 50 lakh rupees worth

1012
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,680
of damages to money life

1013
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,160
for what was essentially a bogus

1014
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,760
defamation suit that they had brought

1015
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,520
against the publication

1016
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,880
uh so there is a you know a precedent

1017
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,320
uh of uh the courts awarding damages

1018
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,160
for um shall we say

1019
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:58,400
um you know frivolous or uh

1020
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,200
punitive uh you know suits malified

1021
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,200
prosecutions of one kind of the other

1022
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,800
civil suits and the uh indian criminal

1023
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:09,119
core i mean the ipc of course

1024
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,400
also has provision for

1025
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,160
going after public servants who engage

1026
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,720
in malicious prosecutions and so on but

1027
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,320
those are very very rarely invoked and

1028
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:23,119
i don't think even though many of the

1029
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:25,760
cases against us or the cases against

1030
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:27,119
you for example the sedition case

1031
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,079
against rajdeep saddasai and

1032
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,800
manal pandey and others or the case

1033
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,240
against dua which the supreme court

1034
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,400
recently dismissed

1035
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,240
to my mind in any democracy with the

1036
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,160
rule in law with rule of law would be

1037
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,280
considered

1038
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,000
textbook cases of malicious prosecution

1039
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:44,480
where

1040
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,000
uh steep fines and even more punitive

1041
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,680
measures against the erring police

1042
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,800
officials

1043
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,599
ought to have been imposed but we're

1044
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,119
pretty far from there right now i mean i

1045
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,960
would be happy at this stage

1046
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,119
if we are able to fight off some of the

1047
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:00,000
pressure

1048
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,920
uh and some of the some of the damage

1049
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,359
that is done to us

1050
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:06,480
uh uh later on i think we can look to

1051
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:08,480
try to quantify and make a demand for

1052
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,920
punitive damages

1053
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:13,680
uh on the second question um

1054
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,040
you're right i mean the itu rules apply

1055
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:17,280
to everybody they apply to

1056
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:20,960
all digital media publishing

1057
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,040
so that includes standalone digital

1058
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,880
publications like the wire or

1059
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:28,240
uh newsbinet or quint scroll etc it also

1060
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,119
applies to

1061
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:32,880
the websites of so-called legacy media

1062
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,200
all tv stations for example and in fact

1063
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,200
the biggest websites the biggest digital

1064
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,280
news websites in terms of traffic

1065
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,320
in india are run by you know ndtv

1066
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,880
times of india indian express and they

1067
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,440
all

1068
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:48,560
are required to comply with this

1069
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:52,400
uh with the i.t rules also included i

1070
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,440
should add

1071
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:57,040
are any website because the rules are

1072
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,240
drafted

1073
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,079
in with such vague language that it

1074
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:03,599
would apply to i would say

1075
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:06,720
if you write a blog

1076
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:09,119
uh a regular blog on where you comment

1077
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:11,440
and analyze on current affairs

1078
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:15,520
uh the it the inb ministry could say

1079
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:16,960
well why aren't you registered with us

1080
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,720
where is your grievance officer

1081
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:21,119
because there is no mention of there's

1082
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:23,200
no limitation of scale

1083
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,480
in other words there is no uh floor

1084
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,480
for the minimum number of readers that

1085
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:30,079
you have to have in order to comply with

1086
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:31,520
these rules

1087
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,560
and essentially they seem to be framed

1088
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,079
in such a way that the government can

1089
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:37,520
cherry pick

1090
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:40,800
so if you if you run a blog that has

1091
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,800
a huge amount of traffic and influence

1092
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
but is pro-government

1093
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,079
then chances are that your

1094
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,640
non-compliance with the iit rules will

1095
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,359
will go well below the radar but if you

1096
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:52,160
if you are

1097
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
uh somebody who writes a blog that is

1098
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,000
critical of the establishment

1099
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,160
uh no matter how small you are you could

1100
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,400
very well run the risk of

1101
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,400
uh punitive action by the government for

1102
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,119
this and i should also say that

1103
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:08,160
foreign newspapers and websites uh are

1104
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,599
not excluded

1105
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,480
so the rule says that if you are a

1106
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,880
foreign publication

1107
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,280
that is in the business of

1108
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
systematically providing your content

1109
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,960
uh to people in india then you have to

1110
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:24,880
comply so the new york times website is

1111
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:25,920
available

1112
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,599
they uh the guardian at one time they

1113
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:32,160
used to have standalone india portals

1114
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,839
like india inc and so on but they don't

1115
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:35,280
do that now but it doesn't matter

1116
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,119
the fact is that they are very keen to

1117
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,640
expand their leadership in india

1118
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,320
they cover india extensively they have

1119
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,320
offices and bureaus

1120
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,400
bureaus over here and if there is a

1121
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,839
question mark as to whether they need to

1122
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:47,200
comply to

1123
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,400
and uh so so this is uh really uh

1124
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:53,680
a very very sweeping rule that can bring

1125
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,760
literally tens of thousands of

1126
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,599
publishers under its ambit maybe even

1127
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,480
more

1128
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,520
why for example should your uncle's

1129
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,400
facebook page where he regularly posts

1130
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,839
comments

1131
00:40:05,839 --> 00:40:08,640
and analysis about elections and

1132
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,359
corruption

1133
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,200
and uh what's going on in the country uh

1134
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,880
surely that is also news and current

1135
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,800
affairs publication

1136
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,119
uh so why should why would he be

1137
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,160
excluded

1138
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:23,440
from the need to have a uh a grievance

1139
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,240
officer

1140
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,240
for example right so these are all

1141
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,839
ambiguities in the law

1142
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:31,119
which uh you know uh i think have been

1143
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:33,040
left in there deliberately so that the

1144
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:34,560
government is armed within

1145
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:36,720
with the ability to go after anybody

1146
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:38,160
that it wants

1147
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,200
uh i should also add if i if i may um

1148
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,800
that the publishers of

1149
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,480
uh in other words newspapers and tv

1150
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,640
channels are you know they met the

1151
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,920
minister and said look these rules

1152
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:51,599
shouldn't apply to us

1153
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,839
because we uh already come under the

1154
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:55,680
ambit of the press council of india or

1155
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:56,480
the

1156
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,960
uh broadcasting uh the broadcasting you

1157
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:00,560
know broadcast act

1158
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:03,280
and um you know so there is some attempt

1159
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:04,720
by them to wriggle out is possible the

1160
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:05,760
government may

1161
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,400
may let them go i don't know but our

1162
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,400
response to that would be to say well if

1163
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:10,880
if

1164
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:13,280
press council of india is a regulatory

1165
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,480
body then make it applicable to

1166
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,160
everybody

1167
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:18,160
let them let their ambit cover

1168
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,560
newspapers as well as digital publishers

1169
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,160
and make it the media council in india

1170
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,760
there is such a proposal floating around

1171
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,880
why do you need

1172
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,319
these i.t rules uh in order to uh

1173
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,040
you know uh so-called erect the

1174
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:33,200
scaffolding of a regulatory system

1175
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,119
so so there's a there's plenty to argue

1176
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:36,240
about and

1177
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,680
you know we hope to have all these

1178
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,319
issues get uh you know clarified

1179
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:42,000
in the course of our uh of our

1180
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,160
litigation and struck down as ultravirus

1181
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,960
thank you for that and just to talk

1182
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:52,319
about the really wide net that these

1183
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:53,680
rules are casting and i think it's a

1184
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:54,160
good

1185
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:56,960
point to bring sushant in um maybe you

1186
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:58,000
could talk a little bit

1187
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,359
uh about indian carnaun and the kinds of

1188
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:03,760
the kinds of order take down orders that

1189
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,040
you've seen

1190
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,319
um yeah

1191
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,800
hello hello and hello everyone else

1192
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:16,160
uh thanks for having me here so i

1193
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,480
started indian khan around 13 14 years

1194
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,839
back

1195
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:23,680
and my goal was just to make

1196
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:25,280
the search over indian law and court

1197
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,599
judgement easier so i just

1198
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:29,520
crawled also crawled the supreme court

1199
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,800
website got the

1200
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,160
laws and put them together uh at that

1201
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,760
time i did not know about all the

1202
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:36,400
problems

1203
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,240
that can come with it so i thought it

1204
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,440
was just to make law

1205
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:41,920
finding easier i was just doing phd at

1206
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,040
that time

1207
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,119
and did not thought think about much of

1208
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:47,440
the ramifications

1209
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,079
later i mean even though the court cases

1210
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:51,520
are public documents lot of

1211
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,560
court cases came up regarding removal

1212
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:58,079
but most of those court cases were these

1213
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:00,960
removals were actually went to court and

1214
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:01,680
initially

1215
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,440
i did not have any representation in

1216
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,599
many of these cases

1217
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,520
but only later on i realized that things

1218
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,880
can go wrong

1219
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:12,560
and i started having uh

1220
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:14,160
a point i started having lawyers for

1221
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,240
those cases

1222
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,640
but i think those are still the crux of

1223
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,480
that is the privacy versus people right

1224
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,440
to know

1225
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,040
and that is something that is not the

1226
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:26,400
direct harassment

1227
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,640
though people have visited my house for

1228
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,839
case removal

1229
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,000
and i mean i have been summoned in

1230
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,960
kerala high court

1231
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:35,760
for a contempt case uh for not following

1232
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:36,880
the order and

1233
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,599
people have beaten me there also so that

1234
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,319
can also happen when court cases come up

1235
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,800
uh but apart from that i think there is

1236
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,319
couple more interesting things that

1237
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,119
happen

1238
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:50,400
uh when i run the website is i mean

1239
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:53,680
jio has gos and isp has blocked indian

1240
00:43:53,680 --> 00:43:54,640
carnoun

1241
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,680
for around two three days somewhere

1242
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:01,280
i think two three years back and

1243
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,880
i mean most of the people asked why that

1244
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,880
was blocked they put up a notice saying

1245
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,200
as per the instructions of mighty and

1246
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,480
since these rules are actually

1247
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:13,520
not supposed to are supposed to be

1248
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,800
hidden or so called the blocking as per

1249
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,560
the blocking rules they are not supposed

1250
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:19,760
to be given out

1251
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,200
no one knows why their website was

1252
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,839
blocked and later i think around to

1253
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:25,359
around after three days

1254
00:44:25,359 --> 00:44:29,920
jio has uh lifted the ban on its own

1255
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,960
uh i filed an rti request mighty did not

1256
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,720
give me anything saying okay why was the

1257
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,599
website

1258
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,240
blog so i mean one of the big problems

1259
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:38,800
of

1260
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:42,079
the the confidential nature of these

1261
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,040
blocking

1262
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,640
is that no one knows the reason no one

1263
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,400
has anything to challenge

1264
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,160
i mean you since you don't have an order

1265
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:51,520
in front you cannot go to the court to

1266
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,119
say this order is illegal

1267
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,400
i mean what are you going to challenge

1268
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,040
in the book i mean i think this is

1269
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,760
similar problems people find in the uapa

1270
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:02,160
laws and similar security regulations

1271
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,280
where many of the

1272
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:05,839
things are in sealed envelopes and there

1273
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:07,119
is nothing to challenge

1274
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:09,200
and the judge has to you cannot really

1275
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,280
question can't see the evidence that has

1276
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,400
been

1277
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,040
presented against you so that is one big

1278
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:15,760
problem

1279
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,359
and i think other than that even the

1280
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:19,040
cyber crime police keep sending me

1281
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:20,640
messages for takedown

1282
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,079
of court orders and i now

1283
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:25,839
i have got enough thick skin to just

1284
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:27,440
tell them no these are court orders and

1285
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,280
you need actually a quote order to

1286
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:33,280
remove them the intermediary liability

1287
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:33,920
rules

1288
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,319
were not really weaponized now as

1289
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:42,160
that said the um i mean i have claimed

1290
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,440
in all my previous cases

1291
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,880
to be an intermediary because i'm just

1292
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:46,480
an intermediary of court

1293
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,920
publishing their laws so

1294
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,000
in that respect if i qualify as an

1295
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,920
intermediary but now the rules are such

1296
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:54,400
that

1297
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,800
the takedown notices by government are

1298
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,079
really weaponized

1299
00:45:58,079 --> 00:45:59,440
that you need to have a grievance

1300
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,520
redressal uh mechanism

1301
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,000
and um the definition is also so broad

1302
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,240
uh of what qualifies as a news media or

1303
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,200
not that even

1304
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,280
some may say that indian quantum also

1305
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,960
qualifies because it uploads daily code

1306
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,319
judgments

1307
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:17,680
so that is what i

1308
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:20,880
feel are the problems with uh this

1309
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,119
and uh i mean i being a single person

1310
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:24,640
running the website was also

1311
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:27,520
a lot of ramifications because people

1312
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,839
coming down to the home is also not

1313
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:33,280
i mean it hasn't had any inadvertent

1314
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,319
experience yet

1315
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:36,000
but it may have and that is why i will

1316
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:38,800
always get my address secret till now

1317
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:43,839
for that reason okay

1318
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:45,839
yeah thanks thanks for that sushantha

1319
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:47,680
that you know against that context it's

1320
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,400
also

1321
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,720
uh important to note uh that live lord

1322
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:51,599
challenged uh

1323
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,920
has filed a challenge and has got a

1324
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:56,000
temporary injunction against the rules

1325
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,520
being forced against them so

1326
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,200
that's a really important point i mean

1327
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:00,400
there's a there's a question that i

1328
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,760
wanted to pose actually building on

1329
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,440
something that you said you know is that

1330
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,280
a lot of the coverage is framing this as

1331
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,960
a battle between you know big tech and

1332
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,920
the government and i think the

1333
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,520
government is also keen to kind of frame

1334
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,319
it as that

1335
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:13,200
um you know who else is kind of uh

1336
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:14,640
caught up in this battle you know and

1337
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,240
what are the kind of consequences of

1338
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,479
that

1339
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:25,839
who is this question too um who'd like

1340
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:26,559
to take it

1341
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:31,760
uh gaia would you like to take it

1342
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,200
yeah yeah so um so for in

1343
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,559
actually it's a really good question

1344
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,040
about this this particular

1345
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,240
set of rules has as i said broadened

1346
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:45,280
the uh like ambit of who is intermediary

1347
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:45,839
right

1348
00:47:45,839 --> 00:47:49,200
now ott's uh digital media

1349
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,200
portals have all come into this now

1350
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:52,240
actually the bigger

1351
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:55,440
question now becomes this big

1352
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,720
facebook twitter size um platforms

1353
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,440
versus

1354
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:01,680
emerging alternatives right already

1355
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,839
we've recognized that and this goes back

1356
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,520
to the question that davey had actually

1357
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,000
initially

1358
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,559
asked about remedial measures and i i

1359
00:48:08,559 --> 00:48:10,000
had messaged her saying that

1360
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:12,240
remedial measures has little to do with

1361
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:13,040
the law

1362
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:15,440
and more to do with how these companies

1363
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:16,640
operate

1364
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:18,640
and the monopoly that they enjoy no i

1365
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:20,079
mean there is no alternative

1366
00:48:20,079 --> 00:48:22,000
uh effective alternative at the moment

1367
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,280
for some of them

1368
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,520
so for alternatives to emerge small and

1369
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,680
medium sort of enterprises need to be

1370
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,960
able to survive

1371
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:31,520
now what these rules effectively do is

1372
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:32,720
that they make it

1373
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:34,960
near impossible like foreign

1374
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:37,200
organization like india cannon which

1375
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,680
is very well reputed as you heard from

1376
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,400
soshan

1377
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,400
it's already sort of daunting not to

1378
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,839
deal with all of these

1379
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:47,119
imagine a startup trying to engage

1380
00:48:47,119 --> 00:48:50,319
in um in in this content

1381
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:52,319
space the kind of burden that's going to

1382
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:54,480
fall on them the amount of compliance

1383
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,160
that they would have to go for

1384
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:57,280
they are not going to ruffle the

1385
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,200
feathers of the government no they what

1386
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,119
they would actually end up doing

1387
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:03,760
is over compliance and what what would

1388
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,640
happen is they will preempt a situation

1389
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,920
where they might have to face the

1390
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:10,160
government so they'll proactively start

1391
00:49:10,160 --> 00:49:12,319
taking down content that is even

1392
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:14,800
mildly problematic so that is actually

1393
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,000
what will happen and that

1394
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,480
is the that is the environment that

1395
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,319
these this current rules is going to

1396
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:21,920
foster

1397
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,599
ramen is there anything to add on that

1398
00:49:25,599 --> 00:49:29,440
android is curious for software on this

1399
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,119
seeing the directly and directly also

1400
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:33,040
often you know his contents in

1401
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,480
its by other big tech players so he sees

1402
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:35,680
the sort of tension they face so i

1403
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:37,119
actually don't ask

1404
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,000
what you thought about this

1405
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,440
framing the debate as big tech versus

1406
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,200
government is not the right debate right

1407
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:47,920
i mean

1408
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:49,359
you are including everyone in the

1409
00:49:49,359 --> 00:49:51,599
intermediary section this is just

1410
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,280
doesn't mean of course in the new

1411
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,400
section you expand that ambit even more

1412
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,400
and you go to the ott you expand that

1413
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,000
even more and

1414
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:03,200
i mean the the rules if even in the

1415
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,480
other segment

1416
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:07,359
um that applies to all the intermediary

1417
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:09,040
are not lightweight rules

1418
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,640
the the grivaan's redressals has to be

1419
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,079
immediate almost

1420
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,200
and uh within 24 hours i mean i usually

1421
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:18,400
take two three days to actually

1422
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,920
implement a court order because

1423
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:22,640
i have work lined up and other things to

1424
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:23,839
deal with

1425
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:25,599
so even court order for me takes two

1426
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:27,040
three days at least to

1427
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:30,079
get done um if they are going to ask 24

1428
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,520
hour removal and things like that then

1429
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:35,599
i i think it's a very difficult for

1430
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:41,839
anyone to operate in that way

1431
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:44,559
it's very important to note the

1432
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:46,240
requirements for significant social

1433
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,520
media intermediaries that can also

1434
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,119
include not-for-profit entities to do

1435
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:49,680
this

1436
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,119
including perhaps the communication

1437
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:53,119
channels on say wikimedia or other

1438
00:50:53,119 --> 00:50:54,000
platforms

1439
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
uh there's a data retention requirement

1440
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,359
for over half a year

1441
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,520
so in fact there are a imagine the cost

1442
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:00,480
but also imagine

1443
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,000
platforms who say yeah we don't want to

1444
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:03,680
enable that because that is

1445
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:05,920
an incredible harm on privacy on many

1446
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:07,119
other measures or for example like

1447
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:07,839
imagine

1448
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:09,359
people focus on supporting journalists

1449
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:11,280
or others who never keep data for that

1450
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:11,680
long

1451
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,680
except related to a particular story and

1452
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,119
also in a secure manner

1453
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:17,119
it's directly in fact meant to

1454
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,559
facilitate surveillance but also

1455
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:19,680
incredibly

1456
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,599
uh intrusive and damaging on the right

1457
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:23,119
to privacy not to mention digital

1458
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:23,920
security

1459
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,480
more generally

1460
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:33,200
yeah thanks for that i think we haven't

1461
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:34,960
talked about a lot of the privacy harms

1462
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,480
that these that these rules

1463
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:39,920
um can introduce um i see that i

1464
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,200
wanted to check if there's any more

1465
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,640
questions i see other thing has a

1466
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,040
question

1467
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,119
all right thank you so

1468
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:54,240
uh gaia the question is that rules and

1469
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:55,760
the code don't really expand the

1470
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,000
definition of intermediaries do they

1471
00:51:58,000 --> 00:51:59,680
instead they rather create a new

1472
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:02,079
category of publishers of online curated

1473
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:02,720
content

1474
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:04,240
or publishers of news and current

1475
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,920
affairs content and

1476
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,760
while they may overlap in terms of

1477
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:09,200
function for instance

1478
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:12,079
uh if the wire has a comment section for

1479
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,440
the comment section it becomes an

1480
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:14,400
intermediary

1481
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,400
and for the news article itself it's a

1482
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,480
publisher of news and current affairs

1483
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:19,119
content

1484
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,680
but there have been attempts to silently

1485
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,040
and therefore

1486
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,720
also silo the obligations there or did i

1487
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,800
misread something

1488
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,559
i just want to flag that i think we lost

1489
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:37,040
kai in between people

1490
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,640
but if she's rejoining because she want

1491
00:52:38,640 --> 00:52:40,079
me if there's anything that goes towards

1492
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,839
on legal stuff you i i would be her

1493
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:43,520
backup with their connection issues

1494
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:47,119
i can try and answer that would be okay

1495
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,319
but i can do my best uh and i think your

1496
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:53,680
point is absolutely valid the

1497
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:55,200
rules technically do something worse

1498
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:57,440
they categorize they

1499
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:59,119
that's not what parliament in parliament

1500
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:00,720
was very clear it said this is

1501
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,160
one definition of intermediary which is

1502
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,160
very broad and just by the

1503
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:05,599
brief history that's because everyone

1504
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:08,000
asked to be an intermediary back in 2005

1505
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,160
um when the rule the process to amend

1506
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,160
the act happened after the famous bazi

1507
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:12,720
case

1508
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,359
where arrested because people said the

1509
00:53:15,359 --> 00:53:16,640
purpose of this

1510
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,800
parent section section 79 is to give

1511
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,079
legal protection it's to give a

1512
00:53:20,079 --> 00:53:21,920
qualified legal immunity

1513
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,280
if you're an intermediary involved in

1514
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:25,200
handling other people's data

1515
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,559
communication messages and you don't

1516
00:53:26,559 --> 00:53:28,559
have full control uh and therefore

1517
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:29,040
because

1518
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:30,559
that was a protective section everyone

1519
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:31,680
rushed in to be included in that

1520
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:32,400
definition

1521
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:33,680
and ultimately that's what parliament

1522
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:35,599
signed off on nps in their wisdom in

1523
00:53:35,599 --> 00:53:37,040
those three minutes that were there to

1524
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,960
clear the id at amendments you know put

1525
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,240
that in now

1526
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:41,359
what they've done is a sub

1527
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:42,960
categorization so they basically the

1528
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,319
executive branch has gone ahead and

1529
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,240
basically perverted with parliamentary

1530
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,559
just create a broad definition sub right

1531
00:53:48,559 --> 00:53:50,319
categorize it and put so many burdens

1532
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:51,440
there which i think was what like so

1533
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,359
saying right you now hesitate to say

1534
00:53:53,359 --> 00:53:54,480
you're an intermediary

1535
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,480
because it actually makes your life much

1536
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,400
worse and people who a couple of years

1537
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,839
ago in the tech sector who would have

1538
00:53:59,839 --> 00:54:01,119
said yeah obviously we're intermediary

1539
00:54:01,119 --> 00:54:03,119
they're careful because for example

1540
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:04,400
our significant social media

1541
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:06,559
intermediaries telecom players as well

1542
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,000
who may have social media functions now

1543
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,119
embedded like every

1544
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:11,520
telco has a sort of social network uh

1545
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,960
sort of embedded in their payments

1546
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,040
platform or whatever right like abarth

1547
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,720
reminds me of my family who are there

1548
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,240
how to communicate

1549
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:20,079
are the full mandates on them as well

1550
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:21,520
and i think that's what's happened then

1551
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,079
this is absolutely right the the rules

1552
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:25,520
didn't expand the definition of

1553
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:26,240
intermediary

1554
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:28,480
but they perverted the purpose of it and

1555
00:54:28,480 --> 00:54:30,800
by sub classifying it they created it

1556
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,880
uh and expanded its scope in a massive

1557
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:34,400
way and one thing they did do

1558
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,640
is the rules try to cast within their

1559
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:37,520
ambit

1560
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:39,680
digital news publishers and others

1561
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,280
somehow within the

1562
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,400
definitely from the definition of

1563
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:43,680
intermediaries with the government's

1564
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,040
rule making powers for

1565
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:46,799
intermediaries which is completely

1566
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:48,400
improper just to like leave one last

1567
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,760
point i think it's a struggle with the

1568
00:54:49,760 --> 00:54:51,520
minister of electronics and iot

1569
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,359
uh during previous administrations but

1570
00:54:53,359 --> 00:54:54,160
it's gotten worse with this

1571
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,280
administration is that

1572
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:56,960
the id act is not their constituent

1573
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,480
assembly they can't do anything they

1574
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,319
want there it's a limited law passed by

1575
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:01,280
parliament that's about

1576
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:03,119
mention which already has problems in it

1577
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,880
but it's a law where you have limited

1578
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:06,559
rule making power for example

1579
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,559
under the i.t ad i can't say that or you

1580
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:10,400
know reacting sami cannot appear on the

1581
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,920
internet at all for any reason because

1582
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:12,559
her name

1583
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,400
is that you have to go with clear intent

1584
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,920
or limitation and that doesn't seem to

1585
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,480
be purpose

1586
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,400
the idea is let's put in as much as we

1587
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:19,920
can because otherwise we'll have to go

1588
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:20,640
to parliament

1589
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:22,240
and they probably will get that law

1590
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:24,160
anyway in parliament if they did do that

1591
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,520
but they're saying we don't need to go

1592
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,799
through the pretense of that process

1593
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:33,680
yeah thanks for that ramen we're almost

1594
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,119
at the mark um

1595
00:55:35,119 --> 00:55:37,280
we have a little bit of leeway to extend

1596
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,799
if there are any more questions

1597
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:42,480
so i just wanted to check bear cheese

1598
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,680
please you're a

1599
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,240
mutant sorry you're a mute yeah

1600
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:49,280
apologies

1601
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,200
my name is beatrice i work for the bbc

1602
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:52,480
in the united kingdom

1603
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:54,720
um it's perhaps a question for rahman

1604
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,040
we've talked a lot about the role of

1605
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:59,760
digital content platforms but taking a

1606
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,200
step further in terms of the role of

1607
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,400
isps and

1608
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,200
mobile phone companies what evidence is

1609
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:06,000
there today

1610
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,240
that they have pushed back on any

1611
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,400
unlawful requests or overly broad

1612
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,960
requests

1613
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,359
so i can share based on my experience

1614
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,359
talking to different isps and putting

1615
00:56:17,359 --> 00:56:17,599
them

1616
00:56:17,599 --> 00:56:19,359
in industry and currently is that they

1617
00:56:19,359 --> 00:56:21,040
do try and push back on requests some of

1618
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:22,640
them are publicly on record

1619
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,400
when the websites and ship orders were

1620
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,119
issued in india even during the

1621
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:27,760
2005-2009 period

1622
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,119
particularly even at one point of time

1623
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:31,280
block spot was blocked and that that is

1624
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:32,720
probably a defining moment where because

1625
00:56:32,720 --> 00:56:34,000
that is so public

1626
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,079
and the push back was so strong the

1627
00:56:36,079 --> 00:56:37,599
government felt stung by it and i think

1628
00:56:37,599 --> 00:56:39,280
that telecom industry told them that

1629
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,040
look don't do this again because this is

1630
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,799
what you're going to get

1631
00:56:42,799 --> 00:56:44,319
they i think i've tried to tell them

1632
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:45,440
that in the context of internet

1633
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:46,880
shutdowns as well but that's a separate

1634
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,599
topic

1635
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:48,880
but what i can share is for example

1636
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:50,480
conversations that people in telecom

1637
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:51,359
industry have said

1638
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:53,119
well actually you know we've prevented

1639
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:54,400
them from doing horrible things

1640
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,280
sometimes

1641
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,640
but they don't really review what they

1642
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:58,400
send us we have tens of thousands of

1643
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,680
website blogging

1644
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:01,200
of websites that we have blog over the

1645
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,280
years and we are not even uh directed to

1646
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:05,119
clean them up and it's a struggle and

1647
00:57:05,119 --> 00:57:06,160
for example one

1648
00:57:06,160 --> 00:57:07,920
uh protein guy named the company said

1649
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,280
that it actually impacts network

1650
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:10,079
performance

1651
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:11,839
it impacts our filters and what we

1652
00:57:11,839 --> 00:57:13,680
deploy there and our users suffer

1653
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,799
because we are still implementing

1654
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:16,480
blocked lists that are out of date

1655
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:18,720
um what i think you'll notice is that

1656
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:19,680
when it comes to

1657
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,319
elements about the blocking rules etc

1658
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:23,920
the sector overall has

1659
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,520
tried to put some pressure back on the

1660
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:26,960
government they said we prefer

1661
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:28,960
court orders coming to us but they have

1662
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:30,160
this general position

1663
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,680
which is that we are licensed by the

1664
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:33,599
government of india beyond our point we

1665
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:35,200
cannot push back on them tremendously

1666
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,680
because

1667
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:37,520
they can just say you're not following a

1668
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,760
lie an order sent by the government that

1669
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,440
itself is a violation of the license

1670
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:42,880
condition even if the order is not

1671
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:43,760
lawful

1672
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,760
and their risk appetite on that is low

1673
00:57:45,760 --> 00:57:47,520
and part of this i think also has been

1674
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,520
sometimes they put the issue on to

1675
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,200
online platforms and they say

1676
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,559
look don't send the blocking orders to

1677
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:54,160
us send it to them and get more

1678
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,200
regulatory power

1679
00:57:55,200 --> 00:57:56,960
ironically by passing this rule this

1680
00:57:56,960 --> 00:57:58,799
situation where everybody's gotten worse

1681
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,720
but these rules also apply to telcos

1682
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:03,359
isps edge providers content distribution

1683
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:04,319
networks

1684
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:05,599
you know all those sorts of actors as

1685
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:06,960
well and they're wondering oh how do we

1686
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:07,599
actually

1687
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:09,200
now implement this do we retain data for

1688
00:58:09,200 --> 00:58:10,720
up to six months if we have large

1689
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,160
amounts of data we keep

1690
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,000
do we do we have to appoint a compliance

1691
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,079
officer in india if we're a cdn or the

1692
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:17,280
things like that

1693
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,520
and i think that's quite striking thank

1694
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,680
you

1695
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,599
i i'll just like to add one thing here

1696
00:58:25,599 --> 00:58:29,119
so so in

1697
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:32,319
in some time back i think

1698
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,119
umitsu actually was contacted by some

1699
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,480
influential people

1700
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:40,240
to bring down indian kanun and then the

1701
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,880
mitsu actually called me that time to

1702
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:43,440
check

1703
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:46,319
what is happening and they actually

1704
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,160
cross verified with me that

1705
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,359
nothing is illegal here uh and

1706
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,119
i mean the way the other side has

1707
00:58:53,119 --> 00:58:54,720
presented was that as if

1708
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:56,000
indian cannon was doing something

1709
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:58,319
illegal and the domain registrar needs

1710
00:58:58,319 --> 00:59:00,799
to bring it down

1711
00:59:00,799 --> 00:59:05,839
so that happens again

1712
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,559
yeah thanks thanks for that i was just

1713
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,160
wondering if there's any more questions

1714
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,400
does anybody want to give any sort of

1715
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:20,160
final final

1716
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,960
words as we wrap up maybe i can go to

1717
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:24,799
siddharth first

1718
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,400
yeah well i think it's great that

1719
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:29,119
rightscon has flagged this

1720
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:31,599
because i think worldwide there needs to

1721
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,599
be greater awareness and discussion

1722
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:36,880
of the very precarious position that

1723
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:37,680
media freedom

1724
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:41,119
in general and digital media uh freedoms

1725
00:59:41,119 --> 00:59:42,000
in particular

1726
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:46,160
are are in and if this is happening in a

1727
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:47,119
in a democracy

1728
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:50,160
with uh rule of law uh then

1729
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:52,240
clearly uh the writing on the wall for

1730
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,240
the rest of the world is not very good

1731
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,680
and uh you know we at the wire

1732
00:59:57,680 --> 01:00:00,720
like many other digital uh platforms and

1733
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,079
other journalists and editors and

1734
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,520
publishers who are committed to media

1735
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:05,599
freedom intend to fight this

1736
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,920
and we are very confident that uh that

1737
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:09,040
we will

1738
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,079
get our day in court and prevail because

1739
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,280
at the end of the day there is such an

1740
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,839
intimate link between media freedom and

1741
01:00:15,839 --> 01:00:16,480
digital

1742
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:19,119
freedoms on the one hand and democracy

1743
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:20,079
on the other

1744
01:00:20,079 --> 01:00:21,920
that the courts are going to recognize

1745
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:23,599
this and are going to say that

1746
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,839
in order to defend democracy in india

1747
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:27,760
it's essential that

1748
01:00:27,760 --> 01:00:29,680
there'll be no compromise with media

1749
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,000
freedom

1750
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:37,119
yeah thank you for that um gaia i think

1751
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,280
you're back

1752
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,079
but yeah i'm on my phone so i don't have

1753
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:43,200
my camera on

1754
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:46,240
um i would actually make two points is

1755
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:48,960
uh that i think there needs to be more

1756
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,079
engagement

1757
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,240
actually india is quite lucky because we

1758
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:53,599
have we have

1759
01:00:53,599 --> 01:00:57,200
like a lot of really advanced um

1760
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,119
digital rights groups um like sflc

1761
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:03,440
internet freedom foundation several like

1762
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:05,280
i can go naming no so we're actually

1763
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:05,920
lucky

1764
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:08,559
in comparison to other jurisdictions we

1765
01:01:08,559 --> 01:01:10,160
have quite a lot of experts

1766
01:01:10,160 --> 01:01:12,880
we also have digital rights uh experts

1767
01:01:12,880 --> 01:01:15,119
beyond organizations lawyers that

1768
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,119
that understand the digital realm but

1769
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,480
what is actually needed

1770
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:21,680
is a lot more engagement with the

1771
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,319
legal development in the regulatory

1772
01:01:24,319 --> 01:01:25,280
framework

1773
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:27,440
beyond from us beyond a legal

1774
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,480
perspective

1775
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,079
there needs to be a sociological

1776
01:01:30,079 --> 01:01:31,839
perspective and therefore i hope that

1777
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:32,960
the media

1778
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:36,480
that civil society engages more with

1779
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,559
digital uh regulatory developments

1780
01:01:38,559 --> 01:01:40,079
that's on the one hand

1781
01:01:40,079 --> 01:01:41,920
but as far as the political scenario

1782
01:01:41,920 --> 01:01:43,599
goes i feel

1783
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,599
that state governments provincial

1784
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:48,240
governments need to start engaging

1785
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:52,319
the union government more um and not

1786
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:55,440
play such a passive role in how the

1787
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:57,280
internet is regulated

1788
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:00,240
because it has an impact on the lives of

1789
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:01,119
people

1790
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:02,480
and state governments have a

1791
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:04,799
responsibility to safeguard that

1792
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,000
and not leave all of this just in the

1793
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:08,799
hands of

1794
01:02:08,799 --> 01:02:11,920
of sort of the union government i would

1795
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:14,079
say

1796
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,760
yeah thank you finally sushant if you

1797
01:02:21,760 --> 01:02:25,520
had any final comments

1798
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,720
i mean sort of mainly

1799
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:34,160
the problem of as

1800
01:02:34,160 --> 01:02:35,920
i mean the new rules aren't addressing

1801
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,520
the big tech problems or the hate

1802
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:38,720
related issues

1803
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:41,039
that are really there when the new rules

1804
01:02:41,039 --> 01:02:43,359
are just weaponizing

1805
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,520
government control over what can be

1806
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,559
given out

1807
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:49,599
or what can be available online so in

1808
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,440
that respect the rules are

1809
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,119
nothing to do with actually controlling

1810
01:02:53,119 --> 01:02:54,559
the big tech

1811
01:02:54,559 --> 01:02:56,720
i mean it is just it is just to make

1812
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:58,720
sure all platforms actually obey what

1813
01:02:58,720 --> 01:02:59,920
government does

1814
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:02,400
and which is very um different

1815
01:03:02,400 --> 01:03:04,000
perspective on what free speech should

1816
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:06,079
be on

1817
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:08,559
so i think the new rule should be just

1818
01:03:08,559 --> 01:03:11,280
completely taken down and

1819
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,000
new and new

1820
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,599
approach should be taken on what to do

1821
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:19,200
with hate speech and other problems that

1822
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:20,240
happen

1823
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:21,760
and the law and the order problems that

1824
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,000
happen this is

1825
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:28,480
this is not needful at all

1826
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:31,520
yeah absolutely thank you for that and

1827
01:03:31,520 --> 01:03:32,960
it goes to something guy i mentioned at

1828
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:34,640
the beginning also that

1829
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:36,160
you know this is really not really help

1830
01:03:36,160 --> 01:03:37,760
it's not going to help

1831
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:38,400
it's probably going to

1832
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:41,119
disproportionately affect um communities

1833
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:42,880
that are already at risk

1834
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,559
and already face a lot of hate speech

1835
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:46,720
online um

1836
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:48,000
drama i was wondering if you had any

1837
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:49,920
final comments or

1838
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,880
additional questions i'm just very clear

1839
01:03:52,880 --> 01:03:53,760
you know glad

1840
01:03:53,760 --> 01:03:55,280
fantastic paneling people who've been

1841
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:56,960
here and i think what people should also

1842
01:03:56,960 --> 01:03:58,240
know and take away is this

1843
01:03:58,240 --> 01:03:59,839
the fact that this is so important and i

1844
01:03:59,839 --> 01:04:01,280
was just struck by the fact that

1845
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:02,960
india has come up in the comments of two

1846
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:04,480
significant tech company

1847
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,160
you know executives were spoken at rice

1848
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:07,839
con in the comments of matthew prince

1849
01:04:07,839 --> 01:04:08,880
who noted that

1850
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:10,960
in fact between the sometimes polarized

1851
01:04:10,960 --> 01:04:13,039
positions of china and the united states

1852
01:04:13,039 --> 01:04:14,640
he's been looking at two other nodes for

1853
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:16,079
like influence and regulation which is

1854
01:04:16,079 --> 01:04:17,359
the european union

1855
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:18,960
doing things in the careful considered

1856
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:20,559
way not always right but they're doing

1857
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,920
it in a careful manner and he's that

1858
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:22,559
said

1859
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,160
india was perhaps the most important one

1860
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,760
he was looking at very

1861
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:27,920
very important but one which he was very

1862
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,520
concerned was taking a position actually

1863
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:30,240
much more

1864
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:31,839
closer to the sort of authoritarian

1865
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:33,839
position that some people in china take

1866
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:34,960
which is troubling him and

1867
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,559
that troubled me as an indian who tracks

1868
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:38,240
and knows the impact india can have

1869
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:40,480
on democracies globally which david k

1870
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:41,520
talked about so that

1871
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:42,960
is also talked about others have talked

1872
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,559
about the impact we have in the region

1873
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:45,359
and i think therefore

1874
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:47,280
there's a burden on all indian policy

1875
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,359
makers whether those who serve

1876
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:50,799
in the elected central government prime

1877
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:52,400
minister modi's ministers and the civil

1878
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,200
servants

1879
01:04:53,200 --> 01:04:55,039
who eat them and who appointed public

1880
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,559
office judges

1881
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,720
regulators whoever might be there to fix

1882
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:00,319
this and particularly

1883
01:05:00,319 --> 01:05:02,720
immediately put pause and perhaps rewind

1884
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:03,520
on these idea

1885
01:05:03,520 --> 01:05:05,839
rules to fix other measures in terms of

1886
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:06,880
the broken

1887
01:05:06,880 --> 01:05:08,799
system we have a web censorship in india

1888
01:05:08,799 --> 01:05:10,400
the first step of addressing a problem

1889
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:12,000
is acknowledging we have a problem

1890
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,599
and then going towards talking about it

1891
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:15,760
and fixing it and then taking our sort

1892
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:16,559
of position

1893
01:05:16,559 --> 01:05:18,160
where india truly i think can shine

1894
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:20,240
globally as a sort of champion for

1895
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:22,480
free expression democracy that we wish

1896
01:05:22,480 --> 01:05:23,520
to be and also

1897
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,599
an effective rights respecting approach

1898
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:26,880
to regulating big tech

1899
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,319
you know i would have preferred 2021

1900
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,839
where we had a strong data protection

1901
01:05:29,839 --> 01:05:30,640
privacy law

1902
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:32,640
an independent privacy commission strong

1903
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,079
protections of government

1904
01:05:34,079 --> 01:05:35,599
you know surveillance and national

1905
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,839
security measures and our approach to

1906
01:05:37,839 --> 01:05:39,280
regulating big tech that other

1907
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:40,480
democracies would be

1908
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:42,640
tempted to follow and instead we have

1909
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:43,760
following situation where

1910
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,280
other democracies at the very least

1911
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,280
should avoid or learn the mistakes of

1912
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,319
what india has been doing

1913
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,760
the last few months but again there's

1914
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:51,440
space to change this and i hope

1915
01:05:51,440 --> 01:05:53,039
that can be done and i think it takes

1916
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:54,720
all of us to engage more and i just

1917
01:05:54,720 --> 01:05:55,920
wanted to thank people for taking time

1918
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,359
out to talk about this because i think

1919
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,960
we all care very deeply on this topic

1920
01:05:58,960 --> 01:05:59,440
whether

1921
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:02,079
we're in the press activism tech or

1922
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:03,599
wider communities tracking

1923
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:04,960
not just the future of the internet but

1924
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:06,319
the present of the internet india is the

1925
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:08,079
second largest internet user base in the

1926
01:06:08,079 --> 01:06:10,319
world

1927
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,480
yeah thank you for that um and thanks

1928

1929
