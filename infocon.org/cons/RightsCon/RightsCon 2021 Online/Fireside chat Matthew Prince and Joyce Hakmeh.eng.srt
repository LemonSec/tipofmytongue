a london-based think tank and i'm the

9
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
co-editor of the journal of cyber policy

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:43,040
the unprecedented digital adoption that

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,239
we have been witnessing

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,559
since the start of the pandemic has

13
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:47,280
shown how

14
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
important and indispensable digital

15
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,360
technologies are

16
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,680
and for the millions of people who have

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,360
transitioned at speed

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,760
into a more virtual way of living the

19
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,480
benefits

20
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:01,520
as well as the risks abound in this

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
chart we will be focusing on the

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,600
exponential use of the internet

23
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,360
during the pandemic and what the

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,000
implications of this increased use are

25
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,080
in particular from a resilience point of

26
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,840
view it has become

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,400
clearer that this rapid and unplanned

28
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,360
for

29
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,520
digital adoption has brought new

30
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,680
opportunities for cyber attacks

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,119
whether against critical national

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,799
infrastructure including

33
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,040
health healthcare institutions to small

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
and medium enterprises

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,479
and attacks against the individual

36
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,920
internet users

37
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,600
we will look at some of the big

38
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,600
cybersecurity trends and lessons that

39
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,560
we've learned

40
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,600
from this past year asking about what

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,200
needs to happen to increase

42
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,360
the resilience against these attacks

43
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,640
what kind of mindset

44
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,759
policies and tools are needed um so i'll

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:49,600
be taking questions towards the end of

46
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,479
this session

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,560
so please do use the chat function to

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,520
add those there

49
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,240
and i'll try and ask matthew as many as

50
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,200
i can

51
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,439
uh hi matthew and it's great to have you

52
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
with us uh today

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,240
thank you so much brilliant so as

54
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,560
uh the ceo of a company that works in

55
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,479
over 100 countries

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,038
which mission is to help build a better

57
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:11,760
internet

58
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,599
what are some of the big trends that you

59
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,760
have seen in relation to the internet

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,760
since the start of the pandemic

61
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,920
how and how did they impact your work

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,080
and how did you cope

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,440
yeah you know this last year has been uh

64
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,879
a remarkably challenging time for the

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:29,360
internet

66
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,760
a challenging time for cloudflare but

67
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,560
also i think a time that has helped us

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
recognize how important the internet is

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:37,760
for keeping

70
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
keeping people connected and keeping

71
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,040
them online

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,920
this time last year our team was working

73
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,800
around the clock

74
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,959
scrambling in order to make sure that

75
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,080
our systems

76
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,239
could continue to cope with what was

77
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,400
just unprecedented demand

78
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,800
uh for internet access uh over the

79
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,280
course of about three weeks

80
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
uh on a global basis we saw in many

81
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:00,959
places

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,080
as much as uh as doubling of

83
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,959
internet demand and a real shift in when

84
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,239
that demand was

85
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,360
was being requested and so uh

86
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,599
the you know the the the late senator

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,879
ted stevens

88
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,720
uh got a lot of flack for saying that

89
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,840
the internet is is a series of tubes

90
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,720
but as one of the companies that uh that

91
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,480
helps make sure the internet continues

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,360
to flow

93
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,599
at some level that analogy is is a

94
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,959
pretty good analogy uh

95
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:30,560
the internet is at some level just a

96
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,959
series of tubes and those tubes have

97
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,000
a finite capacity and when

98
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,720
when we saw doubling of internet usage

99
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,360
in such a short amount of time

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,239
the internet got to some breaking points

101
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:44,560
and

102
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,480
it was only because of the work of a

103
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,959
number of of companies working together

104
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,280
to make sure that in those choke points

105
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,799
in those limited regions

106
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,360
uh the internet could continue to to

107
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:55,920
flow

108
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,239
um i you know i i think we are still in

109
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,560
the middle of a pandemic there's still a

110
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,760
lot of people who

111
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,920
are are suffering a lot of people who

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,959
are dying

113
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,360
around the world and we need to be very

114
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,799
cognizant of that

115
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:11,439
and obviously the superheroes of this

116
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,200
period of time have been

117
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,480
you know the front line medical

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,720
responders and the scientists

119
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,880
who have you know taken care of the sick

120
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,639
and and miraculously

121
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,360
uh found vaccines uh that seem very

122
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,400
effective

123
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,479
uh for for this disease as quickly as

124
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:27,440
possible

125
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,440
but you know i think our entire team is

126
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,560
proud

127
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,400
of the fact that that we have been sort

128
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,080
of the faithful sidekick

129
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,000
along with that and for those people who

130
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,280
could continue

131
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,560
to connect uh with with their their work

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,639
with their loved ones and others in a

133
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,919
virtual way

134
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,280
uh the fact that the internet has

135
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,120
continued to work has has been one of

136
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,320
the things that

137
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:51,040
that has has really i think held held a

138
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,479
bunch of society together and

139
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,960
and i imagine just how much worse this

140
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,160
could have been

141
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,080
uh had it happened just even 10 years

142
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,320
ago when we didn't have technologies

143
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
like this to be able to connect to

144
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,600
connect people reliably together

145
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,440
uh and i i think that illustrates how

146
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,600
important uh the internet is and

147
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,400
hopefully

148
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
uh will be a lesson that we remember for

149
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
some time to come

150
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,560
thanks matthew you talked about how the

151
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,199
internet got to a breaking point and how

152
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:20,800
you know a bunch of companies had to

153
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,320
work together to keep it going can you

154
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,160
tell us a little bit more about that

155
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,479
what were the main essential elements to

156
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,199
keep this

157
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:29,440
the internet going and to not break

158
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,800
after all this pressure that you talked

159
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,759
about

160
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,520
sure so you know i think that the place

161
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,039
where we you know we saw

162
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,759
we saw local challenges around the world

163
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,880
so at some level

164
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,120
uh just some background on cloudflare so

165
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,199
at cloudflare we run a global network

166
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:44,240
that spans

167
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,880
more than 200 cities uh worldwide in

168
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,560
more than 100 countries

169
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,479
and we make sure the internet continues

170
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,680
to flow

171
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:53,440
both making sure that the performance is

172
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,360
good under normal circumstances

173
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
and that if there is some sort of cyber

174
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,280
attack or cyber event that we're able to

175
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,360
stop that um as well and so i think that

176
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,319
there have been

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:05,280
a number of different stages of of

178
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,720
challenges for the internet over the

179
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,440
course

180
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,080
of the last 15 months um the first was

181
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,039
simply a

182
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,080
a usage and utilizations uh stage

183
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,680
and in in various places around the

184
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,000
world where internet infrastructure

185
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,080
may not be as built out especially the

186
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,759
underlying backbones that connect the

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,880
internet together

188
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,800
uh there were definitely points in time

189
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,440
where those metaphorical pipes

190
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,520
uh got almost to their their bursting

191
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,280
point you can't imagine many

192
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,759
public utilities that if all of a sudden

193
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:35,120
they had twice as much

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,360
much usage overnight would continue to

195
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,039
function the sewer system having twice

196
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:41,199
as much usage the electrical grid

197
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:43,039
uh the the freeway system you know they

198
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:44,960
would all come grinding to a halt

199
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,120
and the internet largely continued to

200
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,800
work although there were places around

201
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,520
the world

202
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,400
where we really saw strain europe uh was

203
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,919
one of those places where

204
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,599
a lot of the infrastructure there got

205
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,199
right to the edge of its its breaking

206
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:57,759
point

207
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,280
and that required companies like

208
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,520
cloudflare but also other companies that

209
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,000
were were

210
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,800
providing what were some non-essential

211
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,440
usage

212
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,440
usage of the internet so companies like

213
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,960
netflix or disney

214
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,240
uh which voluntarily decreased their bit

215
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:12,960
rates for

216
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,880
streaming in order to make sure they

217
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
were just literally less bits flowing

218
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,199
through

219
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,759
through the the proverbial pipes to make

220
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,319
sure that

221
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,240
that happened and i think what was

222
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,160
really rewarding about that

223
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,080
uh was to watch as companies that

224
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
were all involved in making sure the

225
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,199
internet worked

226
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
uh collaborated together in order to do

227
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
the right thing to make sure that those

228
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,880
essential bits

229
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,280
that needed to flow uh were were

230
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,080
available

231
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,000
while still making sure that people

232
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,440
could be entertained and

233
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,720
and could communicate with their

234
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,639
families and friends and and other

235
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:47,919
things and i think that that was

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,440
that was sort of the first stage of the

237
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,599
challenges i think the second stage

238
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:53,759
um which happened sort of starting in

239
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,879
mid-summer

240
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,599
of last year was that there was then a

241
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,039
dramatic uptick

242
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:01,440
in the number of cyber attacks uh that

243
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,520
were that were launched at first

244
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,000
uh they had the characteristics of you

245
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
know what we call

246
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,520
board kid attacks um cyber attacks uh

247
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:10,400
tick up

248
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,599
every year as as school lets out uh and

249
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:14,319
kids who

250
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:15,599
are sort of smart and don't have

251
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,840
anything better to do uh go home and

252
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,919
and uh and literally you know launch

253
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,240
cyber attacks to entertain themselves

254
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,800
um but unfortunately it shifted uh

255
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
fairly quickly to then

256
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
targeting um what were uh much more

257
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,240
sophisticated attacks

258
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,799
both criminals uh taking advantage of

259
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,599
the fact that

260
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,519
more people were working at home and

261
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,279
therefore didn't have the same

262
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,799
kind of protections that their their

263
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,880
company might might afford to them

264
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,679
and then uh secondly uh in in

265
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,200
unfortunately in some cases

266
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,600
what appear to be nation state actors uh

267
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,240
targeting

268
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,560
oftentimes healthcare infrastructure in

269
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,320
order to embarrass some parts of the

270
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:52,880
world

271
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,000
uh presumably uh and and slow the roll

272
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,560
out

273
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,080
of critical care um we saw that we were

274
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
super concerned about that we provided

275
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,480
our services at no cost to anyone who is

276
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,720
experiencing uh those types of attacks

277
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
and one of the things that we did

278
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:11,120
was actually provide our our services to

279
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,399
small businesses

280
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:15,040
uh non-profits other organizations uh

281
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:15,440
that

282
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,279
had people working from home in order to

283
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,880
make sure that

284
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,800
uh that they could continue to to

285
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,080
operate and we did that

286
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,000
at no cost because we knew that it was

287
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
it was an important thing uh for us to

288
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,240
do

289
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,720
i think the last stage has been really

290
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,680
um in the

291
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:33,040
the beginning of 2021 as uh

292
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,600
as countries are really rolling out the

293
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:37,279
infrastructure to deliver

294
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,399
vaccines uh for their populace

295
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,320
again we've seen that this is this

296
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,080
requires the internet to be able to

297
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
coordinate

298
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
it's something that um that we're that

299
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:48,640
we're keenly aware of we we stepped

300
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,560
forward and volunteered our services

301
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,200
to provide the infrastructure for any

302
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,399
vaccine

303
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,000
distribution related services through

304
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,839
what we call project fair shot

305
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,000
at no cost i think other companies like

306
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,480
akamai and google and microsoft

307
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,000
have also stepped up to do something

308
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,079
similar and i think that that's been an

309
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:06,880
important part

310
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,839
of making sure that the vaccine rollout

311
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,600
has gone as well as it has in the places

312
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,120
around the world where it's been able to

313
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,040
to go well but you know we continue to

314
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,600
watch with a significant amount of

315
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,240
concern

316
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:20,640
uh regions like india uh that are that

317
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,440
are obviously still

318
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
very much suffering and we i think it's

319
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,040
important that we recognize

320
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,399
that we are still in the middle of a

321
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,000
pandemic and it's important for

322
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,200
companies like ours

323
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,680
government institutions individuals

324
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,920
organizations to all be working together

325
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,920
in order to deliver the services that we

326
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,040
can in order to help

327
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,079
hopefully get through this as as a as a

328
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,120
as a society globally as quickly as we

329
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:45,200
can

330
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,160
uh thank you amazing so just we talked

331
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,440
about the uptick in

332
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,000
in cyber attacks and we have been seeing

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
an increasing number

334
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
uh of ransomware attacks specifically

335
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
against critical national infrastructure

336
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,600
including obviously the latest one

337
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
against the u.s colonial pipe

338
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:02,880
what do you think are some of the

339
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,600
elements that are enabling this increase

340
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,160
and what is really needed to disrupt

341
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,000
this trend

342
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,959
yeah i think you know i think there's um

343
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,160
i think there's sort of a

344
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,720
good news story and a bad news story uh

345
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,120
here so starting with the bad news story

346
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,399
um the bad news is that unfortunately

347
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:22,800
there

348
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,079
there remains a lot of um

349
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,120
legacy aging infrastructure uh that

350
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,079
relies on

351
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,200
out-of-date technologies uh that that

352
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,640
are relatively easy

353
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
uh to to compromise and we've seen that

354
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,160
with a number

355
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:41,120
of stories here these are not um you

356
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,680
know

357
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,720
incredibly sophisticated uh attacks

358
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,200
um they they are largely exploiting

359
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,160
either somebody

360
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
um inadvertently clicking on a link in

361
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,839
an email

362
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,839
or having used a not particularly secure

363
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:56,160
uh

364
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,440
password um and and unfortunately

365
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,880
um once an attacker is able to get

366
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,639
into some part of of the infrastructure

367
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,639
uh that that they are then able to

368
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:10,000
spread out and cause you know

369
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,360
significant harm

370
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
uh to to uh to to organizations and

371
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,320
we've seen that

372
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,279
uh now in a number of very high profile

373
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:19,680
uh

374
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,240
incidents that's not changed that's been

375
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:22,959
the case

376
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
uh for a while and so the question is

377
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,399
what is it that has

378
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,519
has changed and you know i i think the

379
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,519
potentially good news

380
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:34,800
uh around around this is that um i think

381
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:35,279
that

382
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,839
that the hackers are under the

383
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,760
impression and i think it's a correct

384
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,399
uh correct impression that the world is

385
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:43,279
starting to take

386
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:45,120
these sorts of attacks significantly

387
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,560
more seriously

388
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,680
than uh than than we have in the past

389
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,600
and and the hackers sort of understand

390
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,800
that if

391
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
all of a sudden you see crackdowns on

392
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,440
this activity around the world

393
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,920
then then their days of being able to

394
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,000
use the the exploits that they have

395
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,800
are are somewhat numbered and in that

396
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:05,600
sense

397
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,680
um i think that you are seeing a lot

398
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,040
that is getting thrown

399
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,639
at sort of the proverbial wall right now

400
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,880
uh looking for any sorts of

401
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,320
vulnerabilities because i think that

402
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,600
there is a sense

403
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,240
in the hacking community that uh that

404
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:20,959
that that

405
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:24,480
the window for for this is is is closing

406
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,279
over time

407
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,200
and the good news is that as we have

408
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,800
seen in the past

409
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,240
uh actions on a on a

410
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:35,120
inter-government level uh taking actions

411
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,399
to control this

412
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,839
it has resulted in decreases in in cyber

413
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:41,440
attacks and and hacking

414
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
uh and so i think that as you see

415
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,519
governments around the world start to

416
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,959
focus on these issues

417
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,120
i'm actually optimistic that we might be

418
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,079
seeing the worst

419
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,920
of of these attacks and that and that

420
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,519
there might be a a

421
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,519
sort of optimism outcome on the other

422
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,519
side that said

423
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,920
we won't get through this until we

424
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,199
modernize the way

425
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:03,120
that our critical infrastructure is

426
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,440
deployed and the best metaphor

427
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,680
that i have for this is that you know

428
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,279
once upon a time if you were building

429
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,000
boats

430
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,240
the way you kept a boat from sinking was

431
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,199
you built the hole

432
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,720
extremely strong and thick and made sure

433
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
that you know it was

434
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,800
it was impenetrable and that's sort of

435
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,399
like people who say you know we need to

436
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,160
write perfect software i think the

437
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,120
challenge is

438
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,240
there can always be one bad weld or one

439
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,360
weak rivet

440
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:32,639
that if it's burst in an old school boat

441
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,240
once water starts getting in you can

442
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,680
sink the entire boat

443
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,399
and so what i think the new approach to

444
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,399
security and what you know we

445
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,959
use ourselves and what our services that

446
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,079
we provide to

447
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:46,720
to our customers and to our partners uh

448
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:47,120
through

449
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,120
through projects like project galileo

450
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,320
are what we think of

451
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,600
as almost the equivalent of bulkheads in

452
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,320
a boat

453
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,079
because there is always going to be some

454
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:58,160
vulnerability there will always be some

455
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,519
person who accidentally

456
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,000
clicks on a link but when that happens

457
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,920
what you have to make sure is that the

458
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,600
damage that can be done from that is

459
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,360
contained so like in a boat

460
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,600
if there's one bad rivet that springs a

461
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,040
leak if you have bulkheads

462
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,639
that doesn't fill the entire boat with

463
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,560
water that just fills one one particular

464
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,360
bulkhead

465
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,519
and it is much less of a of a concern

466
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,399
and so i think

467
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,839
that move to a new uh

468
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,000
way of approaching security which is has

469
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,760
been known in the industry as a zero

470
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,440
trust approach to security

471
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,880
i think that's the equivalent of

472
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,480
building bulkheads in the boat and i

473
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,480
think the good news is that we're seeing

474
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,079
more and more companies adopt those

475
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,279
sorts of solutions

476
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,600
and that that can really help us have a

477
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,040
much more secure

478
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:43,040
uh critical infrastructure going forward

479
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,680
so some of the uh you know experts when

480
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,440
they comment on ransomware attacks and

481
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,880
the increase also mention

482
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,279
the uh the business model and how it's

483
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,560
actually profitable for

484
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,480
uh for criminals that you know

485
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,240
organizations who are being

486
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,360
uh subject to ransomware attacks are

487
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,360
sometimes paying the ransom against the

488
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,120
advice of law enforcement so if you

489
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
don't break that cycle

490
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,360
you're not really able to break the the

491
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:08,160
ransomware

492
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,639
uh you know trend what are your views on

493
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,160
this

494
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,720
well you know i think that um i mean our

495
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,759
advice

496
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,720
would always be to not pay uh people who

497
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:18,959
are

498
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:20,480
who are sending you ransomware but

499
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,240
that's easy to say

500
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,360
you know today it's hard when

501
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,000
you you know you need to get your

502
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
systems online

503
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,920
in order to process and and deliver fuel

504
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,440
across the you know eastern seaboard of

505
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,639
the united states you have to get your

506
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,279
systems online in order to deliver

507
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:40,320
um you know critical parts of of the the

508
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,920
food and and uh and um agricultural

509
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,120
supply chain

510
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,320
and so you know i think that um i i

511
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,839
i have i have sympathy for the

512
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,079
the teams at these at these companies

513
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:55,759
that come under these attacks

514
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,639
uh and their their their need to get

515
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,680
their systems back

516
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,880
online and so i think that um

517
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,760
that that it's it is it is important

518
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,599
that we break that cycle

519
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
um but i think it's going to be you know

520
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,880
even before

521
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,079
uh ransomware you had lots of ways that

522
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,839
that criminals were able to you know

523
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,160
extort uh

524
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:20,079
other other companies and this is sort

525
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,839
of the modern equivalent

526
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,480
of of you know the guy walking into the

527
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,599
store and saying

528
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,359
you know you got a great store here

529
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,880
shame it shame if it

530
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,120
if it burned down um i can make sure

531
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,559
that doesn't happen if you you know

532
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,360
leave a bag of cash on on on the on the

533
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,080
counter so

534
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
this is a business model that is it

535
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,400
extends way beyond and is

536
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,760
is way older than uh than than

537
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:45,919
than computers or the internet or or

538
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:46,880
ransomware

539
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,960
and so i i think it would be great if we

540
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:51,360
can uh find ways to disrupt

541
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,720
uh that business model but

542
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,880
foundationally what we should also be

543
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,720
doing is working to make sure that

544
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,120
that businesses are more secure

545
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,880
organizations are more secure

546
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,720
and that we have those tools in a way

547
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
that is easy to use

548
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,960
affordable accessible to anyone who's

549
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,559
online and that's that's really what our

550
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,039
mission is at cloudflare

551
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:14,640
you talked about how a lot of the um

552
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,000
you know when you were referring to the

553
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,840
bad news you said the legacy

554
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,600
infrastructure is actually making all of

555
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,080
this or a lot of these attacks happen

556
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,559
in the first place and i'm interested in

557
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,280
your views

558
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,600
as to the tools and tactics that are

559
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,120
being used by the perpetrators because

560
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,120
what you said suggests that actually

561
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,799
they're not very sophisticated

562
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:35,200
they just use legacy or like are made

563
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,039
you know benefiting from the legacy or

564
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:37,679
someone

565
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,000
the lack of cyber hygiene perhaps within

566
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:40,720
uh

567
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,120
employees that they are able to do that

568
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,880
attacks are you how would you describe

569
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,480
the sophistication

570
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,360
of uh the level of the perpetrators who

571
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,240
are inflicting

572
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,919
a lot of harm would you say that they

573
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:54,080
are increasing in sophistication using

574
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,480
more emerging technologies should we be

575
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,440
worried about how

576
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:00,400
where you know where this might go so i

577
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,799
think

578
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:04,240
um so it depends

579
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,720
so so it depends on on what the target

580
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,360
is

581
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,919
uh if you know a lot of people who are

582
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:10,799
in the audience

583
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,840
um for for rights gone um

584
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:17,120
have have real reason to worry about

585
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,480
very sophisticated uh targeted

586
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:23,520
nation state attacks um and and in those

587
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,559
cases

588
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:27,919
the goal of the attack is to um

589
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,200
be extremely precise uh to

590
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
um ideally leave no notice that

591
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,520
uh that an attack has taken place and

592
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,240
then

593
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,640
be able to usually for nation state

594
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,640
level espionage reasons

595
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:45,840
be able to observe uh

596
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,280
or or thwart or control how somebody is

597
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:49,840
using

598
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,799
uh technology online and so there are

599
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,320
very sophisticated

600
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,280
actors out there using what are uh

601
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,400
sophisticated

602
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
exploits to go after individuals

603
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:04,320
um but but that is that is and and we

604
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
should worry about that that issue but i

605
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:06,960
think that that is a

606
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,200
different issue than something like the

607
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,960
colonial pipeline attack

608
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,559
in the case of the colonial pipeline

609
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,400
attack the goal is to

610
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,760
find an organization uh that you can

611
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,000
get into and then actually create as

612
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,600
much chaos

613
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,200
as you can across that organization

614
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,400
making it impossible for that

615
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,360
organization

616
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,799
uh to do uh to do their job and so while

617
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,720
it may be possible to use sophisticated

618
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,720
very uh targeted uh attacks

619
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:40,320
um the the that tends not to align with

620
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,840
the business models

621
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,120
of of the of those attackers um because

622
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,799
once those attacks are known once

623
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:48,320
they've once they've been

624
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
uh disclosed they get closed down um

625
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,480
relatively quickly

626
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,520
and uh and so and so it often is

627
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
is is something where you know in one

628
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,280
case with sophistication you want to be

629
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,240
subtle

630
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,960
and clandestine in in the case of these

631
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
ransomware attacks it's it's quite the

632
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:05,600
opposite

633
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,080
and so in most of the cases that we're

634
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:08,960
seeing

635
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,159
the um the fundamental problem is is a

636
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:13,600
relatively

637
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,640
uh is a relatively um

638
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,600
uh simplistic type of attack in most of

639
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,280
these ransomware um

640
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,400
cases and good cyber hygiene is the

641
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,240
right thing in order to protect that

642
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,840
i think there is a different set of

643
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,240
challenges around protecting individuals

644
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,320
that might be targeted by sophisticated

645
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:33,919
nation-state level attacks

646
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,360
um but but but we shouldn't necessarily

647
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,240
uh you know combine those two things

648
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:40,960
into one

649
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,400
into one category i think you have to

650
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,080
sort of understand what

651
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:46,720
your attack surface is uh and what your

652
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,080
risk profile is

653
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,080
and hopefully those people who again are

654
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:51,440
in the audience that are

655
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,799
uh that are that are thinking about um

656
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,280
that they might be targets are already

657
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,000
practicing a lot

658
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,799
of the of the good hygiene around

659
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,240
password security two-factor

660
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,360
authentication

661
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,360
making sure that um that your devices

662
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,400
are up to date

663
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,360
uh and practicing other good protections

664
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
uh because because again i think

665
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,640
you do have a a different level of

666
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,480
security and different level of threats

667
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,640
but for the most part the sort of

668
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,320
ransomware attacks that we see in the

669
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,039
news

670
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,280
are you know start with and and are

671
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,960
really facilitated by

672
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,840
relatively simple uh attacks that that

673
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,960
don't require

674
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
um you know a level of sophistication

675
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
that we see in in other parts of the

676
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,720
space

677
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:34,720
uh if we look at it's just a kind of

678
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,159
like moving to the what

679
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:39,280
what sort of response is available and

680
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,159
what countries are

681
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:41,919
doing to deal with those uh with those

682
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,400
challenges so if we look at countries

683
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
around the world we see for example

684
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,400
around you know over 140

685
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,960
and maybe 148 now countries have adopted

686
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
cyber security strategies

687
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,360
uh some of them for the very first time

688
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
we see an increased amount of

689
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,080
public private initiatives on cyber

690
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,840
security and generally more talks and

691
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,679
policy circuits about the importance of

692
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:05,200
cyber security

693
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:06,960
so as someone who works around the world

694
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,640
would you say that we have reached the

695
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
needed level of awareness

696
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:12,240
at the government level to be able to

697
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,760
deal with these challenges or do you

698
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,600
think this is still confined

699
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:18,720
to a small a number of countries

700
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
well again i think it goes back to what

701
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,240
might be the good news

702
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:25,039
uh of out of what feels like a really

703
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,679
bad

704
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,760
uh series of events over over the last

705
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,799
several months

706
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:31,679
and that is that i think that there is a

707
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,159
growing awareness around governments

708
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,840
that this is a extremely destructive

709
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:40,960
uh and disruptive uh type of attack

710
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,919
which which can

711
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,640
which can risk critical infrastructure

712
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,039
and

713
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,919
risk the health and well-being of of

714
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:49,520
citizens and so

715
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:52,400
and i think in part because uh a number

716
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,640
of cyber attackers are concerned

717
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,400
about government efforts to crack down

718
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
on this that that we are that that

719
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,840
actually is driving

720
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,720
more of them to try to cause as much

721
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:03,360
harm

722
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,200
in in the short term as possible we have

723
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,520
seen even you know just in the last uh

724
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:08,559
several months

725
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,320
a dramatic uptick in in both the

726
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,440
ransomware cyber locker attacks but also

727
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,559
ddos

728
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:19,679
ransoms um as well and it feels almost

729
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,799
like a a level of of just

730
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,559
almost um uh sort of

731
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,840
sort of almost energy before

732
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,240
uh before sort of a coming a coming

733
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,360
crackdown

734
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,640
on uh on on what's there so i do think

735
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,919
that governments are increasingly

736
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,120
recognizing this

737
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,600
as as a concern i do think that they are

738
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,400
are um

739
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,000
are are starting to think about how to

740
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
crack down on it one of the things

741
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,480
though that i think is

742
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:49,679
is incredibly important uh and and and

743
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,840
and critical for this audience to be

744
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,039
thinking about

745
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,360
is that there's a there will be a

746
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,559
temptation

747
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:58,640
uh as governments around the world start

748
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,480
to think about how to control

749
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:03,679
cyber security for them to lump in

750
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:06,720
other things such as journalism that

751
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:07,840
they don't like

752
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,960
or you know dissident behavior there and

753
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,600
try to

754
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,279
lump thing what we've seen time and time

755
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,120
and time again is that

756
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,840
sort of the cyber attacker who who shuts

757
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,480
down

758
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,679
uh you know a pipeline by by infecting a

759
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:22,480
computer

760
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,120
gets lumped into the same category as a

761
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:27,760
group that is protesting in the streets

762
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,600
over government corruption and i think

763
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,679
that it's important for this community

764
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,000
to be watching very carefully as

765
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,440
governments take action

766
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
and very rarely because again we have to

767
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:39,600
make sure

768
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,600
that the internet continues to live up

769
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,760
to its ideals and as we

770
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:46,000
uh as we enact as there is government

771
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,000
action to try to control

772
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:51,200
uh what what uh how cyber attacks uh

773
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,320
work online and

774
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,120
and and and keep them in in place that

775
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,000
that doesn't slip

776
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,960
into uh other censorship or other um

777
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:01,200
ways that that governments might want to

778
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,960
control how how the internet works and

779
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,559
how speech is uh

780
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,120
is delivered online so you're talking

781
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,880
about undesirable content and what some

782
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,679
governments are

783
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,960
doing and we have a question from the

784
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,120
audience here saying that cloudflare

785
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,840
took a bold step in 2019 in removing a

786
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,480
chan

787
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:18,320
can you talk about how and why you

788
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,679
reached that decision

789
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,279
and whether it's still realistic for

790
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:22,880
infrastructure providers to say that

791
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,960
they have no responsibility for content

792
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,799
related issues

793
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:29,200
yeah i don't think that um i don't think

794
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:29,919
that we or

795
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,360
anyone else would say that we don't have

796
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
any responsibility i think the question

797
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,559
is just where that responsibility

798
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:40,880
lies so today about one in six

799
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,760
websites online relies on relies on

800
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:44,960
cloudflare

801
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:46,799
but we are we are the network provider

802
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,799
that sits behind them um you know if you

803
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,400
think about the responsibility for

804
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,200
content

805
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:52,799
which is which is published online you

806
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,559
know the ultimate responsibility

807
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,880
is with the individual who publishes

808
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,000
that content

809
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:01,440
uh then maybe on but below that

810
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,120
might be the platform whether that's

811
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,480
facebook or twitter

812
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:07,120
or shopify or any of any of the other

813
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,880
other platforms that are out there

814
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,840
that sit there below that is the actual

815
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,200
hosting provider

816
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,440
uh that is is below it and then below

817
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,799
that would be someone like us like the

818
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,000
network provider

819
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,039
and then there's infrastructure that

820
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,880
sits even below that like the dns

821
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,720
provider or the registrar

822
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,679
and what i think is is important is that

823
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:27,279
as we think about

824
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,440
what the different roles are um the

825
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,320
answer is not

826
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,320
that you don't have any responsibility

827
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,000
but you want to be very careful so

828
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,440
for instance if we terminate some piece

829
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
of content

830
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,320
uh which is which is flowing through our

831
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:42,399
network but it's also flowing through a

832
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:43,840
particular hosting provider or a

833
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,679
particular platform that sits on top of

834
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,080
it

835
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,559
we're effectively taking away the agency

836
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,399
of those organizations that sit on top

837
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:51,200
of us

838
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
in order to make decisions that are

839
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,440
aligned with whatever their own

840
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,760
abuse policies are their own principles

841
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,000
are and so i think the further that you

842
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,360
go down in the stack

843
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,159
the more careful and more deliberate you

844
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:05,120
have to be

845
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,520
in making those those decisions in the

846
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:08,880
case of h-chan

847
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,559
you know i think that it was one of the

848
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,080
rare times

849
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,880
where we had individuals that were

850
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,399
acting in a way that was

851
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,559
that was um completely outside of the

852
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:19,440
values

853
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,880
of society we had a platform that was

854
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,320
specifically designed

855
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:26,960
to be lawless not responsible to either

856
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,960
the the laws or norms

857
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,520
of of any any societies around the world

858
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,760
and actively trying to thwart

859
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,760
the efforts of law enforcement as they

860
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,000
as they invested crimes that were um

861
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,440
in part uh uh um uh

862
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,919
at least announced on on the platform

863
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,840
you had a hosting provider

864
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,559
that was actually again specifically set

865
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:49,039
up

866
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:51,279
to be outside of the reach of any of

867
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:53,200
society's norms or laws

868
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,480
and then you had us that were sitting

869
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,640
below it and so i think in the ideal

870
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,640
case you would have individuals taking

871
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,640
responsibility for the content that they

872
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,360
create

873
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:03,120
uh if that doesn't happen you would then

874
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,799
you would have the underlying platforms

875
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,240
take that responsibility if that doesn't

876
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:06,799
happen

877
00:29:06,799 --> 00:29:07,840
then the host should take that

878
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,760
responsibility and in the rare cases

879
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,679
where none of those four organizations

880
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:14,000
are willing to take responsibility then

881
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,120
sometimes that's going to fall to

882
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,320
cloudflare in order to take that

883
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,200
responsibility

884
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,360
uh and and do that we want to make that

885
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,240
something that is

886
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,240
is rare uh we want to make that

887
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,240
something that um you know we

888
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,200
we do very deliberately um that that of

889
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,720
course then means that there are times

890
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,240
when there's content that flows through

891
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,520
our network that we're

892
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,600
not proud of and that we that we don't

893
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,360
that we don't personally like

894
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,679
but we think that it's important to

895
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,600
really delineate those different lines

896
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,279
in the technology stack

897
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,760
and and make sure that the underlying

898
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,159
internet itself the network itself

899
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:49,760
is not being used as a way of censoring

900
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,840
uh what content is online because that

901
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,279
that obviously creates

902
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,919
enormous challenges and enormous risks

903
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:56,399
uh

904
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,840
for a lot of the reasons that i was

905
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,039
talking about before in terms of

906
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:01,039
governments regulating

907
00:30:01,039 --> 00:30:04,240
activity on the internet so just

908
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,919
kind of staying on this topic what do

909
00:30:05,919 --> 00:30:07,760
you think are the likely scenarios that

910
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:08,480
we might

911
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,640
be faced with when it comes to uh

912
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,159
content regulation and content

913
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,080
governance what do you think you know

914
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,120
which way are we heading well you know

915
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,840
the

916
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,679
the internet is this massively

917
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,480
disruptive force and i think it's hard

918
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:26,159
to overstate how disruptive

919
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,279
to um

920
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,360
to to traditional and historic

921
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,880
institutions it has been

922
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,799
and um you know for for quite some time

923
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:43,600
there were sort of two models of of

924
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,279
internet regulation one was sort of the

925
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,640
us model

926
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,880
which i think it's hard again to

927
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,159
overstate

928
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,360
how i mean radical

929
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:56,559
the u.s approach to uh freedom of

930
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:57,519
expression

931
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,240
is and it is it is not one that is

932
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:00,880
shared

933
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,039
by by most of the world and yet because

934
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,000
the internet

935
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,960
started there um that radical approach

936
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:08,320
uh is what has

937
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,799
has taken hold um around around most of

938
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:11,360
the world

939
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,360
um up until up until uh you know now

940
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,360
um the other approach was really the

941
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:18,399
chinese approach

942
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,159
and um at some level the chinese

943
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:22,240
approach is is hard to understand

944
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,880
uh for for me as someone who grew up uh

945
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,720
you know in the united states but but i

946
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:27,200
think

947
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,360
it's actually it's actually as as as

948
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,960
i've thought about more it

949
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,919
it is um it's something that that maps

950
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:35,039
to

951
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:38,720
what uh what other uh um other types of

952
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,480
content that are regulated

953
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,640
do around the world so for instance if

954
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,399
you want to start a

955
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:47,200
radio station basically anywhere in the

956
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,840
world

957
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,440
uh you have to apply to whoever the

958
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,120
regulator is in the united states that's

959
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,159
the fcc

960
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:54,720
for a license to be able to broadcast

961
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,919
across a certain

962
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,960
uh spectrum there are rules

963
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,880
uh that allow you you have to broadcast

964
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
at a certain um

965
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:04,320
at a certain uh strength of your

966
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,000
frequency and in the united states there

967
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:07,120
are certain words that you're not

968
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,320
allowed to say

969
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,960
um you know somewhat absurdly uh on on

970
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,320
the on the radio station otherwise the

971
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,640
fcc will will pull your license

972
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,039
uh and and we sort of all accept that

973
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,799
that's the case because

974
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:20,880
um you know if you didn't have some sort

975
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,240
of coordinating body

976
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:25,039
then there would be chaos um presumably

977
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:25,600
because

978
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,360
because you'd have people broadcasting

979
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:29,120
on the same frequency and radio just

980
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,080
won't work

981
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,159
um that's sort of the way that china

982
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,919
thinks about about the internet

983
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,440
is that if you want to put something up

984
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,440
online that is going to be broadcast

985
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,720
from inside of china

986
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,159
you have to have a license to do that

987
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,760
and that license is called an icp

988
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:42,720
license and

989
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,960
there's a process to uh to applying for

990
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,480
it but it's it's very similar

991
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,399
uh to if you were applying for a radio

992
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:49,519
uh license in

993
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:52,640
in the united states with the fcc um

994
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,720
that of course you know creates uh you

995
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,760
know a much

996
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,279
more of a control uh uh plane

997
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:01,840
for the chinese authorities to be able

998
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,440
to control what content

999
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,840
is online and just like uh the fcc

1000
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,240
controls what content is on the radio

1001
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,720
um that the the chinese government does

1002
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,159
that uh online as

1003
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:15,200
as well what i i think that

1004
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,600
the world in general outside of the us

1005
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:18,720
and china

1006
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,480
i think the the challenge right now is

1007
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:23,039
that the world is not totally happy

1008
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:25,440
with either of those models for

1009
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,919
regulating how the internet works

1010
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:30,960
they the world is worried about uh

1011
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,960
the model of anything goes which has

1012
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
kind of been the us model in the past

1013
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,640
and the world isn't quite ready to go to

1014
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,559
the chinese model of we have to approve

1015
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:39,519
everything

1016
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,760
in advance and so the world i think

1017
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,000
right now is looking for what that new

1018
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,559
model is and you have some various uh

1019
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:47,279
centers

1020
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:48,960
around the world that are thinking about

1021
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,600
these issues really well i think europe

1022
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,760
is actually doing a very good job of

1023
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:55,440
thinking about how

1024
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,559
uh and when and in what ways uh the the

1025
00:33:58,559 --> 00:33:59,519
internet uh

1026
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,679
it should be controlled and regulated

1027
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:04,320
and and i i think that um they have been

1028
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
thoughtful at understanding

1029
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:07,760
what the different layers of the

1030
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,918
internet stack are and why

1031
00:34:09,918 --> 00:34:11,839
as you regulate something like facebook

1032
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:13,520
it may not make sense to regulate you

1033
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,280
know the undersea cable operator and

1034
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:16,079
actually been

1035
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:18,079
you know very very very thoughtful about

1036
00:34:18,079 --> 00:34:20,800
how how to uh move forward around that

1037
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,399
and and i think that's the case

1038
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:24,800
i think um the challenge though is is

1039
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,560
whether or not that coalesces into

1040
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
something that can be

1041
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:31,040
a uh a model that the rest of the world

1042
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,760
can follow

1043
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,040
i think the country that i'm watching

1044
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,199
the most closely um and where

1045
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,760
where i think um you know the the likely

1046
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:39,119
kind of new model for internet

1047
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,079
regulation

1048
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,918
uh for better or worse is likely to come

1049
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,520
out of it's gonna be india

1050
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,719
um india you know is is um is i think

1051
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,719
thinking through if they have the

1052
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,599
critical mass and size to really be

1053
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,760
kind of a new anchor for a third way of

1054
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,040
internet regulation

1055
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:58,160
um i think the challenge is that um that

1056
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,240
you know what we're seeing out of it uh

1057
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,599
out of india so far

1058
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:03,760
looks like it is going to error more uh

1059
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:05,760
towards sort of a chinese model

1060
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,359
and and i think that's um that's

1061
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:08,960
something that we all really need to pay

1062
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,960
a lot of attention to and think about

1063
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,800
um whether whether that's something that

1064
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,640
that we want the entire internet to

1065
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:17,359
uh to follow and so i think watch india

1066
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:18,800
extremely carefully and i think that's

1067
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,079
that's where a lot of

1068
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,440
of sort of the future of internet

1069
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,200
regulation is is going to be is going to

1070
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:25,119
be thought through

1071
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,800
thank you for that uh and we have

1072
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,480
another question here from the audience

1073
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,640
asking you that if you could erase one

1074
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:31,520
or two mis

1075
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,359
perceptions about the internet and the

1076
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:36,880
cloud what would they be

1077
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,720
you know um

1078
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:45,119
i used to teach a course

1079
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:50,560
on internet technology and privacy law

1080
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,880
back back back when i back when i was a

1081
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,079
back when i was a

1082
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:57,200
a not very good law professor and one of

1083
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,000
the things

1084
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,640
um you know that students would come in

1085
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,440
and they were

1086
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:04,000
they were um you know they they were

1087
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,119
they're like they were

1088
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:07,520
they're very idealistic um you know they

1089
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,119
sort of had a lot of the same

1090
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:12,000
same um background as i do and and you

1091
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,560
know

1092
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,640
there are just a lot of assumptions on

1093
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:15,680
you know

1094
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:17,280
that the internet is this this almost

1095
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,880
infinite resource and

1096
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:22,160
um and and that that's uh and

1097
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,960
that's and that that it that the way it

1098
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,359
it has been will just continue to grow

1099
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:27,839
and

1100
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:29,839
and that that will be the case over time

1101
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:31,200
and i remember

1102
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,359
one of the things i learned teaching law

1103
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:34,880
was that the same thing that

1104
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,320
that the kids enjoyed when they were in

1105
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:41,040
second or third grade is the same thing

1106
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:41,440
that

1107
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,320
that that law students enjoy uh later on

1108
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:45,520
in their careers which is that their

1109
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:46,400
favorite

1110
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:49,280
day of class was field trips and so we

1111
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,320
would always take i would always take

1112
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,560
them on a field trip to 350 cermak which

1113
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:52,880
is

1114
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,640
um which is the largest data center in

1115
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,560
the world um i was teaching in chicago

1116
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:56,960
and

1117
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,720
so we go down there it's near mccormick

1118
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,400
place off lake shore drive for those of

1119
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,200
you who know

1120
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,480
you know the city it's the old yellow

1121
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:05,200
pages um printing warehouse

1122
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,480
for anyone who remembers what the yellow

1123
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,280
pages were and um and it's turned into

1124
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,960
this giant facility and they

1125
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,800
the impression as you walk through that

1126
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,000
door and you walk through all the

1127
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,200
security

1128
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,119
and and then you know the the different

1129
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:18,320
layers and and

1130
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,720
into the actual facility is like wow

1131
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,599
this is

1132
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,160
there's a lot of there's a lot of atoms

1133
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:24,720
uh

1134
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,480
that are that are involved and a lot of

1135
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,960
electrons uh that that need to flow in

1136
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,160
order for all these bits

1137
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:32,079
um to flow and so i think the first

1138
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,200
thing um i

1139
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,680
i would say is that um you know there

1140
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,800
there is

1141
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,160
the the the internet is um more more

1142
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,440
costly and as a result more fragile

1143
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:45,359
uh to administer than than i think the

1144
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,359
average person knows it feels just

1145
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:48,480
magical

1146
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,320
but behind the scenes there there are a

1147
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,079
lot of people working incredibly hard to

1148
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,040
make sure

1149
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:55,599
uh that it stays online and and the

1150
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,400
reason why

1151
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,440
that then means that it's fragile is

1152
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:01,920
you know that that building 350 cermak

1153
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:02,800
if it were

1154
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,440
if it were to go offline for some reason

1155
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:07,520
would disrupt a huge portion of how

1156
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,000
how the internet works um if if a

1157
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,839
government wanted to control

1158
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:14,880
uh how bits flew fly uh

1159
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,720
across the internet and and what bits

1160
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,000
are there you know there

1161
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,720
are still a relatively uh small set of

1162
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:21,040
of

1163
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,200
organizations and and places around the

1164
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:24,400
world that they

1165
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,720
that they potentially can can do that

1166
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
and so i think it

1167
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:31,280
it is up to all of us to really think

1168
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,400
about um

1169
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,079
you know what is the internet to

1170
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:37,040
recognize the fragility of it

1171
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,920
uh and and to really have agency as we

1172
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:41,599
think about its future

1173
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:43,599
and we think about what how it's going

1174
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:45,280
to be regulated and

1175
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,800
and how it's going to be uh connected to

1176
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,720
and how it's going to be controlled or

1177
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,320
or or uncontrolled

1178
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:56,079
and um and that that that is is a

1179
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,839
an incredibly difficult set of

1180
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:00,800
challenges uh that you know

1181
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,119
i i think are are some of the most

1182
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:04,880
important questions that that we can ask

1183
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:06,000
and it's and it's what

1184
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,920
our entire team and what cloudflare has

1185
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,119
set up uh

1186
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:11,839
to to um be a part of of hopefully

1187
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:13,200
helping solve you know when we say our

1188
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:14,320
mission is to help build a better

1189
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,280
internet

1190
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,359
that means how do we how do we make sure

1191
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:18,720
that anyone

1192
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,200
anywhere in the world who needs to get

1193
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,040
access to the network and all the

1194
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,800
advantages that that brings

1195
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,480
whether they're publishing content or

1196
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,560
consuming content that they can do so in

1197
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:29,760
a way that is

1198
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,880
is um on the same footing and

1199
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,760
on the same level as as you know some of

1200
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,839
the internet giants or or some people

1201
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:38,400
from

1202
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,079
wealthy countries or organizations

1203
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:41,760
around the world and i think that if we

1204
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
can do that

1205
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,480
that really is the internet living up to

1206
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:46,960
to its its best self

1207
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,200
so speaking about like access to your

1208
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,440
products the question to you is

1209
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:53,200
do you think repressive governments

1210
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,040
should have access to cloudflare

1211
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:58,560
products yeah i mean

1212
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,560
an issue we really struggle with um you

1213
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,240
know we are computer scientists more

1214
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,079
than political scientists and so we

1215
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:05,599
really lean on

1216
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:09,119
the um the the people who are in this

1217
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:10,000
audience and

1218
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,960
and and then other experts uh in order

1219
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:13,520
to

1220
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,839
in order to um in order to help us

1221
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:16,560
suggest

1222
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:19,680
uh what to do i think generally uh our

1223
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:22,560
our approach has been that we're we're

1224
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:23,359
we're not

1225
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:25,119
we're not selling the sort of guns and

1226
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:26,720
ammo we're selling the the

1227
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:29,839
the um the the metaphorical

1228
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:32,960
um bulletproof jacket and and we do

1229
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:33,760
think that

1230
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,280
providing access to information um is

1231
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,920
is is something which is is is important

1232
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:40,800
for us to do

1233
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,880
regardless of of whether we agree with

1234
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,560
that information or disagree with that

1235
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:45,440
information

1236
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,839
uh that's online i think it as we start

1237
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:50,319
to make what our editorial decisions on

1238
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:52,400
who can and cannot use our network

1239
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,640
i think it starts us down a path which

1240
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:55,440
is

1241
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,400
a really pretty tricky path for us us to

1242
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,640
head down um you know we terminated

1243
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,920
some really vile neo-nazis uh from

1244
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:07,680
from our our network uh and and within

1245
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:10,880
the next seven days we received over

1246
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,640
three thousand requests

1247
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,440
uh from nation states saying oh here are

1248
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,680
a bunch of organizations that are using

1249
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,599
uh your platform that we don't agree

1250
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,880
with either please

1251
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:23,920
kick them off as well um and and some of

1252
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,640
those were

1253
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,440
um i mean most of those actually were

1254
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:28,319
were very

1255
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:31,200
um uh positive we would be things that

1256
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:31,839
we would

1257
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:33,680
agree with and and we're people who are

1258
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,079
doing hard work um oftentimes reporting

1259
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:36,720
on

1260
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,680
uh corruption and um and and other

1261
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,880
things in the in the

1262
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,440
countries where they they operate so i i

1263
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:43,920
think it's

1264
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:46,319
it's a tough issue and i think we follow

1265
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,040
the guidance

1266
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,839
from uh the the state department in the

1267
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:51,280
united states which is where we which is

1268
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,319
where we operate

1269
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:54,079
and others in order to make sure that we

1270
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:55,920
comply with any sanctions

1271
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,640
uh or or regulations but we are very

1272
00:41:58,640 --> 00:41:59,599
hesitant

1273
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:02,400
to make a unilateral call on you know

1274
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:02,720
this

1275
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:05,200
is this is a government that is is is

1276
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,319
doing something that

1277
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,720
um that you know we we don't agree with

1278
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,000
or we don't approve of

1279
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,520
because we worry about the precedent

1280
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,920
that that sets and uh

1281
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:15,680
and and and again i think it's very

1282
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:17,280
dangerous for someone who who

1283
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,960
operates as low down on the internet as

1284
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:20,640
we do to be making a lot of

1285
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:22,400
determinations on what content is and is

1286
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,920
not online

1287
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:26,800
right um i have a question for you

1288
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,839
around sort of the digital divide and

1289
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:31,760
you know if you look at this um you know

1290
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,440
we talked about the sharp take-up of

1291
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,960
digital technology

1292
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,280
um during the pandemic but has also

1293
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,440
exposed this widening digital divide not

1294
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:40,960
only between the businesses themselves

1295
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:42,560
but also between countries

1296
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,119
and we've you know uh figures from the

1297
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,000
u.n say that

1298
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:47,599
almost half of the world's population is

1299
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:49,040
still offline

1300
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,640
and for those of course uh the

1301
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,000
experience has been different throughout

1302
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:52,880
the pandemic

1303
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
what in your opinion are some of the

1304
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:56,000
actions that are needed

1305
00:42:56,000 --> 00:43:00,240
to help close this divide so

1306
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:02,319
we i mean there there are there are a

1307
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:03,359
number of

1308
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:05,520
there are a number of things uh that

1309
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:07,359
that of course we we have to do

1310
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:09,280
and i think that we need to make it so

1311
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:11,440
that the the internet is uh affordable

1312
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,680
and

1313
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:14,800
accessible to everyone on earth um that

1314
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,400
wants to be that wants to be connected

1315
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:17,040
to it

1316
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:20,000
um i i think i try to to sort of stay in

1317
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:20,800
my lane

1318
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,640
and and talk about those things that

1319
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:23,920
that we can impact

1320
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,359
but one of the things that we're really

1321
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:27,040
thinking about and

1322
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:30,160
and working on is how in

1323
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,960
underserved communities um often often

1324
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,319
rural communities

1325
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:37,200
and those those are you know in in

1326
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:38,880
developing countries but they also can

1327
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:39,200
be

1328
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,599
in developed countries uh in in parts of

1329
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:42,560
the world that

1330
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,800
you know just the the local telecoms

1331
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,400
haven't prioritized

1332
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,880
uh making access to broadband services

1333
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:50,160
but how can we use

1334
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:53,359
cloudflare's reach and our network

1335
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:56,640
in order to help facilitate access

1336
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:00,960
to uh the internet as as as broadly as

1337
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,359
as possible and make sure that

1338
00:44:03,359 --> 00:44:04,880
regardless of where you are on

1339
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:07,119
on on the planet you have access to a

1340
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,040
fast connection now we can't do that

1341
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:09,839
ourselves

1342
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,800
um we don't make uh you know mobile

1343
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:13,520
phones we

1344
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,480
we're unlikely to bid on on radio

1345
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:17,839
spectrum

1346
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,920
but we do want to make sure that if if

1347
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:22,400
you are a local entrepreneur

1348
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,960
or a local telecommunications provider

1349
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,560
that is providing services in

1350
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,839
rural parts of the world how can we then

1351
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,040
help facilitate you providing the best

1352
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:36,160
possible experience to all of

1353
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,720
your customers and do it in a way which

1354
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,720
again doesn't disadvantage you

1355
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,800
uh because you are you are living in a

1356
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:44,560
developing portion of the world or

1357
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,359
or in um you know a rural part of a

1358
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:48,720
developed country

1359
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,280
and and i think that that's um that's

1360
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:52,480
something that

1361
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,400
you know we can help with and i think

1362
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,599
that's something that we are thinking

1363
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:57,119
about and working on

1364
00:44:57,119 --> 00:45:00,319
um and and that's a that i think um

1365
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:02,400
is one of the ways that you know

1366
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,640
companies can think about how

1367
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:07,440
they can provide services uh to to

1368
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,000
connect

1369
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
uh more of the world uh online in our

1370
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,319
case you know we're in

1371
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,880
you know well over 200 countries now uh

1372
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:16,480
uh excuse me well over 100 countries

1373
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,560
well over 200 cities uh now

1374
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:20,160
around the world um you know the

1375
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,000
majority of the customers that pay us

1376
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,640
are are in you know concentrated in in

1377
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,000
the developed world

1378
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,920
but but we really do believe that our

1379
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,680
mission is to to make the internet

1380
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,280
accessible everywhere on earth

1381
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,040
and so that's why you know we continue

1382
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,640
to build out our infrastructure

1383
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,160
um all around the world and if we can

1384
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,839
then use that infrastructure

1385
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:40,079
to help support those less connected

1386
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:40,960
communities

1387
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,319
um i think that that would be something

1388
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:44,240
that that that i would be really proud

1389
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,400
of and and that would would help

1390
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,520
uh you know be one small piece of

1391
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:50,480
helping bridge

1392
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,079
bridge the digital divide but there's

1393
00:45:52,079 --> 00:45:53,680
there's a there's a lot that that we

1394
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,960
have to do and i think it's important

1395
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:55,599
for

1396
00:45:55,599 --> 00:45:57,680
every company that's touching touching

1397
00:45:57,680 --> 00:45:58,800
the internet to think about

1398
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,800
how it is that they can provide that and

1399
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,200
do it in a way that gives people not not

1400
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:03,920
sort of a

1401
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,440
dumbed down version of the internet but

1402
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:06,560
a full and complete version of the

1403
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,839
internet

1404
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:09,280
thank you i'd like to go back a little

1405
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,040
bit to talk me about the sort of public

1406
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:11,920
private

1407
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:13,680
uh partnership that is needed and the

1408
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,960
collaboration

1409
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:16,720
um and going back to those sort of like

1410
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,160
the increased uh

1411
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,680
threats that we are witnessing what do

1412
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,119
you think other lessons that have been

1413
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:21,680
learned

1414
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,640
from recent large-scale uh cyber attacks

1415
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,240
in terms of effective collaboration

1416
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,040
between uh

1417
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,800
governments and the private sector and

1418
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:30,160
what do you think that all of the

1419
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,599
private sector should be i mean how is

1420
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:33,200
it evolving how

1421
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:36,960
how would you like to see it going

1422
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,359
you know so 12 years ago cloudflare was

1423
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,400
just an idea

1424
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,640
on a piece of paper and um

1425
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,040
and you know it took a lot of hard work

1426
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:47,839
from

1427
00:46:47,839 --> 00:46:50,240
from you know all of the team that has

1428
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,520
built built

1429
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,319
the company into what it is today um but

1430
00:46:54,319 --> 00:46:55,680
we couldn't have done it

1431
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,760
without you know a stable and

1432
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:58,800
functioning

1433
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:01,760
government uh that that allowed us to

1434
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,079
make

1435
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,480
make the investments that we needed uh

1436
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:05,680
and and build them

1437
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,119
and build our infrastructure out and

1438
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:09,359
support it and do it in a way that

1439
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,640
that um that that was that was important

1440
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:14,160
and that that's not unique to cloudflare

1441
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,240
that's that's true of any business

1442
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,640
anywhere in the world where you you have

1443
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,440
to work

1444
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,520
with you know the greater community and

1445
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,359
society that you're a part of

1446
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,720
and um you know the the stakeholders

1447
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:28,079
that you serve

1448
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,480
are much broader than just your

1449
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,720
investors or or your employees it's

1450
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,960
you know it is a broader set of

1451
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,480
stakeholders and so i think

1452
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,800
something that has been in our dna from

1453
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,960
the beginning has been always to ask

1454
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,079
how can we work with that broader set of

1455
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:45,200
stakeholders

1456
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:48,319
in order to provide uh services and so

1457
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:50,640
um you know we're we launched project

1458
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,480
galileo which is the

1459
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:55,680
the the the um

1460
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,800
project that gives our services at no

1461
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,800
cost any politically or artistically

1462
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:02,319
important organizations

1463
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:04,480
uh around the world we've worked with a

1464
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:06,640
lot of the civil society organizations

1465
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,520
in order to help us overcome you know

1466
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,040
again our our lack of

1467
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,960
of of real understanding of what are

1468
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,559
uh the organizations that are the most

1469
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:18,559
deserving of that and and worked

1470
00:48:18,559 --> 00:48:20,400
work to do that you know incredibly well

1471
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,520
and i think that that's been a great

1472
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,559
partnership

1473
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:25,760
with with civil society i think the the

1474
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:27,119
example of

1475
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:29,520
for us a partnership with government

1476
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:30,480
that is that

1477
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:32,880
that worked really well was um what we

1478
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:34,480
call the athenian project

1479
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:38,079
um in 2016 i think we watched um

1480
00:48:38,079 --> 00:48:41,839
with with you know really grave concern

1481
00:48:41,839 --> 00:48:44,880
uh as what what i had thought of as

1482
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,800
a you know very stable institution which

1483
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:48,079
were elections

1484
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:51,440
uh in the united states were um

1485
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:54,400
at least called into question by uh

1486
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:55,280
cyber attack

1487
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,000
activities uh around around the world

1488
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,040
and it and it

1489
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,240
felt you know like like the uh

1490
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,480
entire way that elections were organized

1491
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:06,160
in the united states where

1492
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,160
uh you you pushed you made it a

1493
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:09,680
massively distributed

1494
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,640
effort where every county ran their own

1495
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,000
election in their own

1496
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:16,240
particular way while that was a really

1497
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:17,200
great

1498
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,160
uh a way of of organizing elections for

1499
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:21,920
sort of the public choice

1500
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:25,040
uh and um and other challenges

1501
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,680
of of the you know first 200 years of

1502
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:29,440
the country's uh history

1503
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,920
um you know recently that that put all

1504
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:32,559
of those

1505
00:49:32,559 --> 00:49:35,920
officials um very much at risk for

1506
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,359
sophisticated nation state tampering uh

1507
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:41,599
as they went forward and so you know we

1508
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:43,760
resolved that we had to do something

1509
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,040
about that and so we launched the

1510
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:47,599
athenian project with a simple premise

1511
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:49,440
which was how can we provide our

1512
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,520
services at no cost

1513
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,319
to any u.s election official that is

1514
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,440
charged with

1515
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:57,280
administering elections in any way and

1516
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:58,880
we can't protect everything you know

1517
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,400
we're not in the voting booth and if

1518
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:02,079
there's corrupt software on

1519
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:04,079
on a voting machine um that's not

1520
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:05,920
something that that we're in a position

1521
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,119
to be able to

1522
00:50:07,119 --> 00:50:09,599
uh to protect but we can help make sure

1523
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:11,440
that you know people can register to

1524
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:12,640
vote uh through

1525
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:14,880
you know a website reliably and

1526
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,319
consistently they can find out where

1527
00:50:16,319 --> 00:50:17,839
their polling place is

1528
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,200
um the the districts can report back the

1529
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,000
results

1530
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,160
uh through a secure mechanism they can

1531
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,079
then uh the the associated press

1532
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,520
or whoever can actually publish those

1533
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,440
results out and so the internet is

1534
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:33,119
is critically um intertwined today with

1535
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:35,599
safe and and fair elections and when we

1536
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:36,319
launched that

1537
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:39,200
um shortly after the 2016 election i i

1538
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,000
don't think we knew

1539
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,559
exactly uh what the what the uptake

1540
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,040
would be

1541
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,319
and you know again i i think that

1542
00:50:46,319 --> 00:50:48,240
you know we there there are people in

1543
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,760
there are people on our team who are

1544
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:51,119
democrats or people on our team who are

1545
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,240
republicans

1546
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,720
and and we we worked incredibly hard to

1547
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:55,520
say you know

1548
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,359
we don't care if you're a red state or a

1549
00:50:57,359 --> 00:50:59,040
blue state or a purple state

1550
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:00,400
we just want to make sure that you've

1551
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:02,400
got the tools and technology

1552
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,240
to uh to keep to keep the institutions

1553
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,240
uh that that are critical to government

1554
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,240
online and and secure and i

1555
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:12,079
i'm really proud of the fact that you

1556
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:13,520
know while there were there were

1557
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:14,800
there were a lot of things about the

1558
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,960
2020 election that were

1559
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:20,079
um that were that were very

1560
00:51:20,079 --> 00:51:23,599
uh uh contentious um across across the

1561
00:51:23,599 --> 00:51:24,319
country

1562
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:26,319
um cyber attacks did not play a

1563
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:27,760
significant role in them

1564
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,920
and and and and i think that that was

1565
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,839
because of hard work from cloudflare

1566
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,000
but also organizations like microsoft

1567
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,680
and google who are providing their

1568
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,040
services at no cost

1569
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,440
um to governments around the world and

1570
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:40,319
uh

1571
00:51:40,319 --> 00:51:43,280
and that was a real change from the 2016

1572
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:43,599
uh

1573
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:45,520
elections and and i think it's i think

1574
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:47,359
that that was incredibly rewarding

1575
00:51:47,359 --> 00:51:49,680
uh for for our entire team the thing

1576
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,480
that's that's

1577
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:51,920
that's interesting about it is you know

1578
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,079
if if you if you're

1579
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,520
you know i think a lot of the people who

1580
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,200
are in this audience

1581
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,960
um would would see that as

1582
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,160
you know of course businesses should be

1583
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,240
doing that um but but businesses

1584
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,520
sometimes you know the business leaders

1585
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,359
sometimes have a hard time justifying it

1586
00:52:07,359 --> 00:52:08,559
because they have to

1587
00:52:08,559 --> 00:52:10,720
you know it's it's time that their

1588
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,079
engineers are spent building

1589
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:13,680
building features that could otherwise

1590
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,160
be spent um you know for features for

1591
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,839
you know big customers who pay you you

1592
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:19,680
know lots of money or or

1593
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:22,800
time that um you know the distraction to

1594
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:23,119
the

1595
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:25,599
the rest of what you're doing um but i

1596
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:26,720
think for anyone who

1597
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:29,599
is um you know a business leader i will

1598
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,319
say that

1599
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:32,160
like there has been nothing which has

1600
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:33,680
been better

1601
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,839
at helping us recruit some of the best

1602
00:52:35,839 --> 00:52:37,280
engineers in the world

1603
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:40,000
at helping us recruit customers uh to

1604
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,599
sign up for our service

1605
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,720
than um doing what is right

1606
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:46,880
on on a societal basis and spending the

1607
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:48,960
time to to work on these

1608
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:50,960
you know public-private partnerships uh

1609
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,119
partnerships with civil society

1610
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,920
and and you know we do those things

1611
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,280
because we think of the right thing to

1612
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:58,319
do

1613
00:52:58,319 --> 00:53:00,240
but it also turns out that those those

1614
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:01,520
are the the right thing to do

1615
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,440
to attract the best engineers in the

1616
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:06,400
world um you know sign up more customers

1617
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,839
uh and and so you can you can do

1618
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:12,559
you can do the right thing uh and also

1619
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:12,960
have a

1620
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,400
have a it'd be the right thing for your

1621
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:15,920
business as well and i think we we

1622
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:16,960
learned that lesson

1623
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,520
over and over again and uh and it's part

1624
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,520
of why it's it's easy for us to continue

1625
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:24,800
to invest in these in these areas

1626
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,839
um so we have a few questions from the

1627
00:53:27,839 --> 00:53:28,640
audience

1628
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:31,599
one is saying that last year you joined

1629
00:53:31,599 --> 00:53:33,280
gni and committed to working towards the

1630
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,359
u.n principles on business and human

1631
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:35,920
rights

1632
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,839
can you speak to how this has impacted

1633
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,440
the company internally

1634
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,599
and what are you doing differently now

1635
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:42,720
after you've uh

1636
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:46,160
signed up to this uh to this to this

1637
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,960
work so you know one of the things

1638
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,520
that's um

1639
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,800
you know i think that we have done i

1640
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:57,599
think we are making significant progress

1641
00:53:57,599 --> 00:54:01,040
in fixing what i think of as the kind of

1642
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:02,559
core bugs

1643
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,640
of the internet and some of those bugs

1644
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:05,760
are that

1645
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:09,119
someone who is sitting on a line uh

1646
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:10,319
between you and whoever you're

1647
00:54:10,319 --> 00:54:12,720
communicating with i

1648
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:15,200
can the way the internet was designed

1649
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,640
see everything you're you're doing

1650
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:17,760
see everything you're saying see

1651
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,119
everything you're communicating and so

1652
00:54:19,119 --> 00:54:20,960
starting back in 2014

1653
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:23,200
when we made encryption free for you

1654
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,640
know all of our customers and that

1655
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:25,119
really

1656
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:27,200
was that and then the work from let's

1657
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,280
encrypt and mozilla and eff

1658
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:31,680
you know that that those things really

1659
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:33,119
turn the tide from

1660
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,040
something where encryption was only

1661
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:36,319
available to those people who could

1662
00:54:36,319 --> 00:54:37,680
afford to pay for it

1663
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,680
too it was available by default across

1664
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,599
platforms was a big deal

1665
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,960
we've worked with 1.1.1.1 our our dns

1666
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:47,520
resolver to encrypt dns traffic

1667
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,960
and you know push much more of of dns to

1668
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,359
be

1669
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:53,680
to be encrypted today uh we're working

1670
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,440
on encrypting the sni which is sort of

1671
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:56,079
the

1672
00:54:56,079 --> 00:54:58,240
um the information on the outside of the

1673
00:54:58,240 --> 00:55:00,480
uh of the envelope we're working to

1674
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,119
um to actually encrypt the underlying uh

1675
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:04,000
connectivity

1676
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:07,280
of how routers uh connect together and

1677
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:10,319
and as a result of that

1678
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:13,760
it is it is is creating is making it

1679
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:16,079
much harder for governments

1680
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,280
to be able to restrict uh

1681
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,079
what content flows flows across across

1682
00:55:22,079 --> 00:55:22,720
the internet

1683
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,319
um and and we're sort of closing down

1684
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:28,960
all of all of those those um those

1685
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:30,880
different those different paths

1686
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,040
um that said there are governments that

1687
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,240
have laws

1688
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,599
uh and and those laws uh in in many

1689
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:38,079
times

1690
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:39,920
you know are actually fairly reasonable

1691
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,599
and and well thought out i mean it's

1692
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:42,799
it's hard

1693
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:46,400
to um you know again as the american

1694
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:49,599
uh going going into germany and and

1695
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:51,119
you know the german german government

1696
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:52,640
says you should shut down

1697
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,960
uh neo-nazi content and and you know as

1698
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,960
a naive american you might say

1699
00:55:56,960 --> 00:55:58,720
well what about the first amendment and

1700
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:00,079
and i think uh you know

1701
00:56:00,079 --> 00:56:02,000
if if they don't roll your eyes at you

1702
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,760
um you know a reasonable

1703
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,760
um german regulator will say well i

1704
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,200
understand that that is

1705
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,040
your law born out of your tradition and

1706
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:12,240
your history but

1707
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:14,880
we have very different sets of laws uh

1708
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,799
born out of a very different

1709
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:18,480
tradition in a very different history

1710
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:20,240
and i think you have to respect that

1711
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,119
and um and and i think that it's

1712
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,400
important that governments

1713
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,760
be transparent uh and consistent and

1714
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,799
accountable

1715
00:56:28,799 --> 00:56:30,240
to the rules that they have in place but

1716
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,839
i think you need to um

1717
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:33,200
that you need to respect that on the

1718
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:36,319
other hand there are times where

1719
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,480
governments go way too far and they and

1720
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,480
they infringe on

1721
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,400
what are really the civil rights of

1722
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,920
organizations around the world and

1723
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,839
so the consequence as we um

1724
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:50,640
are able to encrypt more of the traffic

1725
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,880
online as we're able to

1726
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:54,160
shut down a lot of the ways that

1727
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,920
governments traditionally regulate the

1728
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:56,880
internet

1729
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,960
more and more of those questions come to

1730
00:56:58,960 --> 00:56:59,920
us uh

1731
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,400
and and we have to um deal with them and

1732
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:03,760
again we operate

1733
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,040
in all of these countries around the

1734
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,880
world and um

1735
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,720
and so we have to respect the laws in

1736
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,160
those countries around the world

1737
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,079
but there are times where governments go

1738
00:57:12,079 --> 00:57:13,280
too far and you need to

1739
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,200
set a real floor and so i think that

1740
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:16,400
that's why

1741
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,340
gni and the un are such an important

1742
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:21,520
[Applause]

1743
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,880
principles for companies to sign up to

1744
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:27,040
to be able to push back when governments

1745
00:57:27,040 --> 00:57:28,319
do go too far

1746
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:30,079
and say you know this is the floor below

1747
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:32,319
which we we will not cross

1748
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:35,520
and so i i keep a copy of that um

1749
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:38,400
of of that document on my desk and i

1750
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,480
think it's a constant reminder for us

1751
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:43,440
that um that we do have obligations and

1752
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:45,200
and that we have to make sure that

1753
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,200
that we're not falling below what what

1754
00:57:47,200 --> 00:57:49,200
are the basic human rights standards

1755
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:52,000
uh that that are online even as as we

1756
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,280
increasingly have to work with

1757
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,520
governments around the world

1758
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:57,599
thank you and i think we have time maybe

1759
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,680
for one last question

1760
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,960
and i wanted because we've been talking

1761
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,880
about what governments are doing how

1762
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:04,400
you're working with governments what

1763
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,559
private sector companies are doing but

1764
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,000
what we haven't talked about

1765
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,280
is uh like an entire world that is

1766
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,520
taking place at the un level with like

1767
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:15,040
two processes

1768
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,960
bringing states together trying to agree

1769
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:18,400
on how they should behave with each

1770
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,680
other in cyberspace

1771
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:21,440
so he had two processes that concluded

1772
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,119
their work in the last few months

1773
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:25,520
and they managed to agree on what you

1774
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:26,799
know on the rules of the road as they

1775
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:27,680
call them

1776
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,079
given that some of the biggest attacks

1777
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,920
have states behind them what do you

1778
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,720
think

1779
00:58:32,720 --> 00:58:35,040
the impact of these agreements will be

1780
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,680
in in real life

1781
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,440
you know i know it's it's um it's

1782
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,000
fashionable to sort of

1783
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,599
pooh-pooh these agreements and say they

1784
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:45,040
don't matter

1785
00:58:45,040 --> 00:58:47,359
but what's been fascinating now has been

1786
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:48,559
watching

1787
00:58:48,559 --> 00:58:51,760
as there have been you know bilateral

1788
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:54,319
or multilateral agreements uh between

1789
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:55,200
governments

1790
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,559
that they actually do then impact uh

1791
00:58:58,559 --> 00:59:02,480
how how cyber attackers

1792
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,280
operate online when the obama

1793
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:06,319
administration

1794
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:09,119
and and the g administration signed a

1795
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:10,559
cyber accord

1796
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,400
uh we actually saw a dramatic decrease

1797
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:17,359
in cyber attacks coming out of china

1798
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,160
even from

1799
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,319
uh from private organizations and

1800
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:21,520
individuals

1801
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:24,559
targeting uh us-based companies um

1802
00:59:24,559 --> 00:59:27,040
and so and and and and then you know the

1803
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,079
latest example

1804
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:30,720
um which is which is which is a maybe a

1805
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,240
less positive one is

1806
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:34,880
that you know you see a lot of the um

1807
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,200
cyber attacks coming out of russia

1808
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,359
specifically coding into their their

1809
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:40,400
malware

1810
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,559
uh restrictions that make sure that they

1811
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:43,760
don't touch

1812
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:46,799
or target any russian speaking

1813
00:59:46,799 --> 00:59:49,440
individuals or companies and so i think

1814
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,040
it's important that governments work on

1815
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,119
this i think it's it's important that

1816
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:55,119
that these principles get outlined but

1817
00:59:55,119 --> 00:59:57,040
again i would caution this audience

1818
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:59,119
to make sure that you continue to watch

1819
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:00,720
this because it will be very tempting

1820
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:01,760
for governments

1821
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,640
to slip in additional censorship and

1822
01:00:04,640 --> 01:00:06,240
content regulation

1823
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:09,200
in the in the form of cyber regulation

1824
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,400
and i think it's important that we all

1825
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:11,200
watch for that

1826
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,359
and and and try and defend the best of

1827
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:14,319
the internet to the best of our

1828
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:16,240
abilities

1829
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,640
matthew prince uh thank you very much

1830
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,400
for your time today and for this great

1831
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,559
conversation and thank you very much for

1832
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,319
the audience and for all the interesting

1833
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:26,319
questions and all the luck with the rest

1834
01:00:26,319 --> 01:00:27,520
of guys gone

1835
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,839
thank you

1836
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,759
you
