15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,960
is to present a comprehensive data set

on the requests

17
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,160
and status of requests made by

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,600
government agencies for user information

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,520
this is one of the actions we take to

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,960
strengthen transparency

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,040
in ensuring the digital security of our

22
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,320
users

23
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,719
since 2012 we have been publishing the

24
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:48,239
transparency report

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,120

statistical data

27
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,239

we report the number of requests made by

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
the korean government regarding user

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:02,800

32
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,799
and the status of cases and accounts

33
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,640
duly processed

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,159
the type of information that the

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,760
government may request for

36
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,799
are as follows communication data

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,040

40
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,360
does not process

41
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,680
requests for individual user information

42
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,119
by government agencies

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,080
without respecting official procedures

44
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,840
we make great efforts to increase

45
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,840
people's access to information

46
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,600
by improving the readability of our

47
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,200
content we present

48
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,920
clear explanations on the terms

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:38,880
standards

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,640
and procedures relevant to the

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,720
disclosure of user information

52
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,840
in simple language on our website the

53
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,280
transparency report

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,680
is a part of cacao's efforts to fulfill

55
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,920
our digital responsibility

56
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,640
first of all it is significant in terms

57
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,119
of the protection of user rights

58
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,079
it allows us to transparently report and

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:01,200
release data

60
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,719
on how we are handling government

61
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,600
requests for user information

62
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,878
secondly as cacao observes due processes

63
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,520
on requests by government agencies we

64
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,760
believe that it is our responsibility

65
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,319
entrusted to us by users to disclose

66
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,280
such data

67
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,120
in the transparency report so that

68
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,200
everyone may view it

69
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,160
lastly kakao's transparency report not

70
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,160
only encompasses our endeavor to ensure

71
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,200
user rights

72
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,440
but it also expresses our pride in

73
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
keeping our users information

74
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,040
strictly guarded according to legal

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,560
procedures

76
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,040
in such a dynamic and unstable digital

77
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:37,840
environment

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,680
we make every effort to protect our

79
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,519
users rights and to fulfill our

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,400
corporate responsibilities and promises

81
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
committed to the promises we have made

82
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
cacao strives to provide

83
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
open and resourceful information for our

84
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,840
