RightsCon 2021, 10th Anniversary

9
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,360
(Brett Solomon) The fact that we're actually

10
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,360
at the tenth anniversary of RightsCon is

11
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,520
deeply surprising.

12
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,160
(Mohamad Najem) When I think about RightsCon

13
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,040
I always go back to the first one.

14
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,506
It was the beginning of 

15
00:00:23,506 --> 00:00:24,720
the movement.

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,080
(Nnenna Nwakanma) When I have a battle,

17
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:27,919
a digital rights battle to fight,

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,000
I go bring out my

19
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,103
RightsCon San Francisco hoodie.

20
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,836
Yeah, 

21
00:00:31,836 --> 00:00:33,199
the spirit is with me.

22
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,040
(Nicole Karlebach) There are few other forums

23
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,760
where there's such a

24
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,120
diverse audience

25
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,120
for these issues.

26
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:40,880
(Marianne Díaz Hernández) RightsCon is my favorite 

27
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:42,080
conference of the year. 

28
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,320
Where I can go

29
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,814
and refill the well 

30
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:46,360
of ideas.

31
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:47,160
(Mutale Nkonde) It was like an

32
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,879
online candy store.

33
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,400
Everyone that I had ever wanted to talk to

34
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,440
was talking at the same time.

35
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,960
(Brett Solomon) The original concept

36
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,880
was how do we bring

37
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,280
human rights agenda

38
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,480
to the tech sector.

39
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:00,720
We're still dealing

40
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,240
with the asymmetry

41
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:05,360
between the tech sector and the citizen.

42
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,360
(Jillian York) And so the challenge is

43
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:07,360
to come up with solutions 

44
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,400
that actually get at these companies

45
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,560
while also not compromising our rights. 

46
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,400
(Marianne Díaz Hernández) Governments have

47
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,560
gotten better at censoring

48
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,360
and filtering speech and content.

49
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,800
(Rebecca MacKinnon) Our continued ability 

50
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,039
to enjoy and exercise human rights

51
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,480
is not guaranteed.

52
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Everybody whose work touches 

53
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,160
on anything related to human rights

54
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,360
is of course having to deal with digital rights.

55
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,600
(upbeat music)

56
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,839
(Mohamad Najem) We really feel the duty on my generation

57
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,360
to actually keep fighting this fight,

58
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,080
to protect the the digital space.

59
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,560
(Nnenna Nwakanma) Have we won some battles?

60
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,119
Yes.

61
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,039
Have we won the war?

62
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:41,679
No.

63
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,280
Will I still fight tomorrow?

64
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,200
Definitely.

65
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,800
(Mutale Nkonde) The RightsCon community is

66
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,920
really busy with the work of

67
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,080
changing the world.

68
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,000
It's really busy with the work of

69
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,280
changing each other.

70
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,000
(Brett Solomon) The power of RightsCon

71
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,399
it's in the conglomeration

72
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,400
and in the convergence of all of these people.

73
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,200
That's the magic of RightsCon.

74
