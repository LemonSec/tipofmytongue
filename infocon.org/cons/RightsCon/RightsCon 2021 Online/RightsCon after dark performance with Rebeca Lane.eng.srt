you today here at rights com 2021 I want to

5
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:17,390
start by sharing this song

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,359
called cat this is a song that was

7
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:22,880
inspired by community feminists

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,679
in the network of  Territorial community feminists

9
00:00:24,679 --> 00:00:27,109
here in Guatemala and that

10
00:00:27,109 --> 00:00:28,970
talks a lot about the work that

11
00:00:28,970 --> 00:00:31,729
indigenous women are doing both

12
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:34,640
in the defense of the territory and in the

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:38,649
defense of women's bodies

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:48,980
[Music]

15
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,710
but we want to be a feminist with

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,380
monetary

17

[Music]

18
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:57,809
is a transgression  because it breaks the

19
00:00:57,809 --> 00:01:01,440
prototype of an intimate traditional woman and

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,960
makes you also bring elements of

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:06,540
deep analysis of life with the

22
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,780
vital energy of the ancestors of the

23
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,780
women who walk with women, the

24
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,170
winners who use their powers of those

25
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,350
who weave with their energy of tem  which he

26
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:22,380
summons in freedom with his word those

27
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,050
that summon the defense of the bodies

28
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:27,660
those that unify the energy of  abya yala

who walk between valleys and mountains those

31
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:38,759
who listen to the spirit of the river those who

32
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,000
are born with the sun every morning and are still

this next song that I want to

60
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:53,800
share with you is a love song a

61
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,050
love song that  I wrote to the

62
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,600
territory where I was born in Guatemala

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:02,380
and it is not a song because I am a

64
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:04,150
nationalist because I am not at all

65
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,400
rather I think it is a song of

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,370
heartbreak because it speaks of everything I love

67
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,709
about this territory,

68
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,810
everything I value but also

69
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,910
Everything that happens here hurts me a lot, all

70
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:18,760
the violence, all the corruption, all the

71
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,890
mismanagement of the country that is making

72
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,080
all the inheritance, the war and the

73
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,140
violence that we currently live, so

74
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,020
it is a song of heartbreak that is

75
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,669
inspired by several poems that  They have been

76
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:33,970
written here in Guatemala about this

77
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,560
I would like to forget your name I would like

78
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:37,480
not to have been born here I would like not to be from

79
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:39,460
here but I cannot forget you and here he

80
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:41,650
continued fighting and from wherever he is

81
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:44,470
because also  From Guatemala there has been a

82
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:46,840
lot of population that has left that has

83
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,820
migrated precisely because of the conditions

84
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,950
we live in and all the people who have

85
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:52,450
migrated and all the people who are

86
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:52,930
far away

87
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:54,490
in some way always carry this

88
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:56,740
little piece of land in their hearts and in their

89
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:58,710

cry that does not come out because I cannot

170

rivers grow but I also speak a little

171
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:28,420
about how unfair it is that precisely in

172
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,860
our territories, which are territories

173
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,070
with so much water

174
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,020
and most of the population does not

175
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,910
have access to water or  that the water is

176
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,610
contaminated or is being used to

177
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:41,280
divert it to the farms for agrochemicals

178
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,200
etc. there is a lot of injustice in the

179
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,450
distribution of water despite the fact that water

180
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:50,280
is a natural good for everyone and

181
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,600
that we are not taking care of it and that we are not

182
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,080
protecting but beyond  Of the

183
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,740
individual responsibilities that

184
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,110
we may have, there are

185
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:00,090
structural issues that make access to

186
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:02,160
water in our territories more

187
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,580
for companies than for people and in

188
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,740

00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,940
a little in this same tune is this

338
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,820
song is called not one less this

339
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:46,400
song is much longer than the

340
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,830
song this song I think it is from

341
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:52,910
2015 it is 6 years old  And it responds to one of

342
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,060
the movements that was born in Argentina and

343
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:59,330
that later in all the other countries of

344
00:18:59,330 --> 00:19:02,570
Abya Yala we adopt the motto of not one

345
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:04,640
less because it is talking about

346
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,090
this reality that we are living of

347
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:11,750
femicides of terrible violence in

348
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:14,990
which we do not obtain justice  not one less

349
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,550
because we want all women

350
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,680
and all girls to live a full

351
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,010
life a full life that can fulfill all

352
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:23,900
their projects of vi  It gives us that we can be

353
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:26,000
happy that we can choose what we

354
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,970
want and when we want it and that

355
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,070
no one anyone feels with the right to

356
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,900
take away the most precious thing we have,

357
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,540
which is life, so this

358
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,029
song called not one less is

359
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:40,849
also dedicated to  All the movements

360
00:19:40,849 --> 00:19:43,669
of struggle and transformation in your abya

361
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:45,700
yala

362
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,400
I arrived safely I

363
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,400


364
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,760
would like to have sweet things to write

365
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,040
but I have to decide and I decide

366
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:09,380
for anger five women today have been

367
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,540
murdered and now at least

368
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,360
twenty women have been raped this is only

369
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,730
one  day in Guatemala multiplies you will know

370
00:20:16,730 --> 00:20:19,340
because we are angry I will not walk

371
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:21,050
with tweezers for those who do not understand that

372
00:20:21,050 --> 00:20:22,850
this is an emergency and we are

373
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:23,900
prepared

374
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,420
I am not a pacifist do not demand things that

375
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,400
you lent us I did not ask for a pedestal and I

376
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,710
deserve it I am like the other highs of

377
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:32,810
walk with aggressive fear because it is the

378
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:34,730
way I defend myself I

379
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,830
do not have privileges to protect this

380
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:38,690
body on the street they think I am a

381
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:41,360
perfect white but I am black with  mo my

382
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,520
flag and brave in the name of me and in that

383
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:46,990
of all my grandmothers

384
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,200
the healer who died from so many blows

385
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,179
because the man who loved her

386
00:20:52,179 --> 00:20:55,030
really hated her the other who was abandoned with

387
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:57,130
a son and when she got sick he had to

388
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,650
send her a hole this goes  for me

389
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,080
because when I was 15 years old

390
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,690
a blow from his hand pierced my face because no

391
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:06,850
human was present the day a

392
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:09,039
criminal left my nipple marked

393
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,220
this goes for the 9-year-old girl forced to

394
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,470
get pregnant because her brother raped her

395
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,960
one  girl without rights because the clergy

396
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,789
consider that abortion is worse than what

397
00:21:18,789 --> 00:21:21,340
they have done to her I refer to the facts

398
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,010
I am not going to explain with drawings to

399
00:21:24,010 --> 00:21:26,440
any of those who believe that with their

400
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,659
intellectuality they are going to come to educate us

401
00:21:28,659 --> 00:21:30,460
sitting in their privileges

402
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,830
I do not have privileges to protect this

403
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,659
body on the street they believe that I am a

404
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,390
perfect white but I am black like my

405
00:21:37,390 --> 00:21:39,549
flag and brave in my name and in that

406
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,990
of all my grandmothers,

407
00:21:43,509 --> 00:21:46,219
counting well in the streets we are giles

408
00:21:46,219 --> 00:21:48,349
des  From Mexico to Chile and the

409
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:51,049
whole planet fighting because alive

410
00:21:51,049 --> 00:21:53,359
we want you, we are not afraid, we want it,

411
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:56,210
tell me, crazy inter-ita, already

412
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:58,159
exaggerated, but the song in my name and

413
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:00,889
that of all my sisters, do not accuse us

414
00:22:00,889 --> 00:22:03,349
of being violent.  It is self-defense we are

415
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:05,960
in resistance we are no longer defenseless

416
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,619
no but I am black like my flag and

417
00:22:12,619 --> 00:22:14,719
brave in my name and in all

418
00:22:14,719 --> 00:22:17,889
my tracks you fly

419
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,020
this next song that I want to

420
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:32,890
share with you, it was also born in 2015 in

421
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:36,240
the context of Guatemala and several

422
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,910
citizen struggles that  They were held

423
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:41,410
particularly in the urban areas of the

424
00:22:41,410 --> 00:22:45,280
country where the main engine of the

425
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,930
struggle at that time was the fight

426
00:22:46,930 --> 00:22:49,780
against corruption and they were

427
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,880
very large, very powerful mobilizations.

428
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:53,470


429
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:56,110


430
00:22:56,110 --> 00:23:00,110
To date, they continue

431
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:02,540
with criminal proceedings for the

432
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:05,929
corruption cases that they had, however what

433
00:23:05,929 --> 00:23:08,270
happened to us in the city is that by not

434
00:23:08,270 --> 00:23:10,400
having that  organizational experience that,

435
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,380
for example, has other movements here

436
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:14,330
in this territory such as the

437
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:15,950
peasant movement, the indigenous

438
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,980
movement, the union movement, and

439
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,929
the struggle even broke up very quickly and we

440
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:23,690
were left with only we want this,

441
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:27,350
we give it to them, well, I'm going to my house.

442
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:29,420
We do not mobilize and it is a song

443
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:33,410
that is born a bit out of anger that we do not

444
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,450
have that capacity to organize

445
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,580
and fight and that it can help us to

446
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,110
transcend what we are doing,

447
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,020
we see it now, for example, as it happens in

448
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,150
Colombia that they have already been in for more than  One month

449
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,730
unemployed we see what has happened in Chile that

450
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,559
after months and months of struggle

451
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:52,340
has at least come to think about

452
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,480
reforming the constituent, so I

453
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,549
think a bit of anger although

454
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,470
I also understand and understand, for example,

455
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:01,970
that  Especially those of us from

456
00:24:01,970 --> 00:24:05,470
Central America who are connected here

457
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:07,510
know that here too the history of

458
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:09,610
war has weighed heavily on us and

459
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:13,030
left us very serious consequences.  rt

460
00:24:13,030 --> 00:24:13,900
which also makes political organization

461
00:24:13,900 --> 00:24:16,090
much more difficult and

462
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,559
complicated due to fear but also

463
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:21,970
because the repressive apparatuses that

464
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,650
were used during the war

465
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,600
were never dismantled, they are

466
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,340
still part of the state and they continue to be

467
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,020
used as a form of repression

468
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,789
as we are.  also seeing in the

469
00:24:30,789 --> 00:24:32,770
case of Colombia that all those

470
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,230
forces that have been used against

471
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:37,390
the people themselves in these times of

472
00:24:37,390 --> 00:24:39,789
supposed democracy continue to work

473
00:24:39,789 --> 00:24:42,580
to guarantee order for them,

474
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,620
so this song called queen of

475
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:46,740

people without memory who take

the order that remains is convenient,

song  What I want to share with you is

called neither in closed nor with fear and it is

565
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:18,460
a song that was born in Honduras but

566
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:20,500
I think it speaks of three important things

00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:22,930
that organized women and

in this territory, first we no longer

570
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:29,410
want more violence in the  streets we

571
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:31,270
do not want more compliments we do not want to be

572
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:33,100
touched we do not want to be told things

573
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:34,600
we do not want to be afraid of being

574
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:37,000
kidnapped we do not want to be afraid

575
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,490
of  l public space, but we do not want to

00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,230
feel fear in our own homes,

577
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,240
most of the women who are victims

networks in  platforms, etc., well, this

668
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,060
meeting itself is a possibility that

669
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:04,580
the platforms have given us, but also

670
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:06,860
the people who are

671
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,899
human rights defenders, who are defenders

672
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,340
of women's rights,

673
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,350
have also found

674
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:14,929
spaces of violence in these platform spaces and

675
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,690
many times we receive messages  of hatred

676
00:34:17,690 --> 00:34:20,750
for who we are because of how we see ourselves because

677
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,570
of who we love because of our

678
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:27,020
gender identity etc. etc. so this

679
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,969
song I made it because tired of

680
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:31,399
all the hate messages I received

681
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:34,550
I used to get very bad I'm talking about

682
00:34:34,550 --> 00:34:36,649
those that talk about you  appearance and things

683
00:34:36,649 --> 00:34:39,590
like that no longer of more direct threats but

684
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:41,870
These messages that instead of refuting

685
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:43,129
your ideas are

686
00:34:43,129 --> 00:34:45,049
mainly for women to debate your

687
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:47,509
physique, how you look, not because it is a

688
00:34:47,509 --> 00:34:49,219
social learning that we have had to

689
00:34:49,219 --> 00:34:50,839
want to be beautiful, precious and

690
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:52,879
love everyone so I made this

691
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,460
song because  I never want more than

692
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,859
the attack of a person who does

693
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:00,079
not care about the comment of a person

694
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,930
who does not feel the least esteem for me or

695
00:35:02,930 --> 00:35:05,180
is interested in what I do or my work I

696
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:06,529
will not allow that comment to be

697
00:35:06,529 --> 00:35:08,480
mean in my day  I will not allow that

698
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,759
comment to affect my self-esteem and I

699
00:35:10,759 --> 00:35:11,920
wrote this song that is called

700
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,509
always alive so that we are always

701
00:35:14,509 --> 00:35:17,980
alive as a red Malaysian

702
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:29,250
there is also for him to move well he said

703
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:32,310
it was easy to be a woman since

704
00:35:32,310 --> 00:35:35,370
I was little they made me believe that I was pretty and yes

705
00:35:35,370 --> 00:35:38,220
I was not then and no one was going to love me

706
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:41,100
if I was round it was so I would

707
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,370
talk a lot it was if I was not praying I

708
00:35:44,370 --> 00:35:47,100
was fishing and the Virgin Mary told

709
00:35:47,100 --> 00:35:50,040
me that when they grew up I was going to

710
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,500
get married and that  I will take great care of my virginity

711
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:55,590
that instead of smoking and drinking I would learn

712
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:57,810
the winter at home and also cook

713
00:35:57,810 --> 00:36:00,420
nothing stood out doing it and piercing

714

no dancing and teaching how to be happy

has left us that they are building

774

alternatives to what we have

775
00:39:33,170 --> 00:39:36,230
learned is democracy and it is a call

776

then  that all peoples

777
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:40,190
rise up and that we remember that these

778
00:39:40,190 --> 00:39:42,470
struggles also come from our

782
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,170
