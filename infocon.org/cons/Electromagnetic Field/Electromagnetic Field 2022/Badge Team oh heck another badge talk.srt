00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,640
[applause]

2
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,960
Hello. This is a format we came up 
with years and years ago, where the  

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,240
badge team lead stands at the front 
and talks, and the rest of the team  

4
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,400
sit at the back and heckle. I used to 
be one of those people and i regret it.

5
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,211
> I don't think they want 
to hear what the format is 

6
00:00:27,211 --> 00:00:31,357
No?
> Just get on with it

7
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:32,583
[laughter]

8
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:39,280
First off, I've got to thank our sponsors - 
they have done such amazing work. Espressif  

9
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:45,040
have given us parts that didn't exist 
when - what was it three months ago?  

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,440
Three months ago, the chip on 
your badge didn't exist at all  

11
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,239
and we got the first production run of them - it's 
brilliant. PCBgogo have manufactured assembled  

12
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:00,400
10,000 boards for us - that is a heck of 
a lot of boards and they've done it in a  

13
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:06,400
ridiculously short timeframe and fixed many, 
many problems which we'll go over in this talk.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,160
> Many of them are entirely our fault

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,120
So, quite a long time ago now, we were developing 
a badge for EMF 2020. It was quite cool.  

16
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,920
We we got to the prototype stage, we had 
lots of pictures, little bits of art,  

17
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
stuff like that. We had it all planned. 
It was great, everything was going well.  

18
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:37,280
And then there was an apocalypse. Everything was 
terrible, EMF was cancelled. So we decided to  

19
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,840
take a positive spin on it. It's great, we've 
got two entire years where we don't have to  

20
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,720
do anything because we've already 
designed a badge for the next EMF.  

21
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,467
> Oh no you haven't!

22
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:57,120
And then the apocalypse continued. It 
became 2021, and all the silicon in the  

23
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,840
entire universe vanished. This is one of the 
chips we were planning on using - it costs  

24
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,519
$104 now - that would blow out our budget 
quite a bit and Jonty would get sad with us,  

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,760
and we don't want to make Jonty sad. So yeah, 
it doesn't exist, so we kind of panicked a bit  

26
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,400
and we had a bit of a brainstorming session. 
We came up with some fantastic badge ideas.  

27
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,640
I think one of my favourite ones - the musical 
soldering iron was a good idea. It's both an  

28
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:38,559
MP3 player and a soldering iron. The quadcopter was 
quite good, and the thermal sensing monocle badge  

29
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:42,880
just because it means we get to use round LCDs 
and i'm slightly obsessed with round LCDs.

30
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,320
So yeah, we went through all of these and 
we carry on with brainstorming. We decided  

31
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:53,359
to go with the one that was between the 
de-auther, particularly to troll the NOC,  

32
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,519
and the high voltage badge, which 
would probably kill everyone.  

33
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:03,840
Apparently we're not allowed to do that 
either - First Aid get annoyed at us.

34
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,560
So yeah, we designed a new badge. 
We went with a microcontroller  

35
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,560
that didn't exist yet, and 
Espressif would guarantee  

36
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:18,240
that we could get them before the event. Quite 
close to the event, but still before the event.

37
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,280
> Technically

38
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:27,839
Sort of mostly before the event. It's a fast 
schedule, we think we can do it. It's fine,  

39
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:36,560
yeah, let's go. So, we're a few weeks ago now. 
We have prototyping, everything seems to work.  

40
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:39,040
It's starting to look pretty 
we're doing pretty well.

41
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,880
> Yeah it all went perfectly 
well, nothing at all went wrong 

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,160
> yeah, thank you for attending 
the talk yeah you've been wonderful 

43
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,840
> those four months we had 
no stress whatsoever, yeah

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,600
So here's the first disaster. 
We decided to be clever.  

45
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,880
When we started designing we wanted a crypto chip 
on the thing and we found somebody who had 3,500 of  

46
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:06,960
them in stock so we bought them straight away. 
Then, we tried to use them and it turned out  

47
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:13,600
they didn't in any way support any of the crypto 
that we needed. So yeah, if anyone wants to buy  

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,320
3500 A1006 crypto chips, if you email 
badge@emfcamp.org we can sell you them.  

49
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:27,840
Apparently they are now worth more than we paid 
for them so, you know, it will help fund EMF.

50
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,520
So we did a redesign. We managed 
to find a chip that we could buy,  

51
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,200
and we could afford, we couldn't talk to 
it over I²C which is unfortunate because  

52
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,479
ideally if you have a chip on your board 
you want to be able to actually use it.  

53
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:52,800
It's a bit of a pain - we couldn't get any any 
of them. We could get 3,500 of them from China,  

54
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:58,960
we couldn't get one of them - apparently that's 
the thing. We found a dev kit left over from 2014.  

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:05,599
It was incredibly expensive but it had some chips 
in that we thought might be kind of the right one?  

56
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:13,280
They were kind of the right one, we still couldn't 
actually talk to them. That was fun. So yeah  

57
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,680
this is interesting. So, Microchip on their 
crypto chips, they don't label them. As part of  

58
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,320
their "overall security features" the part marking 
for all crypto devices is "intentionally vague".  

59
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,479
"The marking on the top of the package does not 
provide any information as to the actual device  

60
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:33,520
type or the manufacturer of the device." This 
isn't security, this is just silly but you know.  

61
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:40,719
We're not an IC manufacturer, surely it's 
fine. So yeah, have i already said this bit?

62
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,520
> You got the last point

63
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,359
Ah yes, we managed to talk to it in the 
end. We were trying to talk to it at five  

64
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,280
times the speed it wanted us to talk to 
and we just forgot to turn that bit on.

65
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:58,005
> This will be a theme
[laughter]

66
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,560
Oh, I did actually try, when we got these, 
to pull some strings because I have through  

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,320
work some contacts within Microchip. I 
spoke to somebody quite high up in their  

68
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,240
tech support and they they told me when 
i asked them that "as part of Microchip's  

69
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
overall security features the part marking for 
all crypto devices is intentionally vague."  

70
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:27,360
So yeah, it wasn't as useful as i was hoping.

71
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:34,560
Here's some fun. When you try to buy 
three and a half thousand of something,  

72
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,000
your vendors just vanish. This battery 
vendor, every three months for the past  

73
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,680
six years, has sent us an email saying "do 
you want to buy anything? We've got loads of  

74
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,280
batteries, come and buy some batteries, we've got 
batteries, come and buy batteries." You send them  

75
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,080
an email and they're like "batteries, what? 
We don't sell batteries." Or if they just...

76
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:59,450
> If anybody finds these vendors 
please email badge@emfcamp.org

77
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,200
So yeah, we weren't getting any response from 
this battery and this was about a month ago and  

78
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:15,520
it takes about a month to get batteries from China 
to the UK. This was becoming an issue. We sent out  

79
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:25,039
the bat signal at this point and we spoke to other 
European-based conference badge teams and we stole  

80
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:31,760
their supplier who is amazing. They respond 
to all of our emails, they send us loads and  

81
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:37,920
loads of emails, they send me random WhatsApps. 
They once called me. On the phone. It was weird.

82
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:42,720
> They also doubled our battery 
capacity as soon as you asked.

83
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,720
Yeah, so the first battery we got through 
they were going to give us 70 mAh which you know  

84
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,560
we could have done with and slowly, in 
between us paying for the battery and  

85
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,160
them actually shipping them, they managed to keep 
increasing the capacity of them. I'm not sure how  

86
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,880
but we're pretty sure they're 
not lying. Like 95% sure.

87
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
So yeah, we've got the batteries. The batteries 
are on the way. That was happening fantastically.  

88
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,719
The problem was, we didn't have the...everything 
else that goes on the circuit board.  

89
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:19,120
We'd sent quite a lot of money to 
our China sourcing expert who had,  

90
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:24,080
as far as we could tell, just stopped responding 
to our emails after we'd sent him all this money  

91
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:28,320
which isn't what you want after sending 
somebody a heck of a lot of money.

92
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,679
He wasn't getting our emails, we weren't 
getting his, neither of us had realised  

93
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:40,799
that we were both waiting for an email from 
another person that had already been sent  

94
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,440
eventually I was getting to the point of writing 
emails that started "as per my last email"

95
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,954
And then somebody pointed out to me that I could 
in fact phone them.

96
00:08:54,954 --> 00:08:56,160
> Whaaaat?
And that worked straight away.

97
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,800
I know! apparently these things can 
actually be used to make phone calls.

98
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,760
> I hear that we gave out 
phones in a previous year

99
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,260
Yeah

100
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,280
We got in touch and it turned out that our email 
sending solution wasn't. Which is not ideal.  

101
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,719
So yeah, we started production. We had 
all the bits, everything was going well  

102
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:27,600
and then we stopped production because everything 
broke. Wi-Fi was just completely broken. We had  

103
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,360
tested this as part of our initial prototypes 
- we tested it by having a look and seeing if  

104
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:38,640
we could see any Wi-Fi networks. What apparently 
none of us had ever thought to test with it was  

105
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,880
if you could actually connect to a 
Wi-Fi network. Turns out you couldn't.

106
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,319
When we transmit, nothing was happening 
and sometimes it was just resetting, so  

107
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:55,280
we started going a bit silly with this. We were 
adding extra capacitors everywhere, there were  

108
00:09:55,280 --> 00:10:01,040
inductors. This picture down here has a little 
kind of "high rise" of capacitors on it trying  

109
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,560
to trying to figure out what the heck was actually 
going on. Nothing helped, we got our RF wizards in  

110
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,800
they started generating these strange charts - 
i'm pretty sure it's the tea leaves that they're  

111
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,800
actually doing. Even that, nothing was found 
- it just wasn't wasn't working and it should  

112
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,520
have been working. And then we figured out that 
you could take the antenna off and it worked.  

113
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,520
[laughter]

114
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:29,520
Which is sort of the opposite of what 
you normally expect with an RF circuit.  

115
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:38,480
So yeah, that was a bit weird. So yeah, we just 
turned down the power - turn down the volume a bit  

116
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,960
and it turns out it's not talking over itself 
anymore and it now kind of works? You have to  

117
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,960
stand fairly close to a DK as you all will 
have found trying to update your badges.

118
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:57,200
Yeah, it works. Fantastic, we can restart 
production again. Oh wait. No. This is a  

119
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:02,960
USB-C connector. USB-C is brilliant, it's on 
everything nowadays. This is a USB-C connector  

120
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:08,560
with very very wobbly pins and apparently that 
is incredibly difficult to actually manufacture.  

121
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:18,240
So yeah, they came with bent pins. PCBgogo who 
manufactured our boards, they were reworking them  

122
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,440
as they were coming off the line, they did 150 and 
then just asked us to actually try and get them  

123
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:30,960
connectors that would work. So yeah we got our 
component sourcer to start yelling at people, he  

124
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,480
yelled at the right people and they said "oh yeah 
we'll send you over a replacement reel, they'll  

125
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,120
be ready at the beginning of June." Yeah that's 
a bit too late. We asked if we could delay EMF  

126
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
until July but apparently there's another festival 
here at the time so we're not allowed to do that.

127
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,600
We figured out a really cool - well 
PCBgogo figured out a really cool way  

128
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,320
of getting around this. They made a stencil 
that has two different layers in it, to  

129
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:00,800
allow you to add more solder paste 
underneath the USB-C connector  

130
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:09,240
and just kind of...have enough goo there to grab 
the pins? Is that right? That sounds right yeah?

131
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:16,480
> Yeah so they made a stencil that is thicker 
on one end than the other so tower of solder,  

132
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:20,160
tower of goo on there is taller 
and it reaches the bent pins

133
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:20,480
Yes

134
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
> And doesn't short too many of them out

135
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,920
> Right

136
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:28,240
Well it sure, we got one out of all of the 
badges we made that wasn't working after  

137
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:32,880
that which is pretty amazing, considering it 
was all of them that were broken beforehand.  

138
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,360
So yeah, they then gave us two assembly lines 
and, as far as i can tell, literally everybody  

139
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,200
in their factory and made all of our PCBs. 
This was about two weeks ago now so...

140
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:46,000
> It feels like two months

141
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,760
It does. I'm pretty sure I've got quite a 
lot more grey hair than I had when I started.  

142
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,720
So yeah it was done! The boards 
had shipped! Then this happened.

143
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:06,080
> I'd like to personally apologise to 
Wren for annoying them so much with "what  

144
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,560
flight is leaving from Hong Kong airport 
right now? What's going in an hour?"

145
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:19,360
> We did actually track it down to the 
correct flight, so all our estimates were  

146
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,440
exactly correct and we knew exactly what plane 
our packages were on at every point in time

147
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,320
> We can't write software 
but we can track DHL flights.

148
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,080
Handily, it turns out DHL are incredibly 
pessimistic when it comes to getting things  

149
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:36,720
through UK customs, and we actually managed 
to get these a week before they were expected,  

150
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,640
which is good because getting them 
tomorrow would have been non-ideal.

151
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,320
Yeah they arrived! There's like boxes and all 
sorts. This is the badge tent, if you've checked  

152
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,080
into the badge tent it looks a lot messier 
than this right now although i think the  

153
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:55,440
team have been tidying it today while i've 
been panickingly writing this presentation.

154
00:13:56,960 --> 00:14:01,760
They work! Look at that! It's got a 
little thing on it and everything. Woo!

155
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,600
So we started assembling. We got the 
sweatshop going. It was quite warm  

156
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,720
we're not still not sure about 
the kind of "sweatshop" nomenclature  

157
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:16,400
but it was pretty apt on Wednesday last week when 
it was a lot nicer weather than this. So yeah we  

158
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,400
we did some pretty good work between all 
of the volunteers who helped out with the  

159
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,640
sweatshop just kind of flashing things,
assembling things, testing things.  

160
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,629
So yeah, thank you, thank you so much for 
everybody who's volunteered for that. It was 

161
00:14:31,629 --> 00:14:36,131
brilliant. I want to give a round of applause 
to all the people who helped out with that.

162
00:14:36,131 --> 00:14:47,360
[applause]

163
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:53,760
And then we stopped again because it turned out 
that some of the screens weren't working. Quite a  

164
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:59,680
lot of the screens weren't working. I was sat down 
making badges and six in a row didn't work.  

165
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,720
So yeah, we started figuring out that like 
25% of all the badges weren't working,  

166
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:10,000
and we'd bought 23% more badges than we needed.  

167
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,000
One of those numbers is bigger than the 
other one and it's in the bad direction.

168
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:20,480
Our volunteers figured this one out 
entirely on their own, it's brilliant,  

169
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,880
we didn't have to think or anything. Although 
we did quite a lot of thinking and panicking.  

170
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,880
We were kind of running around going "aaaaaaah" 
while everybody else was figuring this one out.  

171
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,200
We started assembling the working batches 
of screens because we were able to split  

172
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,720
off the ones that were working and the ones 
that weren't working, while we debugged the  

173
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:44,080
actual problem. So Matt woke up at 1am with 
an idea of how to fix this. He broke it and  

174
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:49,760
started fiddling around with our initialisation 
code, and he fixed it but unfortunately his  

175
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:55,680
badge was broken in a different way as 
well, so he didn't realise he'd fixed it.

176
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,000
> And then I spent a load of time the next day 
saying "oh, I've already tried that, don't bother"

177
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,978
Yeah

178
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:04,693
> I didn't believe him

179
00:16:04,693 --> 00:16:06,800
> Fair.

180
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,668
I'm glad you didn't believe him.

181
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,760
[applause]

182
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:19,120
So yeah we're up and running again. Woo! Look at 
that. That is a pile of 2000 badges there I think.  

183
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,400
That's a lot of badges. It took a lot of time, 
and there's a lot more still not in that picture.

184
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,880
> If we could have less people come to...fewer 
people come to EMF next year, that would be great,  

185
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,320
[laughter]

186
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,840
> so that we don't have to 
assemble quite so many badges

187
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,120
> And let's not do three 
circuit boards next time as well

188
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,850
Oh we'll go for six next time

189
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,742
[laughter]
No?

190
00:16:46,742 --> 00:16:49,839
> Can I point out I know where you live Bob?

191
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,000
So yeah, we were able to start giving out our 
badges right after the opening talk which is  

192
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,600
entirely unprecedented in EMF history. I 
got to buy myself my own barcode scanner  

193
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,119
because the entrance tent needed all of 
the ones that we normally steal from them.  

194
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:09,439
And i've always wanted to buy a barcode scanner 
so now I have a barcode scanner, it's fantastic.

195
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:16,560
So almost everyone has actually picked up their 
badges by now. We issued 2,000 of them on that  

196
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:25,440
first day and we're now up to 2,370...that's 
wrong - it was 2,380 when I looked. Shocking.

197
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:29,200
> Yeah we tried closing the badge 
tent and people turned up for badges.

198
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:36,400
Ben's not been allowed to leave the badge tent. 
He lives there now. So yes, we're all incredibly  

199
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:44,316
exhausted. Oh. Ooh. This is the end of my bit, 
I get to sit down now, so yeah, thanks everyone!

200
00:17:44,316 --> 00:17:55,678
[applause]

201
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,880
MORAG: I haven't planned this.

202
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:02,480
> It's alright, none of us have planned this.

203
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,560
> Can i have a heckling microphone?

204
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,600
Oh no, you're not supposed to heckle me. Be nice!

205
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,200
What am i pressing?

206
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,840
> Press space

207
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:21,840
Yes, so they asked me to make it 
pretty and I got a bit carried away.

208
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,160
So i was like "ooh it's a lovely wavy shape, we've 
got the sea theme." I was already drawing the  

209
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:38,240
the big tiling graphic that you might 
have seen on the screens and on the  

210
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:43,200
tablecloths and stuff. It's like, oh I'm really 
into the groove of drawing sea creatures now  

211
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,960
but now I have the opportunity 
to make them shiny! So...

212
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:57,520
I was sketching all kinds of things on paper 
and i was like "oh this is this is brilliant  

213
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:06,480
I've never done this before!" And then I was 
having trouble figuring out the scale and then  

214
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:12,080
I got my very own prototype boards to play with 
and I got the paint markers out and I was like  

215
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,080
oh actually I think this is actually how much I
can fit on there. So that was really good fun.  

216
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,840
I'm not sure what's going to happen when I 
press this button, what have we got next?  

217
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:32,399
So you can probably tell, as I say I 
got a bit carried away, Kliment was  

218
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:39,760
absolutely fantastic on working through with me 
on iterations of "oh this is a great idea...but"

219
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,960
> But we can't do that, because it won't work.

220
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes we need we need to squeeze too many 
electrons here, we can't fit the seaweed in.

221
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,448
[laughter]

222
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,760
> I literally said that

223
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,720
So it was a really interesting challenge of  

224
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:09,760
working with these circuit traces as a 
medium because if you sort of...hang on...

225
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:20,320
So the top of the board was less challenging 
because there's a lot less going on,  

226
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:26,080
so it's like, oh there's some blank space there 
the ground plane, I can play with that. I'm  

227
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,520
sure I can do something nice there. Oh 
no the electrons have to fit through.  

228
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:38,240
But eventually we sort of iterated 
through it and went "okay you can have  

229
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:44,720
this much coral here and here and here, don't 
put anything there, stop putting things here,  

230
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,760
and you can have that fish but it can't be shiny."

231
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:58,480
But I really recommend it as an exercise. It's  

232
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,560
a really fun challenge and I'm hoping 
they'll have me back again next time,  

233
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,560
and it was an absolute pleasure, and seeing them 
all come together is just ridiculous. But...

234
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:16,879
> Yeah can i just say at this point like at the 
point where I said like "okay none of this will  

235
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:22,960
work" I honestly believed that none of it would 
work and i thought we'd have to throw that art  

236
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,400
away, and you actually managed to fit it in 
every constraint I gave you so that was amazing.

237
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:35,840
It turns out, if you have some - because I had 
no idea what I was doing, I had no idea what any  

238
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:42,800
of these chips did - I was like I've just got 
the layout and draw on top of that. It's like  

239
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:48,560
"but you can't restrict me to just one colour! 
I need board traces and I need shiny things."  

240
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:57,040
But with with actually sitting down 
and spelling out which areas to protect  

241
00:21:57,040 --> 00:22:03,280
we managed to figure out a way of communicating 
that, which hopefully we'll we'll get around to  

242
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,800
writing up some time so you can learn from 
my headaches and and so much art thrown out.

243
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:14,080
> So what stuff on there is 
cool but they won't be able  

244
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
to see because there's components on top of it?

245
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:18,080
> Right, yeah, we should show all the hidden stuff

246
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,720
Okay
> You've got the chest right there

247
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,520
So Jonty went "well it's under the water, 
can we have a treasure chest?" because it's  

248
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,440
a board about secrets and things 
so it's like okay - it has to have  

249
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,320
a hidden treasure chest which is under 
the screens on the front of the board.

250
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,679
> But please don't pry them up because 
you will break the screen if you do that.  

251
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,840
Do it really carefully

252
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:46,320
> We're running out of spares, although we do have 
some so if you need a screen fixed we can do that

253
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,720
Yeah but are they allowed to lift up the battery?

254
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,040
> Yeah gently, gently

255
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:57,360
Because if you look under the 
battery you'll find an octopus  

256
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:06,080
with a glowing golden eye which made me very 
happy. And if you need to - if you want to  

257
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,399
solder yourself to an auxiliary 
power supply you've got a nice little  

258
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:23,920
seahorse and starfish to attach onto. But 
where lots of hidden stuff is ... is on the  

259
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:33,526
extremely busy bottom board. So there's a there's 
a special request - is that the... 

260
00:23:33,526 --> 00:23:35,042
> Blåhaj

261
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:37,439
...the CPU it's under?

262
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,200
> Oh that's the memory chip

263
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,720
That's the memory chip. Okay so remember your 
sharks - remember your Ikea sharks. I put  

264
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,840
a little one of those circle accent things on 
top of the fins so you would know who it was,  

265
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,680
but there was also a special request that the 
crypto chip obviously needed a cryptid under it  

266
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:02,000
so we have Nessie there as well. 
Yeah i think that's most of it.

267
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,560
> Yeah there's also the little red board

268
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:16,000
Yes and there's - a last minute edition was 
our cool little adapter from PCBgogo like  

269
00:24:16,406 --> 00:24:21,440
"can you just maybe spruce this up a 
bit as well because it doesn't match?"

270
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:26,504
> And you did that in what, half an hour?

271
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,280
Some time. It wasn't too bad. I was like, I'm 
drawing octopuses anyway for everything else,  

272
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:40,800
I might as well add some more. And I reused the 
seahorse, that's me being lazy there. This was  

273
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:47,120
a really fun and a really amazing experience and 
like them taking the time to interface with me on  

274
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,840
making this functional, and letting me have 
free reign with the pretty was a really  

275
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:59,840
wonderful experience so thank you all so much 
for trusting me with this I had so much fun.

276
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:10,959
[applause]

277
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,280
I've been asked to point out something else which  

278
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,840
is...you might not notice unless 
you get your microscope out,  

279
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:23,600
or your magnifying glass, is that behind the weed 
- what's this area here at the end of the bus with  

280
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,840
all the fish? So if you follow the fish behind 
the weed is a Moray eel chasing a couple of fish.

281
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,760
Here. Is that working? yeah

282
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,840
> I would have missed that one

283
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:45,200
There's quite a lot on here. Have you seen 
the...there's little anemones everywhere.  

284
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,797
There's some on the front board as well around 
here, and little bits of coral. So they...it's  

285
00:25:50,797 --> 00:25:56,560
a little bit darker than I expected on the 
finished board but I hope you have fun looking  

286
00:25:56,560 --> 00:26:01,946
at it and I can't wait to play with mine so I 
hope you all have a great time with it as well.

287
00:26:01,946 --> 00:26:11,760
[applause]

288
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:17,440
So apparently i'm doing a slide as well. 
So yeah, thanks for everyone who spent  

289
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:22,240
some time hacking on the badge, whether it's 
software or hardware it's been really brilliant  

290
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,000
looking on Twitter and IRC and various social 
media things and just walking around the camp  

291
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:33,680
seeing people doing fun stuff. So there's 
games on the app store now, there's  

292
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,000
three separate pride visualisations which I 
think says a lot about EMF in a very good way,  

293
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:46,400
and there's people been doing stuff with 
the hardware as well, we made 3,500 of those  

294
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:52,080
expansion boards in red - there's still loads of 
them left so if anyone has hardware hacking ideas  

295
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:57,120
and they want some spares or some extras 
to do things, swing by the badge tent  

296
00:26:57,120 --> 00:27:01,439
probably pretty soon because I don't know 
how much longer we'll be open and and get  

297
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,960
some of those. People doing some really cool 
things with those and also the people messing  

298
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,720
around with 3D printers and building cases and 
joystick nubbins and all these wonderful things. 

299
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:19,920
It's so great to actually see people making 
use of the badge and expanding on things that  

300
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:28,952
we never even thought of doing. So, yeah thank 
you all so much. And I think that is the end.

301
00:27:28,952 --> 00:27:37,040
[applause]

302
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:42,560
BOB: I don't know why i came back up here because I 
don't have anything to say but I personally...this  

303
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,640
is one of my first times doing the kind of team 
lead role and I just want to thank the rest of  

304
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:56,400
the team for all being completely amazing. It's 
been a great badge project this year,  

305
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,520
we've got it done and we've had enough 
for everyone and it's just been...it's  

306
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,849
been really nice and I now get to sleep which is 
fantastic. So I just want to thank you everyone.

307
00:28:08,849 --> 00:28:15,714
[applause]
