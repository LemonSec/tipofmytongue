1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,320
can you hear me okay

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:06,960
look at that that's a wonder of

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,919
technology isn't it

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:11,920
okay and let's make sure that my slides

5
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,599
are advancing so with a bit of luck

6
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:15,440
you'll see some glorious high quality

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,919
animation

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,080
um so hi everyone thank you so much for

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,680
being here i really do appreciate it liz

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,599
and i are absolutely gutted that we

11
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:27,760
can't be there in person kovid as it

12
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,880
turns out sucks um i want to

13
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,120
really thank jonty and the entire av

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,559
crew for arranging this at the last

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,719
minute i really really appreciate it so

16
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,600
thanks everyone there um

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,360
because i'm not there to drink club mate

18
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,120
with you if you've got any questions or

19
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,440
comments please at me i'm at eden on

20
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,320
twitter i'm also on mastodon and myspace

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,160
and any other social network beginning

22
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:51,120
with them

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,800
basically

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
so

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,320
look just before i begin i'm not a

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,719
salesman i have nothing you can buy i

27
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,320
don't have any shares in solar panels i

28
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,800
just want to share my love of all things

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
solar and say look yes even on this

30
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
crowded miserable rainy sudden island

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,159
that we live on solar power is effective

32
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,080
it really is i'm going to give you a

33
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,280
brief overview of the kit that you need

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,280
about money

35
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,960
as well

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,240
so okay

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,439
um

38
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
i'm just going to go over a few basic

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
definitions just to make sure that we

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:40,640
are all on the same page here okay so

41
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,439
um

42
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
the amount of energy needed to move one

43
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,280
kilogram one meter is one joule uh the

44
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,640
power needed to move the kilogram a

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,439
meter in a second is one watt uh to do

46
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,079
that uh for an hour is one watt hour uh

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,479
a kilowatt hour it is a thousand watt

48
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:56,320
hours and that's what we use to measure

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
uh domestic electricity use uh if you've

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,560
got one of those old 100 watt light

51
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,399
bulbs and you leave it running for 10

52
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
hours then that uses one kilowatt hour

53
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
and the average home in the uk uses

54
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,598
about 10 kilowatt hours of electricity

55
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,480
per day that i hope is fairly simple if

56
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,239
you prefer it in

57
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:16,400
horsepower there is an equally simple

58
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,879
formula

59
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,959
so um how do solar panels work so they

60
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:25,280
are these big black glass things that

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:26,640
you sort of stick up somewhere and they

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,480
convert sunshine into delicious

63
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,319
free-range electricity

64
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,319
but how do they actually work

65
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,800
all right you probably wanted a slightly

66
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
more detailed explanation than that as

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,238
this is emf so here it is

68
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,080
what do you want from me i am not a

69
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,959
physicist look photons and they hit

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,319
panels and there's quantums and

71
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
electrons

72
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,640
here is a very practical explanation

73
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,120
photon comes down from the sun it hits

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,640
the panel and that generates direct

75
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,519
current dc that goes down a wire into a

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
box called an inverter which converts it

77
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,760
converts the direct current into

78
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,200
alternating current which is phase

79
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,120
matched with your local grid that then

80
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,519
gets fed down into your consumer unit it

81
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:12,000
enters your wires as ac

82
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,319
and then you have your gadgets converted

83
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,840
back to dc

84
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,080
so they can do stuff uh if it goes into

85
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,680
batteries then there's a further ac dc

86
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
conversion so basically dc ac ac dc

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,159
ac does everyone understood that yes

88
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:26,159
good right let's just move on

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
so

90
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,720
it is actually really really simple to

91
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,920
get started uh with with solar panels so

92
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:36,400
um all you need is a clear view of the

93
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,799
sky if you've got a roof that's great

94
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,720
but you can use any space which has a

95
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,480
clear view of the sky if you have a

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,599
balcony if you're on a flat and you've

97
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,760
got a balcony you can hang solar panels

98
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,959
off the balcony as long as they're

99
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,640
angled towards the sun they will

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,080
generate electricity if you've got a

101
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
shed or a field or a garden or anything

102
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,000
with a clear view of the sky you can use

103
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,159
solar panels um

104
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,400
a word on trees trees are the enemies of

105
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,319
solar panels you should chop down any

106
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,680
tree that use

107
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,200
that's not very environmentally friendly

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
is that look the big problem with trees

109
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,480
is they tend to cast

110
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,120
shadows and if there's solar panels in

111
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
shade it won't perform as well

112
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,680
so if you do have trees near your solar

113
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,680
panels either move your solar panels or

114
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,358
just trim the trees a little do not chop

115
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:23,120
down trees trees are our friends

116
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,320
so

117
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,479
as well as the panels themselves you

118
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,320
will need an inverter this converts as i

119
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,800
said the direct current into alternating

120
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,720
current which you can use now you need

121
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
that if you're doing this in a domestic

122
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,800
setting but if you've just got you know

123
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,080
if all you want to do is charge your

124
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
gadgets and your gadgets already used dc

125
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,080
you can just plug them straight into the

126
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
solar panels um so if you have a caravan

127
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,919
or you know you just want to charge

128
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:50,000
small gadgets you can get

129
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,160
small solar panels no inverter needed

130
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:54,000
plug your usb socket in there and you

131
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
will just get electricity flowing from

132
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,000
the sun into your gadgets which is uh

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,360
amazing

134
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,800
you will need space in your consumer

135
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,880
unit which some people call a fuse board

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,280
you will also need a generation meter if

137
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,240
you're doing this in the domestic

138
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,000
setting because the government needs to

139
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
know how much solar power you're

140
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,160
generating um and you'll probably want

141
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,120
an export tariff so um

142
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,240
most uh providers will

143
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,360
pay you

144
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,120
to sell your electricity back to the

145
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
grid this sort of bends people's minds a

146
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,960
little bit so

147
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,039
sun hits the panels electricity is

148
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,680
generated it gets used in your home but

149
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,360
if you can't use all of the electricity

150
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,720
it then flows down the wires out into

151
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,639
your neighborhood and your neighbors get

152
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,240
to use your electricity and you can get

153
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,840
paid for that because you are a power

154
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,800
station

155
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,360
which is fantastic and sometimes

156
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,360
you can get paid more to export

157
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,520
electricity and you get charged to

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
import it which is pretty cool more on

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
that later um

160
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,000
all right

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,360
you probably need a smart meter if

162
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,479
you've got an old meter it'll spin

163
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,800
backwards that's no good uh you might

164
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,039
need a new fuse for your home supply

165
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:02,880
this is free it's a 10 minute job from

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
your local power company you might need

167
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:06,960
some new wiring depends on how old and

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,039
rubbish yours is and you might want a

169
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,720
battery batteries are great for storing

170
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,560
excess electricity but

171
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,280
you don't have to store electricity as

172
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,159
electricity

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,720
you can use an immersion heater so there

174
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,400
are solar powered immersion heaters what

175
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,680
they do is they sense how much

176
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,000
electricity is being generated if you

177
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,639
are generating more than you use

178
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,080
it will switch on the immersion heater

179
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,840
and start heating up a tank of water for

180
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,240
you which means you do not need to buy

181
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,280
gas to heat your bath water or your tap

182
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,639
water or

183
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:41,360
anything else so solar panels don't just

184
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,680
replace electricity they can also

185
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:46,479
replace or supplement gas which is very

186
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:48,080
exciting all right so what do panels

187
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,479
look like they are big huge things

188
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
usually delivered by the palette um each

189
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,319
of these generates uh 315

190
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,680
ish kilowatts and although they are big

191
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,240
they are light these weigh about 19

192
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,160
kilos each you know you can easily lift

193
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,000
one by yourself they are light enough to

194
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,319
be installed on top of your roof uh

195
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,440
without your roof collapsing um or you

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
can just remove all of your tiles which

197
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,039
is what we did this is about half the

198
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,720
tiles we've removed

199
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,319
and the reason to do this is if you put

200
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,800
panels on top of your roof uh you might

201
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,960
need netting around them to stop birds

202
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,599
uh from nesting underneath them and also

203
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,039
i think this is what they look like when

204
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:28,400
they're installed so they i think

205
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,680
they're quite nice when they're flushed

206
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,639
like that you will also need scaffolding

207
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,960
lots and lots of scaffolding uh depends

208
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,479
on how tall your building is but you

209
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,319
will need people with metal poles to

210
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,160
come and bash things together great

211
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,319
so those are the panels panels installed

212
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,400
next thing is the inverter this is it

213
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,039
this is a big magic box uh you can see

214
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,479
those sort of black wires going down the

215
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,400
roof beams into there so they're

216
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,759
carrying dc

217
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,919
goes into the inverter uh it's phase

218
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,879
match with your local grid turns into ac

219
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,680
um

220
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,360
and it you know it doesn't need to be

221
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,240
wired in so has power um it makes a bit

222
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,080
of noise it's got some fans it's got

223
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,919
some relays it clunks a bit so that's

224
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,840
why it's in the loft uh but you know you

225
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,440
can put it anywhere that's sort of out

226
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,879
of the way now there are lots of

227
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,120
different models of inverters um

228
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,960
why did we choose this one well let me

229
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,080
show you a close-up and you will

230
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,759
immediately understand

231
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,240
because it has wi-fi

232
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
um and that means you can run firmware

233
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,759
updates on your solar panels who

234
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,319
wouldn't want to do that um

235
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,199
this one also has serial ports and usb

236
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,839
logging and an api

237
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,080
i just really like gadgets okay i don't

238
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,919
think i need to explain myself to an emf

239
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,360
audience gadgets are brilliant anything

240
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,719
that has an ethernet socket is

241
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,120
automatically cooler than anything that

242
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,680
doesn't uh this is the battery again

243
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,240
this is another big hefty box

244
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,600
makes a bit of noise with fans and

245
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,240
everything and despite the size this

246
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,800
only stores about two kilowatt hours so

247
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,920
about 20 of our daily domestic use

248
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
and this has sensors which clip to your

249
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:03,120
uh electricity feed and you know once it

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,120
sees our electricity is flowing out of

251
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,240
the house it starts charging um and it

252
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,399
can be set to discharge in the evening

253
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,800
or when electricity prices are high uh

254
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,480
it's great you can also see in the

255
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,720
bottom right there a home plug because

256
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,800
again this has an ethernet socket which

257
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,920
means it has

258
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,440
an api which means i can get lots of

259
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,720
data out of it which means i can draw

260
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:25,440
lots of graphs um now

261
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,920
would you like to see inside the battery

262
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
please please raise your hands if you'd

263
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,399
like to see inside the battery

264
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:34,880
ah well listen obviously do not open

265
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
batteries themselves that lets out the

266
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,360
magic smoke bad times my friends at

267
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,360
times but we can take the lid off this

268
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,120
and look inside it is some fiendishly

269
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,440
complicated circuitry

270
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:48,240
you know it's just a raspberry pi

271
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,440
everything in the world is a raspberry

272
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,560
pi now

273
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,120
my domestic batteries are raspberry pies

274
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:56,480
fantastic uh thanks even again um

275
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,200
so let's take a look at orientation how

276
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,800
do you want to place the solar panels

277
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,200
for maximum efficiency so uh liz and i

278
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:07,040
have moved house a lot and in the last

279
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,560
15 years we've lived in three different

280
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,640
houses and we fitted solar to each of

281
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:11,360
them

282
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,880
so the the best orientation uh is the

283
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,040
one on the left and that is south west

284
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,079
so you might remember from

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,440
you know

286
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,079
life that the sun rises in the east and

287
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,079
then sets in the west

288
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,000
and so anything south facing is going to

289
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,040
be illuminated by the sun but if things

290
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,240
are faced west slightly then um they

291
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,839
will be illuminated more in the

292
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,120
afternoon and evening which is great

293
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,480
because that's generally when you tend

294
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
to use a lot of uh electricity uh the

295
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,480
the middle property is where we are at

296
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,680
the moment and that has a perfect

297
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,480
east-west split so the east panels are

298
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,079
being illuminated all the way through

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,240
the morning and then at midday both of

300
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,160
them are being illuminated and then the

301
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,360
west side

302
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,959
is being illuminated all the way through

303
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,959
the evening

304
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,800
and that works really well and i've got

305
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,800
so many graphs to show you uh and on the

306
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,480
right is the worst

307
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,079
the worst orientation this is the first

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,160
place that we did which is north west

309
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,800
south east and that's rubbish uh because

310
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,160
it just

311
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,320
and yet

312
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,560
it still generates all the electricity

313
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,839
that that house needs across the gear

314
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:19,120
now okay

315
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,720
satellite photos are one thing but i

316
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,399
think we can do a bit better for that as

317
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:25,440
it's emf i'm gonna fire up the drones

318
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,399
let's see if this video works

319
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,959
no that video has not worked so

320
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
or has it worked i can't tell anymore

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,360
no can you raise your hands if you saw a

322
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,720
video

323
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,040
no one saw it oh there was a video okay

324
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,079
well hey i took that video in the very

325
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,600
brief period of time when it was legal

326
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,200
to fly a drone on your own property it

327
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,360
isn't anymore so don't do it it's

328
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,839
naughty um

329
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,880
so uh there were some things that uh

330
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,760
solar panels can't do they they are not

331
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,920
completely magic and the first is they

332
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,600
don't work in a power cut

333
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:04,000
um if you have them tied to the grid

334
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,079
there is a risk of two things first is

335
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,839
that if there's a power cut

336
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
and your uh panels aren't generating

337
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,200
enough electricity you'll suffer

338
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,279
brownouts in the home but also if you're

339
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
generating too much and you're exporting

340
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,639
it it will go to the grid and people who

341
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,839
are working on there who think that the

342
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:19,440
grid is off

343
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,200
could be hurt

344
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,519
now with some newer systems you can

345
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:24,959
reroute all of your circuitry to go

346
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,120
through um the batteries and your house

347
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,959
can be completely islanded it's a lot

348
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,240
more expensive

349
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:31,760
um

350
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,200
they don't self-clean

351
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,720
now we're really lucky in the uk because

352
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,279
it rains it rains a lot it's raining

353
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,519
today and that will just wash off any

354
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,079
bird poo or leaves or anything like that

355
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,440
which is really useful if you're in a

356
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
hotter dustier climate yes you might

357
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,160
want to

358
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:47,600
get up there with the squeegee and just

359
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,680
clean them off occasionally

360
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,760
nothing lasts forever i'm sorry to say

361
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,279
death comes to us all um

362
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,240
um

363
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,839
but solar panels

364
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,560
have uh guarantees usually for about 10

365
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,079
to 25 years

366
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,360
they will degrade over time but they

367
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,440
will follow a very predictable

368
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:09,600
degradation curve um and uh yeah so

369
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,560
if they

370
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,079
exceed that

371
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,519
sorry if they don't perform to

372
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,519
expectations uh you you should be

373
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,120
insured for that but things like

374
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,959
batteries and inverters can and will die

375
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,519
so you might want to budget for that

376
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,760
there is no way to reverse the polarity

377
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,800
to generate extra sunshine which i think

378
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,320
is a big mistake and we need to get our

379
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:31,760
top scientists working on that

380
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,720
so

381
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:35,360
okay nerds it's graphing time so uh all

382
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,360
these graphs are generated by guess what

383
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,519
raspberry pi bit of python bit php it's

384
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,120
all open source so i'm gonna get help go

385
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,160
nuts with it so this is a typical spring

386
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,639
day this is a couple of days ago

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,720
not many clouds in the sky and you can

388
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,880
see there on the left it starts

389
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:52,959
generating from the moment the sun rises

390
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,920
like 5 a.m with generating electricity

391
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,760
and then it stops generating electricity

392
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,760
when the sun sets

393
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,720
and that generated i think 24 kilowatt

394
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,240
hours in a day that's twice the amount

395
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,040
of electricity that our house used so

396
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
we used 10 and we you can think of it as

397
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,680
we used 10 and then we sold 14 back to

398
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,160
our neighbours uh now i i said that the

399
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,320
uh inverter gives me details from each

400
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
side so east and west so let's now split

401
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,240
that graph in two and show you what each

402
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,199
side

403
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:25,680
did so there we go the uh the orange is

404
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,240
the side blue is the west side now

405
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,480
what's really interesting here is you

406
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,720
can see how weather conditions can

407
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,160
affect one side but not the other so

408
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,399
there's this big dip in the east

409
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:37,920
i think about nine o'clock so there

410
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,720
obviously was some cloud cover there but

411
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,880
because the west side isn't directly

412
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,079
under the cloud cover it's just

413
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,839
receiving the diffuse light it doesn't

414
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,920
suffer as much and we can see that on

415
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,279
other days

416
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:50,160
that

417
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,680
weather conditions you know on the west

418
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,160
or the east will really only affect

419
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,000
one side if you know it's completely

420
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,839
cloudy everywhere it will affect both

421
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:00,399
sides but splitting your panels so that

422
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,000
one side's faces one way one the other

423
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:06,000
way is a really great way um to increase

424
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,399
the efficiency of the overall efficiency

425
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,480
of the system

426
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
so all right this is this is all about

427
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,639
generating electricity but what does it

428
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:17,199
do for us buying in electricity as we

429
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,040
all know fuel prices are rising and

430
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,360
rising and rising uh

431
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,399
what does this mean for us so uh we use

432
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,360
octopus energy for our provider they

433
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,279
take half hourly readings from our smart

434
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,600
meter this is from a couple of weeks ago

435
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,800
so you can see

436
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,040
sort of midnight to early morning our

437
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,600
house uses about 200 watt hours and

438
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,240
that's having the wi-fi on and you know

439
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,320
gadgets in sleep mode and you know all

440
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,920
the rest of it so we use a little bit of

441
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,360
electricity

442
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,360
which is supplemented by the batteries

443
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,680
but as soon as the sun rises

444
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,240
we stop paying for electricity

445
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,480
our smart meter knows exactly when we

446
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,839
bought electricity and when we're not

447
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
and it says oh you've stopped buying

448
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:58,399
electricity now you're actually

449
00:15:58,399 --> 00:15:59,920
exporting it

450
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
now there's a little blip there in the

451
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,560
morning that's sticking the toaster on

452
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:04,399
or the kettle on and then once that's

453
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,480
done we stopped paying for electricity

454
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,240
and you know liz and i both work from

455
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,399
home we both have laptops and screens

456
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:11,680
and everything like that and during the

457
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,480
day

458
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,399
we are not paying for electricity

459
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,600
because we are

460
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:17,680
the sun is giving it all to us there's a

461
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:18,880
blip there in the middle i think that's

462
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,240
me sticking the microwave on for a

463
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,959
delicious microwave lunch yay

464
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,199
um and then come the evening

465
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
there's a big spike there that's

466
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,920
probably you know maybe that's turning

467
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,600
on the tumble dryer or the playstation

468
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:32,000
or something like that um but yeah

469
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,079
that's just showing that on a typical

470
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:34,880
day

471
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,519
on a fairly ordinary house with solar

472
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,800
panels

473
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:40,160
you don't need to pay for electricity

474
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,959
the sun will do it all for you

475
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:44,320
and you know we're also charging up the

476
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,199
battery and discharging it now

477
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,519
what about selling electricity this is

478
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,959
great don't need to buy electricity that

479
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:53,680
has cut our energy bills heftily that

480
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,079
this is how we make money from it so

481
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,320
again i i said most energy providers

482
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
will pay you just a flat five and a half

483
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,279
p for every kilowatt hour you export to

484
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,640
your neighbours octopus

485
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:07,599
will

486
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,760
they do spot pricing on the day before

487
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,919
they say this is the half hourly price

488
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:13,919
of electricity and this is what we will

489
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:16,079
pay you so the red line there is how

490
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:17,439
much they will pay

491
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:18,720
as you can see there's more energy

492
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
demand sort of at

493
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,000
seven eight nine in the evening than

494
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,439
there is uh

495
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
earlier in the day um but you can see

496
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,599
there with those sort of thick purple

497
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,720
bars that's how much we're selling um

498
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,880
and what we can do with the battery is

499
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
say oh you know what energy prices are

500
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,480
going to be really high this evening

501
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,720
don't discharge the battery until energy

502
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,960
prices make it worthwhile it's kind of

503
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,679
up to you what you want to do um for us

504
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,520
you know it's just easier to say you

505
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,200
know what supplement our domestic use

506
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,880
when the when the toaster goes on start

507
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,720
discharging the battery rather than

508
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,960
buying in electricity uh but it's up to

509
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,919
you you know if you want to turn this

510
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,760
into a money making scheme then yeah you

511
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:57,679
can absolutely say charge the battery

512
00:17:57,679 --> 00:17:59,360
when electricity prices are low and then

513
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:02,559
discharge when they're high um

514
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:03,840
different strokes of different folks i

515
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
wish we had a bigger battery but

516
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
batteries are super expensive so

517
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,240
let's just go take a look at this is

518
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,440
last week

519
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,760
this is last week in power and it's been

520
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,360
a fairly nice week but you can see this

521
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:16,960
sort of difference in the days there you

522
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:18,480
know some days are cloudy and rainier

523
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,039
than others the yellow line is how much

524
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:23,840
um solar power we generated the blueish

525
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,160
line is how much electricity we bought

526
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,720
and when it's above zero that's us

527
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,320
buying electricity we're paying for it

528
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,320
but it's below zero that's the energy

529
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,919
company paying us for electricity um you

530
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,600
don't need to be a mathematician and do

531
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,440
lots of complex calculus to see that

532
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:42,160
come spring and summer we tend to sell

533
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,640
more electricity than we use

534
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,799
and this is again the amazing thing

535
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,200
about solar power in a domestic setting

536
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,240
is that

537
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:53,600
you end up generating so much more than

538
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,000
you can use just off a fairly ordinary

539
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,559
roof and so i'm going to show you

540
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,039
i think it's the last 14 months

541
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,440
of electricity and the property we're in

542
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,799
at the moment now you can see december

543
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:05,760
there

544
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,720
rubbish hardly generated any electricity

545
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,880
whatsoever but remember what i said

546
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
earlier

547
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,640
the average uk home uses about 10

548
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,080
kilowatt hours of electricity per day

549
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,960
call it 30 months 30 days in a month

550
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,080
that's

551
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,520
300

552
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,000
kilowatt hours per month and you can see

553
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,799
there

554
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,280
7 out of 12 months we exceed that we

555
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,480
exceed

556
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,440
that sort of 300 kilowatt hours

557
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,799
per month

558
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:37,600
in most months we generate more than we

559
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,679
use and yeah okay we can't store it all

560
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,400
so we sell it to our neighbors um

561
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,440
but i'm just showing you here that it is

562
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,280
for the majority of the time

563
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,240
solar panels will generate more than you

564
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:53,679
can use um maybe i should buy

565
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,600
less efficient electronics that's

566
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,280
another interesting thing it's just a

567
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,760
side note the average home is using less

568
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,080
electricity now than it did 10 years ago

569
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,559
because our gadgets and our fridges and

570
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,559
you know all of our appliances are more

571
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:07,760
efficient

572
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,400
which i think is interesting um

573
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,320
now months do vary you know some months

574
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:13,440
are sunnier than others you know you

575
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,559
might have a particularly rainy june or

576
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,960
or a particularly sunny uh autumn but

577
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,159
you can see there there's a bit of

578
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,000
variation um

579
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,120
so uh

580
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,720
i'm now gonna show you

581
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,440
uh another graph this is a property um

582
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
from a few years ago

583
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,000
um and again this is uh four years of

584
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,400
complete use and then uh

585
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,799
two years

586
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,159
so

587
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,159
you can see there on the left that's the

588
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
uh you know how much

589
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,159
electricity we've generated over the

590
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,120
year

591
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,120
more than 3.6 megawatt hours

592
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:53,039
off one roof and again 10 times 360.

593
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,640
yeah

594
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,799
we are generating over 100 of our

595
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,520
electricity needs um

596
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,520
i just think that it blows my mind every

597
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,600
time i see it that you know in a typical

598
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,919
house it's entirely possible to generate

599
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,960
you know

600
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,799
between three to five

601
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,480
megawatt hours

602
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,240
per per year it's not enough to charge a

603
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,559
delorean but you know it's pretty damn

604
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,520
good um so i've done this sort of big

605
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,039
overview i'm now going to sort of crash

606
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,159
zoom in to show you one day in detail

607
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,640
and this is a really nerdy graph and i

608
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:27,520
make absolutely no apologies for it it's

609
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,360
ridiculously complicated so i'm going to

610
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,799
talk you through it so

611
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,640
the yellow line is solar there is no

612
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,000
solar generated

613
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
in the morning and then sunrise yay nice

614
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,640
solar and then down and that goes great

615
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,240
um

616
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,200
red

617
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:44,080
is the electricity that we have used so

618
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,200
you can see we're using a bit of

619
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,480
electricity

620
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,000
and then there's a spike in the morning

621
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,440
a lunchtime spike and then this big

622
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,480
spike

623
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,559
in the middle is us charging an electric

624
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,240
car and you see that uses an awful lot

625
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,679
of electricity blue is the battery level

626
00:21:57,679 --> 00:21:59,600
so during the evening well you know

627
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,880
midnight to sort of seven uh our battery

628
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:05,280
very slowly discharges that's great as

629
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,200
soon as the sun rises it starts to

630
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,880
charge again are we cooking some toast

631
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,720
the battery starts discharging oh we

632
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,440
stopped carries on charging up

633
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,960
we start charging the car and the

634
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,640
battery just goes

635
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:19,440
it just pumps as much as it can into our

636
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,080
wiring which then goes into the car

637
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,679
now the

638
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:24,960
green

639
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,799
is the

640
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,880
uh electricity that we buy so you can

641
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
see sort of

642
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,559
early in the morning we're buying

643
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:33,679
the amount that we use and the amount

644
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:35,120
that we buy roughly the same as soon as

645
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,520
the sun rises yeah we stop buying

646
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,520
electricity we start selling it

647
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,080
take a look at the gap on that very big

648
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,280
i don't know why i'm pointing at the

649
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,679
camera like this i have a laser pointer

650
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:48,080
if only i could fire lasers into emf

651
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,880
um

652
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,080
that gap

653
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:52,000
between the red and the green

654
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,240
is the difference between what we use

655
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,720
and what we pay for and that difference

656
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,320
is the amount of

657
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,240
sun which is generating electricity at

658
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,440
the moment and the amount of stored

659
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:03,760
electricity from the battery so you can

660
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,679
see there is this really hefty gap on if

661
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:07,280
you've got an electric car

662
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,960
it is entirely possible to drive on

663
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,559
sunshine um you know you can set it to

664
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:15,200
slow charge just turn on when you know

665
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,720
solar power is at its

666
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,480
maximum and you can start discharging

667
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,559
your battery into your car

668
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:22,640
and that means you're paying you know

669
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,159
nothing to drive around you know if you

670
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,320
thought petrol prices were getting worse

671
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:28,640
and worse uh well good news

672
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,400
spend thousands and thousands on an ev

673
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
and solar panels and you can drive for

674
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
free

675
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,039
now of course not every day is this good

676
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,919
so um yeah it turns out solar panels

677
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,440
don't work in the snow this is why i

678
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,720
said it would be really handy if we

679
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,960
could reverse the polarity and heat the

680
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,360
solar panels and melt the snow um but

681
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
you can see there you know once the snow

682
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,640
does melt there's a you know tiny bit of

683
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,120
electricity generated um solar panels

684
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,279
work in the rain they work when it is

685
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:57,200
cloudy they work when it is foggy if you

686
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,840
can see the solar panels by sunlight

687
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,720
then

688
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,799
they will generate stuff not necessarily

689
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,640
you know gigawatts but they will still

690
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:07,039
generate even in the rather rubbish

691
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,480
british climate

692
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,440
um now i i've been graphing these solar

693
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,440
panels for years uh you know raspberry

694
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,440
pi is sucking up all the data and i

695
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:17,440
decided to publish it as open data so if

696
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,640
you want to see

697
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,960
what you know real data from real solar

698
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,880
panels is like i can go to my website

699
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,360
and download that and i am

700
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,520
blown away that people actually did that

701
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,440
um there are several proper scientific

702
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,840
papers out by proper

703
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,200
scientificians who have used my solar

704
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,600
panel data and published it it's like

705
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,799
wow brilliant cool um anyway

706
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
as we get to the end let's talk about

707
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
the elephant in the room which is cost

708
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,120
um i really like this tweet that someone

709
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,120
did which is you know you rarely ask

710
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:48,960
well yeah what's the payback on getting

711
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,919
a new bathroom or stuff like that

712
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:54,240
for me solar panels are environmentally

713
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,679
like kind of a moral

714
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,320
uh issue but you know i appreciate they

715
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,919
cost money and they make money it does

716
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
make me feel like mr burns sometimes you

717
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,200
know i see a nice sunny day and i think

718
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,440
i'm making loads of money from the sun

719
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,279
so selling back makes a significant

720
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,960
amount of money especially if you've got

721
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,120
a time of day tariff you can see that

722
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,880
again a brief graph just showing that

723
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
you know every day or every week how

724
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,960
much money can make from from selling

725
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:21,039
back so i'm gonna i'm gonna go through

726
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,159
and do some quick maths with you

727
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:24,880
so

728
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,559
um

729
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,080
the cost of equipment is going to vary

730
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
it will depend on government subsidies

731
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,440
it will depend on how complicated your

732
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,240
house is um if local councils quite

733
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
often have group buying schemes uh how

734
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:38,320
many panels you need

735
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,720
but if you you know if you just want to

736
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,480
buy a few panels to charge up gadgets

737
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:44,640
you know you can buy them for for tens

738
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:46,880
to hundreds of pounds on

739
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,120
online if you want domestic installed on

740
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,240
your roof

741
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,240
expect to pay between three thousand and

742
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,799
twelve thousand pounds now that is a big

743
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:57,440
chunk of change and it's a big gap um

744
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:58,880
and it really is going to depend on you

745
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:00,320
know local installers and local

746
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,080
conditions but it is worth you know

747
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,240
getting lots of different quotes um and

748
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:05,919
seeing how much you know

749
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:07,520
your roof can uh

750
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,919
compare um there is that cost of

751
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,080
installation um especially if you need

752
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,760
scaffolding on on both sides or if

753
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,840
you've got you know really tricky

754
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:16,720
um

755
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:19,279
wiring that needs uh doing there is a

756
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:21,600
bit for maintenance um so you know you

757
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,760
might need to replace some things

758
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,200
you probably don't need to wash down the

759
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,120
panels but you might want to budget for

760
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,400
that

761
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,640
and then this is the other big cost the

762
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,840
cost of changing your habits

763
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,039
so

764
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:36,720
do you want to live in a world where you

765
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,559
can only use the microwave when the sun

766
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,000
is shining

767
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,120
that you can only turn the oven on when

768
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,039
the battery is full

769
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,960
you probably don't but you might find

770
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,559
yourself changing your habits to go oh

771
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:49,840
you know what

772
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,360
i can see the weather forecast is going

773
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,520
to be sunnier in the afternoon so that's

774
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,360
when i'll schedule the dishwasher to go

775
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,240
on changing habits is hard um you know

776
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,679
saying oh well i only want to charge my

777
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:01,840
car when it's the sun is shining might

778
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,400
leave you with not enough mileage but

779
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,720
that that's worth thinking about but

780
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,520
there are financial rewards as well so

781
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
you can sell electricity back to the

782
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,640
grid which is great but also you don't

783
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,320
pay for electricity when the sun is

784
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,440
shining

785
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,320
now we did the maths on this um a few

786
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,799
months ago before the latest price rises

787
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,200
and for our house with the sort of i

788
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,720
think five kilowatt

789
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:30,080
uh panels on our roof

790
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,080
our panels

791
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,760
basically save us

792
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,080
at least 800 pounds a year

793
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,200
and that's a mixture of selling energy

794
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,640
selling electricity and not buying it um

795
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,799
if electricity prices go up that's going

796
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,640
to go up as well so you can start to

797
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,320
work out well what's the payback time

798
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,320
you know if i'm spending eight thousand

799
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,919
pounds on panels and i'm saving 800

800
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:53,840
pounds per year these 10 years a good

801
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,279
payback period you can work that out for

802
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,600
yourself

803
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:00,080
there's also improvement to your energy

804
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,919
performance certificate so if you want

805
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,600
to sell the property you need an epc

806
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,960
higher epc is it's good so that helps

807
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,640
make your money but i think the most

808
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,600
important thing is moral smugness can

809
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,520
you really put a price on how good it

810
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,559
feels to be an hippie i don't think you

811
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:19,520
can um look what i wanted to say and

812
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,039
what i hope i encourage you to

813
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:22,799
understand with this talk is that solar

814
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,039
panels work not only do they work they

815
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:28,559
work really well in the uk and if you

816
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:30,880
install them and if you get inverters

817
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:31,840
with

818
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,159
uh apis and batteries with ethernet

819
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:36,559
ports you can start doing really cool

820
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:39,360
nerdy things with electricity um and i

821
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,279
think that's brilliant i want to thank

822
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:43,360
you so much for for coming to my talk i

823
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,600
really do appreciate you taking the time

824
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:47,200
and i look forward to seeing you at the

825
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,440
next emf

826
