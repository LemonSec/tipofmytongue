00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:03,120
Hello Electromagnetic Field.

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:05,200
> woo

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,640
That's a lukewarm response.
Hello Electromagnetic Field!

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,080
> Wooo!

5
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,280
For those of you who don't 
know me, I am Matt Gray. I'm  

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,720
@MattGrayYes on all of the socials and 
I've been on that there YouTube for a bit.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,800
So I spent a lot of time on social 
media. Doing a lot of the scrolling,  

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,479
especially in the last couple of years, sat at 
home with nothing much to do. Hands up if you've  

9
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:39,040
spent a little bit too long doing the scrolling. 
That is everyone. I think that is everyone, wow.  

10
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:48,080
So I am going to talk about my three steps to try 
and help stop doing the doomscroll, spending all  

11
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:55,839
of your time on it. Because I'm - we're all guilty 
of it - we've all spent too long doing it. Sounds  

12
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,040
too easy. Okay, the three steps. Number one 
live, number two laugh, number three love.

13
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,879
[laughter]
[applause]

14
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:14,800
Nah. First step is remove the doom. Step two, 
stop yourself from scrolling. And step three is  

15
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:20,080
find the reason that you are scrolling. So I'm 
going to go through each of those three steps.

16
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,360
Now you are seeing this presentation 
without slides, but I did only make the  

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:36,000
slides this morning because I'm used to having 
the advantage of video editing to support me,  

18
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,640
and I do that after i've done all the talking, and 
I chop it all up, so then all the good bits remain.  

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:47,520
So you're gonna get to see the bad bits too. 
And I'm still on the path of recovery from  

20
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,840
post viral fatigue at the moment so there might 
be a moment where i'd just start buffer.....ing.

21
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,640
So if I start buffering you can fill that 
gap by giving me a round of applause?

22
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,120
[applause]

23
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,240
That'll take you long enough, 
and I'll maybe get a moment  

24
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,640
to think about what I'm trying to 
say, and then I'll be back again.

25
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,519
So, social networks.  

26
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:21,360
I'm intrigued. Out of all the ones that we've got 
about at the moment which ones do you use? On the  

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
count of three, all of you at once just yell what 
social network you use the most. Three, two, one.

28
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,959
[incomprehensible yelling]

29
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,000
So I heard more "Twitter"s than anything 
there. I thought that was going to be useless,  

30
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,840
but i heard a lot of "Twitter"s, 
wow. So hands up for Twitter?

31
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,040
That's the majority of people. Facebook?

32
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
Two people at the back there. Instagram?

33
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,160
About half. TikTok?

34
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:50,800
About the same as Instagram. Snapchat?

35
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,920
One person at the back there! 
And finally, Friends Reunited?

36
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,960
One person! I didn't even know it still existed.

37
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,520
So for me, the main thing I use is Twitter 
and Instagram. It's probably just a sign of  

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:16,204
my age - they're the ones that have been around 
since...long...time. There's the buffering.

39
00:03:16,204 --> 00:03:18,232
[applause]

40
00:03:18,232 --> 00:03:20,608
I had already forgotten I'd said that!

41
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,760
So step one: remove the doom. 
My experience is with Twitter,  

42
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,600
mainly, and Instagram. So i'm gonna 
focus on that kind of thing but you can  

43
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:36,480
use these points on anything else you might be 
using. So, first thing on Twitter you can remove  

44
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,560
the doom. You're scrolling - there's a load of 
crap there - there'll be the odd person that,  

45
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,880
you always scroll past their posts and you 
never read them. Just unfollow them. Why?

46
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
And the best thing about Twitter, and most 
social media right now, is that friendship  

47
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,480
is not mutual. If someone that you know follows 
you, you do not have to follow them back, and  

48
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,679
if they ask you about it you go "nah, 
don't want that, I see you in real life."

49
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,600
Done. And if, for whatever ~political reason~ 
you have to follow them back, it's just going  

50
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:19,120
to make life easier, then you can mute them. 
They don't know that. More about muting later.

51
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,240
So you don't have to read every post 
either. Once you've unfollowed all the  

52
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,920
people that you're scrolling past, well 
you've got less less to scroll anyway,  

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:33,600
and there is no point being completionist 
about the internet. You are never going to  

54
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,080
finish the internet. There will always be more 
internet. Has anyone here completed the internet?

55
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,560
No. No. No one's completed the 
internet so it's not going to happen.  

56
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,160
I used to try and complete the internet - I don't 
know why - I think it was just habitual scrolling.  

57
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,760
I'd get home from work at the end of the 
day and scroll Twitter until I ran out.  

58
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,520
It didn't do me any good - I didn't feel 
better at the end of it. So you've just gotta  

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,120
try and notice if you're doing that, and maybe try 
not to? There are more tools though that can help  

60
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,640
you. So Twitter: you can turn off retweets. if 
you didn't know that - if there's someone that's  

61
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,640
always retweeting something, turn it off. You'll 
only see the stuff that they're actually posting.

62
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,240
And recognise some of the stuff that's 
getting slipped into feeds these days,  

63
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:24,080
so there's suggested posts, there's ads, fake 
notifications. You get a notification because  

64
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:32,479
"hey, you last did this a year ago." It's not to 
remind you of the thing. They're not being nice.  

65
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,320
It's giving you that little rush of "ooh! I've 
got a thing! I've got something to look at!"

66
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,320
Facebook is horrific at this. I rarely use 
Facebook, but when I do log in there's always  

67
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:48,800
a hundred notifications about...bollocks that 
doesn't matter. I'm never gonna click any of them.  

68
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,680
LinkedIn's the same - not that I actually 
use that - but that's always full of  

69
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,600
notifications whenever I rarely check it. 
And Twitter does it in subtle ways too.  

70
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,640
You can get a notification for every single 
time a tweet is liked - now I realise that's a  

71
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,919
more of a problem in my end of things. As soon 
as you get more than maybe 10,000 followers,  

72
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:12,000
Twitter gets a little overwhelming. You don't need 
10,000 people's opinion on everything you post.

73
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,604
ththththththth

74
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,578
uhhhh

75
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:24,000
[applause]

76
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,039
That works!

77
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,919
The official Twitter app is awful at it, as 
well. So the majority of my feed on the official  

78
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:42,000
Twitter app: it's likes, it's trends, it's big 
news. I don't go on social media to work out  

79
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,640
what's happening. I work in the media - I hear news 
throughout my day job, all day every day. I get my  

80
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:53,919
news from reading different newspapers' websites. 
I try and get a wide range of spectrum of opinions  

81
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,760
so I can form my own opinion. Whereas Twitter, 
I follow things that make me laugh - give me a  

82
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:03,039
break from the real world. Because I spend the 
whole time in the real world - the internet has  

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:09,120
always been my escape and then as soon as big news 
happens it starts coming in. If Twitter's only  

84
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,680
showing me things people are liking and big trends 
then that means the news dominates the feed.

85
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,440
And then Instagram's got a little bit better 
with the random crap it's shoving in your feed.  

86
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,640
I realise their algorithm seems to be completely 
different for everyone but for me, I can reach  

87
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,840
the bottom of Instagram! I get to the bottom 
and it goes "nah, you've seen everything for  

88
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,239
the last three days." That's it. And it doesn't 
show me any more which is quite good. But I was  

89
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,280
sat next to someone two days ago and it didn't 
do that for them, so who knows? Facebook, eh.

90
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:54,720
The other way of removing the doom is 
muting. I don't use the official Twitter app,  

91
00:07:54,720 --> 00:08:02,480
I use TweetBot. It's iOS and Mac only so, sorry 
if you don't use them. I'm sure there's another  

92
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:08,560
alternative. But it has the advantage that you 
can mute users, you can mute specific phrases,  

93
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:17,120
you can mute hashtags. I have mute 
filters set up for politicians' names,  

94
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:22,560
words about nasty things that happen 
in news like violent acts, war,  

95
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:30,000
TV shows that I don't care about. None of that 
ends up in my Twitter feed. I'm specifically  

96
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:37,440
creating my own filter bubble so then I don't see 
the nasty stuff and it can still be an escape,  

97
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,640
and that has taken me effort to do but I have a 
much better time of it. I can have a break from  

98
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,000
the real world and I create this filter bubble 
knowing that it's not my main source of news. So  

99
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,240
I've got things like at the moment: Putin, NFT 
- I will never see anything that's saying NFT.  

100
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:07,840
It makes the internet a much better place. Words 
like Rees-Mogg, referendum, #apprentice

101
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,560
I'm just scrolling through some of them 
now. #bbuk - when was the last time Big  

102
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,160
Brother was even on? I haven't - I don't go 
through and clear them out - #gbbo2017 - I  

103
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,199
should probably go through and clear 
them out because, yeah. #harryandmegan

104
00:09:25,369 --> 00:09:29,600
#F1 - people who like F1 seem to be 
the type of people who don't tweet.  

105
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
They'll tweet the odd thing, 
and then the F1 comes on.  

106
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,960
[frantic tweeting noises]

107
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:37,040
I don't see any of them, because they're nice, they 
hashtag them. I've muted that hashtag. It's great.

108
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,319
And these features are also available on other 
platforms. So Instagram, you can press and hold  

109
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:53,840
on someone's story at the top, and you can mute 
either their story or their whole profile. So  

110
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,280
then you won't see just the story things, or 
you won't see anything from them, but you're  

111
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:04,240
still following them. That's useful if you've got 
the ~political~ friendship reasons why you have  

112
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,000
to follow them otherwise they'd be sad. But you 
don't have to follow them, just unfollow them.

113
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:14,960
Doesn't mean you don't talk to them any more. 
YouTube has similar as well, so you'll get lots  

114
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:19,440
of recommendations of videos you might want to 
watch on YouTube. I will occasionally get lots of  

115
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:25,120
recommendations - let's say I watched a video with 
some Lego in it. Lego is one of those topics that,  

116
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,240
as soon as I watch one video on it, that's all it 
wants to recommend to me. Same with solar power.  

117
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,480
You suddenly get from one type of electronic 
engineering and BAM, you're in vanlife.  

118
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:42,000
Everything's vans. And you can't escape. Oh 
god it's gone into composting toilet mode.  

119
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,600
And I don't want to go any further than composting  

120
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,440
toilet mode - I like my porcelain 
actually, I think plumbing's great.

121
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:55,920
But what you can do, is you can click the little 
dot dot dot, and you can click "don't recommend  

122
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,160
channel" or "not interested" and it goes "no 
I don't like that topic." Do it on two videos  

123
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:08,640
it goes "oh, he doesn't want to spend...four 
hours? On a composting toilet build montage?"  

124
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:15,520
and then it stops showing me it. It's 
nice. It makes it a better place.

125
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,880
TikTok as well. Okay, not so many of 
you here are using it. I kind of like  

126
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,680
TikTok. Very addictive. It's an infinite 
scroll, so it's dangerous in that respect,  

127
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:32,480
but I find its algorithm is much better than any 
other social medias at working out what I want  

128
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,680
to watch and showing me more of it. I think it 
bases it a lot on dwell time and how long you're  

129
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,239
watching a thing, but if you press and hold a 
video on TikTok there's the "not interested"  

130
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,040
button. For some reason two weeks ago 
it just kept showing me car crashes.

131
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:54,560
Why is anyone uploading car crashes? I don't know. 
I said "not interested" on two of them and it  

132
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,680
stopped showing them. It's actually - it's great. 
You can craft what you're seeing online to not be  

133
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,120
the crap you don't want to see. And it 
makes the whole thing just a lot better,  

134
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,760
and means you're less likely just to keep... 
scrolling and scrolling forever for no reason.

135
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:16,800
So we move on from step one to step two. So you've 
removed the doom - you've unfollowed people,  

136
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,839
you've muted everything, now 
you need to stop scrolling.  

137
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,000
You can do it for a bit, just remember: 
yes, starting to scroll the socials is easy.  

138
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:33,920
The hard bit is stopping. So that's step 
two. Staying up to date on current affairs,  

139
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:40,160
it's fine, it's great - great thing to do, 
but you don't have to be immersed in it 24/7.

140
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:46,560
There will always be more news. There will always 
be more internet. You will never complete the  

141
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,199
internet. You will never complete the news. Stay 
up to date, check it every so often, you don't  

142
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,200
have to keep refreshing to get the latest. Dip 
in, get a bit of it and then you can leave again.

143
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:00,000
Like I was saying, I try and treat the 
internet as my escape from the real world,  

144
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,240
because there's enough bullshit out here 
without it needing to be in your safe space,  

145
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,160
in your bedroom, just as you're falling asleep, 
seeing all the shit that's going on everywhere.

146
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,400
And one thing that can help with this - 
saying "stop scrolling" yeah, yeah that's  

147
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:20,720
really useful, yeah - but there are tools you can 
use to help you with that. So "screen time settings"  

148
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:26,800
is what it's called in iOS. I'm pretty sure it's 
called screen time settings as well in Android - I  

149
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,839
don't know - I've never used one. But you can tell 
your phone "oi, when I spend too long on this app,  

150
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:41,840
tell me not to." And you can get it to set a 
password and stuff on it. In the last few weeks,  

151
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:46,240
and over the whole Covid thing, I've actually 
got a hurty thumb from the amount that I've been  

152
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,600
on my phone. More time spent sat inside, sat on 
the sofa bored, because yes we haven't been able  

153
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:57,280
to sit with each other in a field talking about 
geeky stuff. So my thumb has spent so long in this  

154
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:04,480
position here, it's hurt. So I've done things to 
stop me scrolling too much and now it hurts less.

155
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,560
> yay!

156
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:13,359
And you can end up in a habit loop of 
just constantly refreshing the same thing.  

157
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
Just open that up, then I open that up, then 
I open that, and you just end up in a loop.  

158
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:25,120
I re-jiggled all of the apps on my home screen so 
I can't find them anymore. That worked wonders. I  

159
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,480
deleted the ones that are crap. I logged out of 
them. I turned on these screen time settings.  

160
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:38,400
After one hour in the Twitter official app 
or TweetBot it'll go "no, you spent too long  

161
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,720
in this app, it's now locked" you can enter 
in a password and we'll give you one minute  

162
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,000
or 15 minutes on it, or we'll 
unlock it for the entire day.  

163
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:51,120
But that's a reminder - if you keep - yes I'll 
end up going 15 minutes, 15 minutes, 15 minutes,  

164
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,960
but it's like a slap around the face every 
time I keep doing it and eventually it makes  

165
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:58,400
me stop a bit quicker than I would have done 
otherwise. And you can do that for specific  

166
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,920
apps or for categories, so you can do it for 
all social media or everything on your phone.

167
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,560
Hell, I even got to a point a few years 
ago where i was habitually refreshing  

168
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,319
Facebook on my computer so much. It was 
just a habit - there was nothing there!  

169
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:15,760
I didn't even like it. I was just in a 
habit from having used it for 15 years.  

170
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:21,120
I ended up setting up a hosts file on my 
computer that pointed facebook.com to localhost.  

171
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,120
It just didn't work anymore, and I kept 
doing the action and it just kept giving  

172
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:32,640
me nothing and then I slowly weaned myself 
out of that, so it kind of did the job.

173
00:15:34,756 --> 00:15:36,601
And then number three.

174
00:15:37,969 --> 00:15:43,520
You have removed the doom, you have
stopped yourself from scrolling,

175
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,920
and then the final bit is: find 
the reason that you're scrolling.  

176
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:52,640
There's nothing wrong with spending time on 
things but, if you're putting your all into it,  

177
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,360
or if you're lying awake until 3am constantly 
scrolling...keep an eye on yourself.  

178
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,440
It's easy for it to become a habit - I've 
spoken about how that became a habit for me  

179
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,840
and the only way you can get out of 
that kind of habit is by noticing it.  

180
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,360
I've used it when I've been stressed or 
depressed - it's a distraction. You're  

181
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,880
not thinking about that anymore. And you can't 
distract yourself forever. Your mental health  

182
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,840
is as important as your physical health so you 
need to take the same amount of care for it.  

183
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,360
And if you need help with that, get it. Your 
friends will be happy to talk to you about it,  

184
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,862
and if not then we have a wonderful health 
service here they'll be able to help you too.

185
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:43,520
And then finally, we've got the three steps: so 
you've removed the doom - there's less shit in  

186
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:46,640
front of you for you to scroll through, so 
there's nice stuff there. You're not going  

187
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,560
to be scrolling as often, and hopefully you 
keep an eye on yourself and you're not doing  

188
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:55,359
it for the wrong reasons - to cover up the 
crap that's hiding in the back of your mind.

189
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,079
Then you've got to remember, the stuff 
that you're seeing on social media  

190
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:06,800
is all cherry-picked. It's not the full aspect of 
the person - people are a brand - you even do it  

191
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,399
yourself. When you post a photo online, you're 
not just picking any picture. You're going "oh  

192
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,040
which one's the good one? oh I look like a twat 
in that one, I'm not going to use that one. oh  

193
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:20,560
my eye's doing something funny in that one." 
Everyone does that. People are a brand. You will  

194
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:25,440
see someone's photos - you'll see someone's post 
- it looks like they're having fun all the time  

195
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:30,080
because why would you share the crap? You're 
going to share the stuff you're excited about.  

196
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,440
So you've got to remember that's not the full 
aspect of a person, or if someone's annoyed one  

197
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,360
day about a thing and complaining about a thing, 
it doesn't necessarily mean it's their all.  

198
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:46,000
And same with beauty standards as well, like 
I was saying. It's one of 50 photos that  

199
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
someone's posted if they're a beauty 
influencer or a fashion influencer,  

200
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:56,159
just before you let any of this kind of thing 
embed itself inside you, you've got to remember  

201
00:17:56,160 --> 00:18:01,840
to take that as what it is: it is a brand, it is 
marketing. It's just this new - well not really  

202
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:07,760
new, I've been on social media for 12 years now 
haven't I? Let's call it new, in the grand scheme  

203
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:11,440
of the universe, it's the new way of marketing
humans at each other.

204
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,959
So there you go, that's it 
really, that's my waffle about  

205
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:22,640
how not to get embedded too much in the socials. 
Remove the doom, stop yourself from scrolling,  

206
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,520
and try not to do it for the wrong reasons.

207
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,600
I am Matt Gray, I am MattGrayYes on all 
the socials, mattg.co.uk. And I will not be  

208
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,719
around immediately after this talk because 
I've got to rush off, but come find me,  

209
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
come say hi. I'm going to be around for the rest 
of the weekend. And in the lounge, which is the  

210
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,800
white tents near the bar, I have a pile of Game 
Boys and a Game Boy camera that's connected to a  

211
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:45,760
dot matrix printer. You can go there now, you can 
go have a play with them, they're free to play.  

212
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:51,566
I like Game Boys. So feel free to 
have a play with them, and that is it.

213
00:18:51,566 --> 00:18:54,536
[applause]
