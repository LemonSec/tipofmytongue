1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,720
[Applause]

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,440
um hello yeah this is um

3
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,920
a sort of state of play of a project i'm

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,000
working on uh for building my own

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,320
electric motorcycle

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,560
because

7
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,480
i've built various other

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,119
other motorcycles and

9
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:25,359
now moved on to something electric it's

10
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:28,160
it's using the

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,400
the

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,680
the methods and and systems the uh an

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,079
online group called o2 open inverter

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,239
dodge and and their forum have been

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,520
generated which takes a slightly

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:40,800
different approach

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,040
to hacking the components of

18
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,640
electric vehicles and hybrid parts

19
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
i almost called this um talk uh how i'm

20
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:50,719
building a monstrous electric vehicle

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,399
from hacked scrap electric vehicle parts

22
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,399
but my project was on motorcycles so

23
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,840
that's what i chose as the um as the

24
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,280
topic um

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,160
and

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,960
with things like this is is why um

27
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,239
as

28
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,680
uh the

29
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,400
uh the guy just said i built a diesel

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,080
motorcycle in fact i built several

31
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,880
diesel motorcycles four in total

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,280
one of them had a volkswagen tdi golf

33
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,119
engine in it

34
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:19,600
which was a turbo diesel bike and that

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
worked really well and now i'm looking

36
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,520
at moving on to something a bit more

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,000
up to speed with current technology

38
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,560
i've also worked on many self-built

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,200
electric vehicles i i used to

40
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,520
work part-time or help a guy that sort

41
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,119
of built and mended and and converted

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,920
cars and kit cars but that was i know

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,759
whole numbers about 10 years ago and it

44
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,759
was all lead acid batteries big dc

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
motors and

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,159
and

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,840
similar so it's very different to what's

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,680
available now

49
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,200
i remember

50
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,200
when i was doing that the the very new

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,360
cars on the on the game were the the

52
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,960
prius and the leaf

53
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:01,280
and they're now

54
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,560
um very established uh vehicles i also

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,799
enjoy technical challenge i i quite like

56
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,038
that sort of thing uh the novelty the

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:10,720
naughty do my own one i put a question

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,319
mark there because electric vehicles are

59
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,400
no longer novel

60
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
uh and i got cheap because it's cheaper

61
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,480
than buying new uh again that's a

62
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,400
relative thing because you've got your

63
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,720
time and of course as i'll mention later

64
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,720
on the batteries are there's no cheap

65
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,560
way around that um

66
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,400
an economy of use

67
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,640
um and then right at the bottom the time

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,000
is right

69
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,800
um and this is because uh electric

70
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,599
vehicles and hybrids especially are

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,280
being around long enough that they're

72
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,120
now in the breakers they're they're

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
being broken there's nothing special

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,160
about the parts

75
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,599
which makes them

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,360
cheap and especially the price which is

77
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,000
what i'm going to focus on

78
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
you can pick up parts of those the the

79
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,080
the those prices are just not special at

80
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,319
all it's it's quite good so the time is

81
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,159
right for that

82
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,440
and i'll go over briefly in this

83
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,360
presentation about the main components

84
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
being the motor the battery uh briefly

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,000
about battery management i'm not going

86
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,959
to go into

87
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,519
that in detail uh the inverter or the

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
power controller used for controlling

89
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,720
the motor

90
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,120
um charging and then i was gonna have a

91
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
section on chassis and wheels but

92
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,519
decided i couldn't really get it into

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,159
half an hour um and besides the project

94
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:27,360
really hasn't gone that far so um

95
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,360
um the rest of the presentation is

96
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,959
mostly going to be on how i'm going to

97
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,799
do it rather than my previous

98
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,319
presentations which is in the blow by

99
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,360
blow stage of of assembly to get over

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,080
mechanical issues

101
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,760
so i'll start with

102
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,440
things in a different order than my list

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
so i'll start with the battery

104
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,560
so looking at existing electric vehicles

105
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,799
i've just picked two at random being the

106
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,200
zero which is a sports bike and the

107
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:56,080
harley-davidson live wire which is more

108
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,920
of a cruiser

109
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,360
just for a ballpark

110
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,799
look at

111
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,959
how far you go and and the one has a

112
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,239
14.4 kilowatt hour battery in it and the

113
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:07,840
other one has a 15.5 kilowatt hour

114
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,840
battery in it and the one has a range

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,159
depending on

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
how fast you go which is is wind

117
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
resistance and and the start of riding

118
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,399
is between

119
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:21,358
112 and 156 so these are the sales

120
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:25,919
um quotes and the harley of 110 246 so

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,160
you know you've got about between 100

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
and about 150 miles out of those two um

123
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,600
which gives you an idea of how many

124
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,600
watts or what hours

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:38,560
in energy per mile they're doing

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,560
and from that you can back calculate and

127
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,320
say well i'm building a similar vehicle

128
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,199
with similar aerodynamics and a similar

129
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,120
size with

130
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,680
you know a similar chassis arrangement

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,000
compared to a car

132
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,240
so i'm going to get a similar

133
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,120
power requirement uh than these which

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,040
helps it's very difficult to work these

135
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,160
things out

136
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,479
um in advance with any great technical

137
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,880
accuracy

138
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,240
um

139
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,160
you can buy new batteries but what i'm

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,000
looking at is is what's in the breakers

141
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,639
what can you buy

142
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:13,840
and

143
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,840
as i've mentioned the hybrids and the

144
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,440
electric vehicles are in the breakers

145
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
and unless you know what you're doing

146
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,880
these these are quite weird things

147
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,440
there's a lot of places that still

148
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,199
terribly frightened they're terrified of

149
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,440
being electrocuted which is a

150
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,720
potential

151
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,360
problem but most of the the batteries is

152
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,280
is when you cut the main 12 volt

153
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,919
supply to it because all electric

154
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,199
vehicles and hybrids have a 12 volt

155
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
battery for running the lights and the

156
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,199
radio and all the other systems uh as a

157
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,520
conventional car with with the same

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,680
voltage range of a 12 volt battery once

159
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,880
you cut that

160
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:52,240
internal internally to the the large

161
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:54,240
traction battery there's contactors

162
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,160
which isolate it so unless those

163
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,880
isolators have malfunctioned uh you take

164
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,479
the 12-volt battery off the electric car

165
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,800
and the battery is safe to handle as a

166
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
battery i mean when you take the lid off

167
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,039
that's a different matter

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,759
the technology of batteries is

169
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,440
is as we all know it's all lithium

170
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,720
a majority are prismatic or rectangular

171
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,639
cells in the electric cars i believe

172
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:20,080
there's only one manufacturer i can

173
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,919
think of that still uses cylindrical

174
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,880
cells that's you know

175
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,680
um

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,240
a choice i don't know why everyone uses

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,759
rectangular cells and then and then

178
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
another another company still is random

179
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,600
ones i've i've not looked into the

180
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,039
technical details enough to know why

181
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,840
that's chosen

182
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,680
but when looking at um

183
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,840
buying batteries it's uh it's a risky

184
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,120
market because you don't know if you're

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,400
buying a dead one or a good one or

186
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,160
you know you take the case out it's full

187
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,360
of bricks it's it's um

188
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,360
it's uh

189
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
you've got to do a bit of homework and

190
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,479
trust the person you're buying it from

191
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:01,759
will turn up with multimeters and tools

192
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,960
you can't just put a multimeter on

193
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,319
electric vehicle battery you have to

194
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,319
take the lid off and measure the cells

195
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:07,919
um

196
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:08,880
uh

197
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,400
there's a variant on that but i'll come

198
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,160
to that later on

199
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,880
so so the cost of the batteries i i

200
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,919
spent a lot of time surfing ebay and

201
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,120
online

202
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,759
suppliers

203
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,599
for

204
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:25,280
for a second-hand battery and it was

205
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,880
very difficult to say is it a good deal

206
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,520
is it not until

207
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
i realized that if you look at the

208
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,599
cost of the stored energy rather than

209
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,919
the absolute cost of a battery pack so

210
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,240
um gone into

211
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,080
there we go

212
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,800
gone into screen save mode

213
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,919
that's come back um

214
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,840
so if you look at the battery of

215
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,879
kilowatt

216
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:52,879
hours as the actual energy storage

217
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,240
divided by the cost of the actual

218
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,919
battery you end up with

219
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,240
kilowatt hours uh sorry price per

220
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,879
kilowatt hour and a low good price is is

221
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,720
120 pounds per kilowatt hour um if you

222
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,560
just generally go looking and and they

223
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,720
go up and up and up to 300 pounds

224
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,560
kilowatt hour even more um so some

225
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,080
people ask ridiculous prices because

226
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,440
they still think that

227
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,120
electric vehicle parts are really

228
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
special and people still pay the money

229
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
and the other thing is when looking for

230
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
batteries is the known brands are always

231
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,919
the favorites when people say oh let's

232
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,879
buy a let's buy a

233
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:32,240
traction battery from electric vehicle

234
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,559
for running a project uh whether it be

235
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
motorcycle or hacky racer or something

236
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,399
oh yes lose the leaf we've heard of the

237
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
leaf and someone else says no let's use

238
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,360
the tesla battery because they've heard

239
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,200
of the tesla and they've seen the the

240
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,480
media propaganda that says they're the

241
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,399
best in the world um and then they

242
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,320
ignore the fact that there's there's now

243
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,040
dozens of electric vehicles and hybrids

244
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,240
and

245
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,760
um

246
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,920
these stop start cars have nice 48 volt

247
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,959
batteries

248
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,720
uh lithium batteries that are quite high

249
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
discharge rate um the price of those

250
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,600
hasn't dropped yet um so

251
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,880
you could kind of think out the box a

252
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,880
bit and just look at them as

253
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:11,120
cells rather than branded parts

254
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:15,839
so what i chose was a bmw i3 battery

255
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,240
and there it is outside of its ink

256
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:20,000
enclosure

257
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
each one of those eight modules uh

258
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,600
weighs

259
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
i think it's 20 kilos

260
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,760
which is quite high but

261
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,839
not ridiculous compared to the the big

262
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,760
turbo diesel motorcycle i bought when

263
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,880
you think about the whole weight of the

264
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
vehicle

265
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,240
and for scale there's a pair of gloves

266
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,640
and the actual motor there all laid out

267
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,519
um as it was beginning of the

268
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,880
this was about a month before the

269
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,200
pandemic hit and

270
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,720
i was all keen to work on it and then

271
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,480
the pandemic here and and i had all the

272
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
time in the world

273
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,880
but very limited income so basically the

274
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,560
project has been on hold until this

275
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,959
spring again because i couldn't afford

276
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,320
to invest in it anymore but anyway um

277
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,680
it's a 96 cell uh battery

278
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,720
uh 94 amp hours it's 33 kilowatt hours

279
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,160
of

280
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,200
um

281
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,200
of power

282
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,240
um and it's in 12 uh

283
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,320
so eight 12 cell modules for each module

284
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,480
is is 20

285
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,279
uh

286
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,399
uh

287
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,760
48 volts

288
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,279
um and the other interesting thing

289
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,399
whether i

290
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:28,480
cover it now or later on is each of

291
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,240
those modules has its own battery

292
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,480
management system attached to it and

293
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,839
then they're daisy chained around

294
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:36,090
the

295
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,279
[Music]

296
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,640
the pack

297
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,720
and then when i come on to

298
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,079
talk about battery management in a

299
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:44,399
moment

300
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,160
our people have reverse engineered the

301
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
protocols so you don't have to put your

302
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,519
own battery management system on it you

303
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
can use the existing one and then use

304
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,600
the hacked and open now not open source

305
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,680
but reverse engineered codes for um

306
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,600
for

307
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,560
for then

308
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
integrating that into your own system

309
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,560
um

310
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,079
one of the common things people say when

311
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,680
i say i'm thinking about building a

312
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,680
electric vehicle is oh no they say the

313
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,040
battery life what are you going to do

314
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,040
when the battery runs out

315
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,160
but there's been laboratory

316
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,200
uh tests on on these particular cells

317
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,959
and and those tests have either been

318
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,560
published or found and put up and um

319
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,760
the these cells are rated at 4 600

320
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,320
cycles in average

321
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,680
uh usage but but 100 depth of discharge

322
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,079
which is the worst case uh it puts the

323
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,600
most stress on the cells going from

324
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
completely fully charged to completely

325
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,839
empty

326
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,480
um so that's four thousand six hundred

327
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
cycles until it's eighty percent

328
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,600
depleted in

329
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,200
usefulness at which point it's

330
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,639
considered end of life even though it

331
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,079
still would have a

332
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:56,880
um a huge uh life after that and

333
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
the i3 that the battery came from could

334
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,639
do a quoted 125 miles per full charge

335
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:04,160
and if you multiply those together you

336
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,200
get an expected life of

337
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,600
575 000 miles which is way in excess

338
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,000
of the average life of most vehicles

339
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,680
these days

340
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
within the original battery pack there

341
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,600
was a very simple heating to prevent

342
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,720
frost

343
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,360
and and then there was quite a complex

344
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,519
hvac

345
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,120
air conditioning

346
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,160
type

347
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,240
chiller in there to stop the batteries

348
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,760
from getting too hot

349
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,959
um

350
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,160
this is incredibly difficult to

351
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,920
reproduce especially on a small vehicle

352
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,360
like a motorcycle

353
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,959
so i'm going down the path of saying the

354
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
uk is not an extreme climate we're not

355
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:41,760
desert we're not the arctic it's kind of

356
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,920
damp and horrible the whole time

357
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,279
especially today and

358
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:50,240
i'm not really expecting the

359
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,000
the very narrow operating zone to be

360
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,720
exceeded in normal use and if it does um

361
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,920
i i can just avoid the

362
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,000
the extreme power that they can't supply

363
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,839
and i'll avoid rapid charging in those

364
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:05,040
conditions which shouldn't be too

365
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,279
uh too difficult to do and too much of a

366
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:08,639
hindrance

367
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,160
um

368
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,360
the

369
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,600
i say the project is largely uncomplete

370
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,120
but these are the batteries stacked up

371
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,720
and i've got six

372
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,480
in two rows of three with the other two

373
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,200
on top which forms like a low

374
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,519
rectangular format so i'm going to be

375
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,240
building a battery box around those

376
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,440
and then building a girder frame

377
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,639
around

378
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,800
around the battery box

379
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,480
just behind it you can see the motor and

380
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,600
then i've got a wheel on there

381
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,320
pretending to be a seat just trying to

382
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,839
lay things out um

383
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:44,480
i've covered this when i was looking at

384
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,160
the battery so most battery packs have

385
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,160
the built-in

386
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,519
battery management systems it's been

387
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,760
hacked the other interesting thing is is

388
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,760
quite recently there's a company called

389
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,240
zephyr with australian company and

390
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,270
they've been making

391
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,440
[Music]

392
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
battery management systems for large

393
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,399
electric vehicles

394
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:03,920
which is quite special you can't use the

395
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,720
sort of thing you'd use on a model

396
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,160
the radio controlled model because

397
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,399
you're talking voltages three four

398
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
hundred volts as as nominal

399
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,880
and it has to be isolated and everything

400
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:18,160
else and and this company made

401
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,240
battery management systems for

402
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,320
kit builders

403
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,079
and they've been doing it for 14 years i

404
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,760
think they're quite respected and the

405
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,120
reason i mentioned them here is they

406
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,600
went out of business last autumn

407
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,880
which is not the sort of thing you want

408
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,279
to um announce but they've kept their

409
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,639
website open they put a little bit of

410
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,720
blurb in there and they've kept their

411
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,560
catalog and everything open but instead

412
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:41,600
of clicking on the the buy now cart

413
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
it links to a zip file and in the zip

414
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,760
file you get circuit diagrams go but

415
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,079
source code

416
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
the hex file to upload straight to the

417
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,720
the the micro and they even got stls for

418
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,240
3d printing your own cases and

419
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,600
enclosures which i thought was an

420
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,440
amazing gesture from a company who

421
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,959
decided not to operate anymore

422
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,680
on the motor

423
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,720
again there's many motors available

424
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,720
i've chosen a

425
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,399
mitsubishi outlander motor which is the

426
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:13,279
one pictured um

427
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,760
but there's there's other ones like leaf

428
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,279
prius uh

429
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:18,800
the lexus rear motor which is a

430
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,199
transaction like this uh the

431
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:22,959
outlander

432
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,320
switcher outlander which is this which

433
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,399
is a is a motor gearbox i don't know if

434
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,279
you can see on there you've got the

435
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
motor on one side and then the gearbox

436
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,519
and then and then there's the two

437
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,800
ports you can't see because they're side

438
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
on that the axles will go straight out

439
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,600
to the wheels

440
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,360
so you know if you were converting a car

441
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,560
you'd put one of these where the engine

442
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,360
was connect your shafts up and and that

443
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,800
would be your drive system it's very

444
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
simple and of course everyone loves the

445
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,279
tesla so i put those in there as well

446
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,020
and

447
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:49,519
[Music]

448
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:51,759
basically any ev or hybrid has the motor

449
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,800
in it

450
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,639
they're all much the same they're all

451
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,720
what you call embedded permanent magnet

452
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,680
motors

453
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,920
um a quick

454
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,160
a quick uh picture of that in a minute

455
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,120
and

456
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,600
the commutation is determined by

457
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,160
something called a a resolver at the end

458
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,759
of the motor that measures the absolute

459
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:11,759
shaft position for generating the

460
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
rotating magnetic field for

461
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,079
things like field oriented control motor

462
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:17,360
control

463
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:18,880
for those that don't know

464
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,600
what uh an embedded

465
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,000
permanent magnum motor is is is on the

466
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,920
left you've got a conventional motor

467
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
with the magnets around the outside of

468
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,279
it and then on an embedded permanent

469
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,440
magnum motor the magnets are embedded

470
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,519
within the iron core

471
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,800
of the laminated core and that um

472
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,720
i think allows it to spin a lot faster

473
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,720
because they're locked within a steel

474
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:43,040
including steel cage and it also allows

475
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,880
the motor to act as a permanent magnet

476
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,759
motor as well as at certain modes as a

477
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,199
various um

478
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,680
in induction motor as well

479
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,959
the

480
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:56,320
the resolver so i want to go over time

481
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,519
is

482
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,680
looks complex is this weird looking

483
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,920
thing on the left and what that is is a

484
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,400
inductively coupled position sensor

485
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,720
and in in the middle there's three coils

486
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,039
what you energize one coil and then as

487
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:11,280
the magnets uh the not the magnets on

488
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,359
the motor but a second pickup magnet or

489
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,640
is it core

490
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,559
uh iron core sorry it's an iron coil so

491
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,039
you'd like to be coupled as that rotates

492
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:20,799
you get different peaks that are 90

493
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,240
degrees out of phase on the other two

494
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,760
cores

495
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,720
and

496
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
and when you resolve those two and add

497
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
them up you get the shaft position

498
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,480
and that's an instantaneous non-contact

499
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,880
very durable uh device it's made of

500
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,640
cords or bar and bits of steel that's

501
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:41,120
not going to go wrong um you you hope um

502
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,240
and

503
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
again the reason i mention that is

504
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:46,160
almost every electric vehicle has one in

505
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,760
as part of the motor

506
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,200
and normally

507
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,880
there would be a very expensive

508
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,200
dedicated um

509
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,080
chip

510
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,280
that

511
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,039
that performs this

512
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,880
this function of energizing the coil and

513
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
then getting the shaft position out

514
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,360
but the guys in the open inverter forum

515
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
have

516
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
worked out that you can energize it with

517
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,440
the output from a microprocessor such as

518
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,320
an stm32 which is their choice

519
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,240
with an op-amp buffer and then you can

520
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,320
read the inputs with an analog input and

521
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,480
do the job in software so

522
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,520
you know

523
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
that costs a couple of pounds worth of

524
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,559
components uh and

525
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,160
easy

526
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,480
uh the

527
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,480
uh the the motor i've chosen again is

528
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,960
the outlander motor it's a 70 uh

529
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,919
kilowatt maximum peak it's got 195

530
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,200
newton meters of torque which is

531
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,440
monstrous and it weighs 40 kilos which

532
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,760
is chunky but not out of this world and

533
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,200
you can get them

534
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,960
in in scrap price two to four hundred

535
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:48,160
pounds uh relatively regularly obviously

536
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,320
those idiots out there who want

537
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,240
ten times that much but you know if you

538
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,440
if you

539
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,039
get a real breaker who's got actual

540
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,960
stock turnover

541
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,360
they're selling them a lot lower um

542
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,880
and there's people that reckon you can

543
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,080
get

544
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
sort of 50

545
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,120
more

546
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,520
on top of those figures for very short

547
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,280
durations

548
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,520
so that's um

549
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,919
that should be quite exciting

550
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,080
how i solve my transmission problems is

551
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,559
is on on the left hand side is the motor

552
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,559
and the right hand side there is is the

553
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,919
um

554
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:23,520
is the gearbox i've chosen and i've

555
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,280
chosen the bmw motorbike gearbox because

556
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,200
it fits the format of what i'm doing and

557
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,440
i've made a coupling using the insides

558
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,360
of two clutches one clutch from the

559
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,520
original gearbox and the other clutch

560
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,120
plate um

561
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,360
was found by by members of the opening

562
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,440
inverter community who found a clutch

563
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,520
that fitted the spline output of the

564
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,880
motor

565
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,240
because if you've ever walked into an

566
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,520
engineering workshop and said i want a

567
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,120
couple of made with whoops a couple of

568
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,679
slides on it um splines on it it gets

569
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:51,039
quite expensive and then when you say

570
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,360
it's automotive they get disinterested

571
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
and go oh no there's another loon uh

572
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,640
coming to our workshop

573
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,160
but i made this up for the cost of two

574
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,559
clutch plates a lump of aluminium and an

575
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
evening on on a lathe building up a

576
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,480
central boss to bolt the two halves to

577
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,000
and then i simply cut off the outside

578
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,159
with a with a grinder

579
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:12,480
um i then made two

580
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,799
uh flange plates with some cardboard

581
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,080
aided design

582
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,919
uh which is about the level i work out i

583
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
should learn some proper cad but i'd

584
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,600
never get around to it but i like this

585
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,280
method anyway

586
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,600
and that's my

587
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,480
um

588
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:29,200
transmission unit assembled and and

589
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:33,280
ready to go which i think is quite neat

590
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,360
the thing i had to do

591
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,880
that was quite technical is get the two

592
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:39,120
shafts aligned because if they're out of

593
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,840
alignment you get a lot of of wear on on

594
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,159
the clutch blinds which i've seen as i

595
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,440
mentioned in the previous life when i

596
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,600
was helping a guy mend and repair

597
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,760
homegrown conversions so so that was

598
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:55,679
that was it but the thing that the whole

599
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,159
presentation kind of hinges around

600
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,039
is

601
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,640
the inverter

602
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,159
and there's many choices because many

603
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:03,679
electric vehicles have inverters i've

604
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,640
got a list there of some i've chosen the

605
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,120
price for various reasons uh partly

606
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,559
because they're very cheap the scrap

607
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:14,320
price is about 200 pounds the

608
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:17,360
is it auras there um

609
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,360
there's the other hybrid that pro that

610
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,559
toyo to do

611
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,000
that's

612
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,440
um

613
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:25,679
less less salt over so you can get an

614
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:27,200
almost identical inverter for about a

615
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:28,880
hundred pounds

616
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,320
um and

617
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:33,919
the

618
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,679
approach the open inverter four are

619
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,159
using is is is they've realized that the

620
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,280
inverters are in three distinct layers

621
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,919
you've got the power components these

622
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:45,600
are the high voltage height current uh

623
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,200
transistors the power converters the

624
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,360
rgbts and they'll be smoothing

625
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
capacitors as well then there's the

626
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
middle layer which is the power

627
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:54,320
power

628
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,720
power component control which has very

629
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,400
fast switching edges so you get very

630
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,520
very little losses in your rgbts and

631
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,039
your overload protection so it doesn't

632
00:22:03,039 --> 00:22:05,120
explode you got shoot through protection

633
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,360
because um i'll explain that on the next

634
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,679
slide um

635
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,120
it has to have you know it has to be

636
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,440
controlled from low voltage which is you

637
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,120
should say the car side

638
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,880
controlling the high voltage side and

639
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,039
you need good isolation from that

640
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,400
because

641
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,320
you can't have 400 volts flows floating

642
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,000
around the vehicle and then on the top

643
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,080
i've referred this to as the brain bits

644
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,520
and that's there to communicate with the

645
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,919
rest of the vehicle it's there for

646
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:31,520
reading the motor resolver for the shaft

647
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,120
position which is

648
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:35,679
uh important functional part and it's

649
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,520
for producing the switching sequences on

650
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,039
the output that result in the rotating

651
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,400
magnetic field and motor spin

652
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:46,400
um i have to speed up a bit the

653
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:50,799
so so this is a schematic of the the

654
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:52,640
should we say the power side it's very

655
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:56,159
simplified but you can see there's two

656
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,320
the the two grain gray modules are two

657
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,039
three phase power stages therefore in

658
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,320
the price

659
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,720
it has a two motors it has a moto g

660
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,159
motor generator one and a motor

661
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,080
generator two and they speed in

662
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
opposition to generate all the motor

663
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,880
forward and reverse

664
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:14,640
movement and that's that's a subject in

665
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,600
itself

666
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:16,640
but

667
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,720
you get those and then on on the the

668
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,919
left in the yellow part you've got a

669
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,280
boost buck

670
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,720
controller

671
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,880
and that converts the battery voltage

672
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,720
into the high voltage bus

673
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,400
uh so so that can

674
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,720
so the battery is about normally 250

675
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,200
volts the bus voltage can go up to over

676
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,280
600 volts not that it ever goes there

677
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,919
much but we've got this device within it

678
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,840
um

679
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,279
and if you flip

680
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:45,120
take it apart and flip it over

681
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,799
you you've presented with this the big

682
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,720
shiny thing

683
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,200
on the right-hand side of the the right

684
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,799
photo is the inductor for that power

685
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,799
converter and on the left-hand side is

686
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:55,520
the

687
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,880
um 12-volt or 14-volt uh

688
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,720
dc to dc converter for running the rest

689
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,919
of the vehicle the lights the heat of

690
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,120
the radio

691
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,000
heated seats and and yeah you know all

692
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,480
the other stuff like that um

693
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,000
and that's quite capable that's that's

694
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,880
like 120 amps or 14 volts so it's a very

695
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,880
useful bit of kit but when i joined the

696
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,400
open inverter form everyone was saying

697
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,679
oh no they say if i connect this to my

698
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:21,840
diy battery

699
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,799
um

700
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,400
it doesn't work because it's not within

701
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,440
the price battery range of 80 to 235

702
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,760
volts therefore we can't use it

703
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,440
and and there was all manner of talk

704
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,240
about that so what i did and this is my

705
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,640
input to the open source world in in

706
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,919
here and

707
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,679
it's all rather proud of it is i reverse

708
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,640
engineered the input stage of this

709
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,039
dc to dc converter and

710
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,480
worked out you could change the feedback

711
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,080
resistors

712
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,120
and then you could get it to cut out at

713
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,120
the voltage you wanted it to and i also

714
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,799
looked at the spec of the components of

715
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,440
that that part and

716
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,760
realize that the input to that can go as

717
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,600
high as the high voltage bus so you can

718
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,520
you can connect it to your four hole 400

719
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,720
volt battery and that's fine

720
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,279
and the actual hack is is how how do we

721
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,840
make it work for us

722
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,360
we've got all these protocols going on

723
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,400
and all these electric cars and and

724
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,080
to reverse engineer that is it's both

725
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,919
tedious and difficult and

726
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:24,159
it's proprietary knowledge so you won't

727
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,480
ever know if you've got it right so the

728
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,120
open inverter approach is to

729
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,880
remove the brain part that i just spoke

730
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,720
about is to just take that out to say

731
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:33,760
right we're not going to use that we're

732
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,440
going to use our own one and put our one

733
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,679
in and within the price converter

734
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,559
because

735
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:41,279
that particular one has got the distinct

736
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:43,840
layers are in distinct circuit boards is

737
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,279
you can pull one out

738
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,200
and put your own one in and on the right

739
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,840
hand side that is a

740
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,919
a board that's produced by one of the

741
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:54,000
guys on on the open inverter

742
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,240
you can get all the firmware for it and

743
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,240
design

744
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,480
files but he also sells them as well so

745
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,400
you can buy that as a

746
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,640
as an off-the-shelf thing take your

747
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:05,679
price

748
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,520
converter apart unplug a circuit board

749
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,919
plug that one back in put the lid on and

750
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:12,640
it's yours you you connect to your

751
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,799
battery management system

752
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:15,600
uh

753
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,600
control signals your your throttle your

754
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,600
brake pedal um

755
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,440
and and a few other things and and off

756
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,840
it will go it's also wi-fi enabled so

757
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:26,159
you configure it via a web page on on

758
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,960
your laptop um

759
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,400
it's briefly cover charging so i'm

760
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:32,799
running out of time um

761
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:35,679
i want an option on charging uh the the

762
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:37,760
ones available are ac charging which is

763
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,400
type 2 or socket in-house ccs dc

764
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,480
charging or should demo dc charging

765
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:45,039
which is falling out of favor um one way

766
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,720
is to use a pre-built module out of a

767
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,799
leafer and outlander and i believe

768
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,400
the controller those the control codes

769
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,919
for those the can canvas

770
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:53,760
signals are known so you can make those

771
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,000
work yourself

772
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:56,799
but

773
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,679
going back to that

774
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,080
that schematic i just put up if you look

775
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,320
at this

776
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,799
bug boost converter in itself that can

777
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:10,480
have 250 volts on one end and 600 volts

778
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:13,679
on the other so there is the

779
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:16,240
the potential to use that to charge your

780
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,159
battery straight off the mains

781
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,640
obviously it's a non-isolated charges

782
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,760
you have to be careful with your

783
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:23,200
insulation which you should be being

784
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:25,760
careful with um yourself

785
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,640
and

786
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,880
commercial views uh sorry

787
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,440
the other one is to use the motor as an

788
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
inductor in a voltage converter using

789
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
the the main car

790
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,919
inverter which is

791
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:39,919
something the the zoe uses i think which

792
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:41,840
is why when you hear a zoe when it

793
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,360
obviously see as zoe parked up and

794
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,279
charging it's quite noisy because it's

795
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,520
using the motor as a

796
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,120
uh an inductor and

797
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
and and that's obviously

798
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
uh producing some sound uh the

799
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,320
again coming back to the inverter forum

800
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
is the other way of doing it is to use

801
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,840
an existing

802
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,880
module which means to use an existing

803
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:05,760
module and

804
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,520
and and they've

805
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,919
picked for various reasons the bmw lim

806
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,640
module which is a

807
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,880
local integration module and

808
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
and that controls the protocol to the

809
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,080
ccs

810
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,850
charger which is a roadside charger and

811
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:25,889
[Music]

812
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,000
and the

813
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,640
the limb module takes

814
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,200
very simple or comparatively simple

815
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,279
can bus signals from the main car

816
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,640
controller

817
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,039
and then this limb module converts it

818
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,039
into the incredibly complicated

819
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,880
multi-layered multi-layers of

820
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,640
abstraction into the ccs charge and we

821
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,000
can control that

822
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:48,240
um

823
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,799
i i was going to talk about steering but

824
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:53,039
i've i've run out of time

825
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:54,960
um smaller things i was tracking chat

826
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,799
into the hackieverse hacky racers

827
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,720
earlier so i put some smaller converters

828
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,039
up so i've got honda ima converter bmw

829
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:03,360
i3 i3

830
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,799
charger inverter because the i3 has a

831
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,960
range extender engine in it and and then

832
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:09,120
i've put up a kia 10 kilowatt

833
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
motor alternator which is again it's not

834
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,679
an alternator as you'd imagine it it's a

835
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,440
three-phase motor with a resolver on it

836
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,799
and and then the power control is done

837
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:17,600
by

838
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,799
an inverter which is the one on the

839
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:23,200
extreme right um my closing notes are

840
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:24,720
i shouldn't have to say this but because

841
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:27,360
there's been uh

842
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,720
vocalization of this on the oprah

843
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,279
inverter forum is the developers are not

844
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,919
your your support line um don't contact

845
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:35,840
the well not don't contact them their

846
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,279
inboxes are full they're fed up so they

847
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,559
would rather and they voice this

848
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:40,000
themselves which is why i'm repeating it

849
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,520
they'd rather you went on the forums

850
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,760
because the forums are very active

851
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,320
i mean this is not a drop-in solution so

852
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:48,159
there's work it works but it's a work in

853
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,200
process

854
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,640
and

855
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,480
lastly

856
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,480
there should be a page of resources

857
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,000
so if you want to follow any of this up

858
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:56,960
you can

859
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,840
um

860
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,600
so

861
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,840
that concludes my presentation i've got

862
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:02,960
some stickers i want to give out

863
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,679
