1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,080
i've got half an hour not much time so 
yeah. Yet another railway safety talk - I  

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,280
think it's the third of four. I'm told this 
is known internally as the "railway track"

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,680
A bit about me: I'm a safety critical software 
engineer, so i've spent my career doing air  

4
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:19,200
traffic management, air traffic control, so 
that's the big radar screen that you see them  

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,640
use and train-borne ETRMS/ETCS equipment - there's 
a lot of acronyms, I will try and expand them all.  

6
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:30,640
So that is some equipment that goes on the train 
and it's on the driver's desk - I've got a picture  

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,000
later. Disclaimer: these are my views, not my 
employer's. So i think there's three key periods  

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:42,400
of time when want to talk about rail safety: 
there's up to 1890, and we'll cover why that, is  

9
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,000
the bit in the middle and then 1980 to the present 
day where we see the modern techniques that we use  

10
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:54,000
come in. I'm not covering covering signalling 
all that much - Robin Wilson did an excellent  

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
talk this morning on it. So hopefully there'll 
be a recording of that if you've not seen it.

12
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,360
So in the beginning, it really was like the wild 
west. The Liverpool and Manchester railway opened  

13
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,440
in 1830. On the opening day, the politician 
William Huskisson was killed. He wasn't  

14
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:19,120
the first person to die on the railway but, 
obviously it was a politician and this made the  

15
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:23,280
newspapers interested, and the day got even 
better. So the prime minister was on the train,  

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,400
he got pelted with vegetables when 
they arrived at Manchester because  

17
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,920
the people of Manchester were not happy with 
the tax policy of the time. So this all they  

18
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,840
all got into the press, people heard about 
these railways and and they really took off.  

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,080
Private experimental carriages were run. Charles 
Babbage was a good friend of Isambard Kingdom  

20
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:52,720
Brunel, and he had an experimental train 
with 30 tons of iron and he...at Paddington  

21
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,280
station and hears a train approaching, and 
says to the staff "well i can hear a train" 

22
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,520
"no no no it's fine, no train scheduled 
for the next few hours, you're fine" 

23
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,120
Brunel appears from said train and steps 
down having seen this engine at Bristol,  

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:13,760
summoned it and driven it 50 miles an 
hour myself. Babbage asks "so, supposing  

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,200
you came across another train on the same line?"
Brunel says he would have "put on all steam with  

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,799
a view to driving off the opposite engine 
by the superior velocity of his own."

27
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,040
[laughter]

28
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,000
Thankfully for mathematics and 
engineering, this didn't happen,  

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
but this is the sort of thing 
that was going on at the time.  

30
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,880
There were quite a few accidents, increasingly 
high-profile. The writer Charles Dickens  

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,480
was involved in a train crash and used his top 
hat to give people water and administered brandy.  

32
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,239
Brunel at a select committee hearing about 
regulating the railways said that railway men  

33
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:55,520
would "hopefully answer questions in a gentlemanly 
manner." Railway companies were very suspicious  

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:03:02,080
about the government interfering with them, but by 
1842 the Board of Trade could inspect the railways  

35
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,640
and prohibit them from opening if they thought 
they were unsafe, and they picked people from  

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,200
the Army Corps of Engineers for that because 
they were engineers and knew what they were doing  

37
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,440
and maybe because they were from the Army, 
the railway companies might listen to them.  

38
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,520
So, they formed Her Majesty's Railway 
Inspectorate. And things were improving  

39
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:26,240
for the passengers as well, by 1844 third class 
passengers should be provided with seats and  

40
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:34,960
be protected from the weather. Before then third 
class was effectively animal wagons so when sheep  

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:39,680
weren't being carried around they could they could 
carry passengers for a few pence, and obviously  

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,840
those wagons were made of wood and if there was a 
crash the third class passengers got it the worst.

43
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:50,320
By 1871, 30 years after it was created, the 
Railway Inspectorate finally got the power  

44
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:56,320
to interview people and seize evidence, but 
they couldn't force the railway companies to  

45
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:02,160
do anything - they could just harrumph a lot and 
suggest things. Here's a picture of the first one,  

46
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:06,240
so this being Victorian they're all heavily 
mustachioed and they've gone for a windswept  

47
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:13,040
look here reflecting his army background. So 
what were they investigating? There's some really  

48
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:22,240
shocking stuff. At Round Oak in 1858, an excursion 
train carrying hundreds of people was on its way  

49
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,000
and the guard was smoking and drinking and 
letting passengers experiment with the brake.  

50
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,400
In those days carriages didn't have brakes 
themselves - you had brake vans along the  

51
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,200
train with a big real handbrake you wound on and 
the carriages linked together with chain couplings  

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:42,479
so there's one in the middle and two on the 
side, and these kept breaking and snapping  

53
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,760
because they were fiddling with the brake 
and they'd stop and repair them and carry on.

54
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,480
Except on the way back, these couplings finally 
broke and the train, which didn't have any brakes,  

55
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:56,880
ran away and crashed. Quite a few people 
died. The guard claimed to say the brake  

56
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,760
was faulty - they found a bit of the brake and 
it wasn't, and yeah, it was not good for him.

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:09,680
And then on the engineering side, the Tay Bridge 
disaster in 1879. So this was a dark and stormy  

58
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,800
night in Scotland and the train leaves Burntisland 
station next to the Tay bridge and disappears in a  

59
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,520
flash of light. This was due to wind loading - the 
construction of the bridge, they hadn't accounted  

60
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
for high winds and the combination of the high 
winds and the weight of the train made the bridge  

61
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,640
collapse and the quality of the building was 
pretty poor as well and the career of its engineer  

62
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,520
was ruined and it also killed 75 people at least. 
The Railway Inspectorate actually had some trouble  

63
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,560
here so the railway companies were harrumphing 
saying "well they don't know about trains,  

64
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,320
why should we listen to them?" but they did 
know an awful lot about bridges so there was  

65
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,520
a problem for them there. But the result was 
that everything else was heavilyover engineered  

66
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,240
which is why you see a lot of this Victorian 
rail infrastructure still here today.

67
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:02,720
That's a quick picture of it.

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,480
So a thing which really changed things was the 
Armargh disaster - so Robin covered a couple of  

69
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,640
these earlier. The Railway Inspectorate had 
been arguing for decades about the railway  

70
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:18,719
companies should adopt "lock, block and brake." So 
"lock" is full mechanical interlocking of signals  

71
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:23,520
so the signals can't signal conflicting 
movements - that's where a train could be  

72
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,479
directed at another one and a number of other 
things. "Block," the absolute block system,  

73
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:35,840
so the railway track is divided into blocks and 
a train may only be in one block at any one time.  

74
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:43,760
And continuous brakes, so this is a brake pipe 
that runs the length of the train and if the  

75
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,719
train divides for any reason the brakes gets 
applied and that's controlled from the engine.

76
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,159
So what happened in Armargh on the 
12th of June 1889? A big excursion  

77
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:59,920
train full of Sunday school children leaves 
Armargh station in what is now Northern Ireland.  

78
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,240
There's a steep hill hill to climb, and the driver 
wants an assisting locomotive provided because  

79
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,600
he thinks his might not make it, and it's refused. 
The station master at Armargh effectively said  

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:17,120
"drivers don't complain about excursion 
trains here, get on with it." But they  

81
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,400
decide the following train can assist if needed 
and give it a push. As Robin said this morning,  

82
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,960
at this time they use the time interval system so 
every 15 minutes they send a train out. They say,  

83
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:30,159
well if that happens then the next train 
along can give you a push up the hill.

84
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:39,599
The train does indeed stall and they decide 
to divide it. The train crew agree to put the  

85
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,880
handbrakes on the rear half of the train, take the 
other half over the summit and go back and collect  

86
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:50,000
the rest. So they start putting hand brakes 
on and use bits of rocks to chock the wheels.  

87
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:54,799
The handbrakes don't hold, it rolls back down 
the hill and then collides with the following  

88
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,120
train which under the time interval system 
had been sent on its way. This was pretty  

89
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,600
horrible - this killed 80 people, injured 200, 
and was the worst accident in the UK to date.  

90
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:11,360
I think because it was full of Sunday school 
children, it was a public outrage at the time and  

91
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,920
that led to a middle section. So the government 
finally intervened and the Regulation of Railways  

92
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:23,360
Act 1889 gave powers for the "lock, block and 
brake" that they'd been wanting so they could now  

93
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,840
command the railways to install these things. And 
things gradually improved, obviously accidents  

94
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,880
were bad for the railway companies they didn't 
want these accidents to happen - it was it was  

95
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,880
bad publicity and especially in the early 
days people might go back to the stagecoach.

96
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,959
Things were actually improving - 
there were technological advancements.  

97
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,400
World War One got in the way. So at 
Quintinshill, also mentioned this morning,  

98
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,840
a simple enough signal box - all of those three 
were there, and three passenger trains collided  

99
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,840
and killed 220 people, and it remains 
the worst accident in this country.  

100
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,800
But what's interesting is why did it happen? 
It was arguably negligence from the signallers  

101
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,839
for not following their processes but it was 
also wartime so what do you what do you make of  

102
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:15,840
that? There are too many people in the signal box 
because the newspaper had just arrived and they  

103
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:24,720
were discussing news about the war. Everyone was 
working long hours. The guard was hanging around.  

104
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,720
It's a lot more difficult than just saying the 
signaller was negligent. That is part of it.

105
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,520
The Second World War comes along and the big four 
railway companies in the middle on this on this  

106
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:44,480
diagram were effectively ruined. The rail network 
was was worn out. So British Railways was formed  

107
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:53,840
and this helped hold the network together. So 
in terms of safety, what's happening right now,  

108
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,040
the Great Western Railway was experimenting with 
Automatic Train Control. This became the Automatic  

109
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,599
Warning System that Robin talked about from 
1906. This is some equipment on the track that  

110
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:11,840
detects when a signal is not at green and sounds a 
warning bell. And we're also starting to mitigate  

111
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,760
the effects of accidents - trying to work out, 
if there is an accident how do we make it less  

112
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,680
severe? So, removal of gas lighting in coaches, 
and coaches that had a lot of wooden bodies.  

113
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:29,760
So a nasty one here was Harrow and Wealdstone 
- again, signals not being followed  

114
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,480
but the key was that this Mark One coach that 
British Rail have come out with was all steel,  

115
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,720
had much better couplings, and survived 
the crash a lot better so we're starting  

116
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,560
to understand how the construction 
of carriages can can help save lives.  

117
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,680
And also that signallers have had this 
interlocking absolute block system for  

118
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
coming up to 100 years by this point, but 
there was nothing much for the drivers,  

119
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:56,480
so that's where the automatic warning system 
came in and the inquiry into this one said that 

120
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,840
"Enginemen should be given their share 
of technical aids to safe working" 

121
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,200
And they suggested that the AWS be 
rolled out across across the network.

122
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,280
Again, gradual improvements up to 1980, but I 
think here's where we get modern safety coming in.  

123
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:21,199
So, the "Swiss Cheese" theory was mentioned 
at the Boat vs Rig talk yesterday as well.  

124
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,240
If you imagine a piece of Swiss 
cheese, it's got some holes in.  

125
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,880
Some of the holes stop before they get to the 
other side and some go all the way through and  

126
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:37,920
in this theory if you can see all the way through 
the cheese, that's some accident that happens.  

127
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,560
And the thicker the cheese, or the more 
layers you have, the fewer through holes.  

128
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,880
So you want to you want to make 
your cheese as thick as possible.

129
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:55,520
And this comes into, what if we assume accidents 
will happen? If we assume that, then we work out  

130
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:00,640
how we're going to mitigate them. So we can reduce 
the chances of accidents occurring to begin with,  

131
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:09,839
this is known as ALARP or "as 
low as reasonably practicable."

132
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:17,760
So what this means is you need to 
consider things like, cost is a factor,  

133
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:23,840
complexity. So there's a theory that 
if you add too many redundancies  

134
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,199
that will actually increase the chance 
of an accident occurring as the system's  

135
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,680
so complex. I think that's one of the theories 
behind Three Mile Island, the nuclear accident  

136
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,479
in in the United States. So you also want 
to reduce the consequences of an accident,  

137
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:46,960
as we said about new coach designs, and all this 
can be known as "defence in depth" and this is  

138
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,840
also followed by quite a few industries, 
I think IT security talk about this a lot.

139
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,240
But what about the people? So we're 
all human and we make mistakes,  

140
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:06,000
and fatigue tiredness, frustration, this has been 
known about for a long time as well. If people  

141
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:12,000
are working working too late or exhausted, they 
make mistakes. People can also be quite foolish.  

142
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,680
So in 1972 the driver of an excursion train 
drove his train to, i think, Margate, and then  

143
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:23,280
drank several pints of mild ale and then some 
brandy. He was just a little bit over the limit  

144
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,200
and he misread his signals - crash. 
Maybe we've learned some lessons.  

145
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,560
20 years later at Cannon Street in London, 
driver is suspected to be under the influence  

146
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:41,680
of cannabis. He wasn't tested until several 
days after the event. Again, fails to brake,  

147
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:47,760
crashes into buffers. Hundreds of injuries here - 
this was a packed commuter train and everyone was  

148
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:53,760
stood up getting ready to leave. A lot of the 
injuries were caused by very old coaches - the  

149
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:01,840
Southern Railway were in the habit of reusing 
coach under frames and these dated from the 1920s.

150
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:06,160
What happens here? We have a lot 
more drug and alcohol testing,  

151
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:13,360
the old coaches get withdrawn, but the drug and 
alcohol thing is really - this was 30 years ago  

152
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:19,920
and back then it was considered quite common, if 
you had a few hours break, drivers could go off to  

153
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,680
the railway club, have a few pints of bitter and 
a sandwich and then go back again. And then this  

154
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,319
in 1991 was a step change. It's now completely 
zero tolerance on alcohol as you might imagine.

155
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:40,880
A bit more recent, Wootton Bassett in 2015, a 
driver deliberately isolates his AWS - that we've  

156
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:47,520
talked about quite a bit now - and goes past a 
signal at red and narrowly avoids really quite  

157
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:55,199
a nasty collision with a passenger train. Steam 
trains have to have exactly the same systems as  

158
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,320
any other one if they're on the national 
network so that includes black box recorders and  

159
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:04,480
and all of that. And the RAIB - more about 
them later, Rail Accident Investigation  

160
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,400
Branch - find that the behaviour has almost 
certainly become an accepted practice  

161
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,760
among some train crews. We'll discuss about 
that one later so this is saying the driver's  

162
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:18,880
done something monumentally stupid there, why did 
he do that? We'll think about that in a moment.

163
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,600
In the early 1990s we had privatisation, so 
British Rail was split up into lots of different  

164
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:37,040
parts. It's split into Railtrack who owned the 
infrastructure. The allegation is made that  

165
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,120
Railtrack viewed themselves as a property company 
that happens to have trains on their property.  

166
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:49,920
The ROSCOs are the rolling stock owners 
so they own the trains. The TOCs and FOCs,  

167
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,400
the Train Operating Companies and the Freight 
Operating Companies: they run the trains so that's  

168
00:15:54,400 --> 00:16:01,520
things like Great Western Railway, Northern, 
Transport for London. And lots and lots and  

169
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:07,840
lots of contractors, and as we'll see it was 
becoming quite tricky to keep track of them all.  

170
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:17,040
So this was the early to mid 1990s and things 
ran okay for a few years. I should also say, that  

171
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:24,640
Mark 1 coach that in the 1950s was heralded as 
a brand new design - very safe - 40 years later,  

172
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,640
it was now outdated. A number of accidents 
around this time, especially Cannon Street  

173
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:35,840
as in the in the last slide. It wasn't coming 
across too well and it started to be withdrawn.

174
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:44,240
The wheels come off for privatization with I think 
three key accidents: In 1997, the Southall crash,  

175
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,600
again a signal passed at red and the Automatic 
Warning System was defective. So this is something  

176
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:56,960
that 50 years ago they said should be mandatory 
and rolled out to all lines - it was defective  

177
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:05,200
and no one seemed in a particular rush to fix it. 
However there was a brand new protection system  

178
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,960
installed on the train and the track - it wasn't 
in use and there was a report going on at the  

179
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,400
time to decide whether they should actually scrap 
the whole thing because it was costing too much  

180
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:18,959
and all these newly privatised companies 
couldn't agree on who should fix things,  

181
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,839
so if the AWS was defective, if it's on the train 
is that the owner of the train who fixes it?  

182
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,000
Is it the people that run the train? Everyone 
argued about this and nothing actually got done.  

183
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,880
However in this accident the Mark 3 
coaches - a newer design - they were  

184
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:41,280
praised for their crashworthiness 
- more about that later.

185
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:48,160
In terms of Railtrack: in 2000 a piece of 
track disintegrated underneath the train  

186
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:53,760
from metal fatigue and the train derailed and 
I think some six or seven people died there.  

187
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:57,840
Railtrack admitted they didn't actually 
know where any other defects could be,  

188
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:04,240
and the entire network had speed restrictions 
for the best part of a year. You might well  

189
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,400
remember that, it was a pretty bad year.

190
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:12,640
Similarly in 2002 there was another derailment 
where a train derailed in a platform and ended  

191
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:19,120
up wedged between the platform and the 
roof. It's an interesting picture and  

192
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:22,560
the competence of the contractor there was 
really dubious. The contractor actually tried  

193
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:30,960
to accuse persons unknown of sabotage, which 
wasn't true. The really interesting one - and  

194
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,040
you could do a whole talk on this itself - is 
Ladbroke Grove, again mentioned this morning.  

195
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:42,240
A whole load of things are wrong with the 
industry here. The driver training wasn't good,  

196
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,840
the signalling scheme wasn't fully inspected, the 
train protection rollout system was very slow. So  

197
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,800
by this time, they decided that they really ought 
to do something but nothing had happened yet.

198
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,280
I think the three of these combined really 
was a shock to the industry. So what happened?  

199
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:07,040
The Rail Accident Investigation Branch was 
formed on the first thing, so this came out of  

200
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:10,960
Southall and Ladbroke Grove. One of the issues 
there was Her Majesty's Railway Inspectorate,  

201
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,960
who had been around for well over 150 
years now, there was a bias problem.  

202
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,240
Because they were having to investigate 
their own department there was a an issue  

203
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,440
there of - you know, if they agreed to 
this Signalling scheme at Ladbroke Grove,  

204
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:33,600
which was a bit dodgy. So the Rail Accident 
Investigation Branch were formed to mitigate that.  

205
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,440
And they're obliged to investigate incidents 
causing death or serious injury and also anything  

206
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,360
where, if the circumstances were slightly 
different, could have caused the same. The  

207
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,520
key thing is they don't apportion blame - this is 
this is hard to describe so i'll try my very best.

208
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:58,320
So going back to that steam train in in 2015 where 
the driver isolated his safety systems - why did  

209
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:05,840
the driver do that? So the report found that 
there was a culture in the company involved  

210
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:14,560
which meant this sort of thing was tolerated 
as long as you didn't tell anyone. If it  

211
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,200
causes delays to disappear so the 
the system was isolated. Of course  

212
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,080
the driver forgot to cancel the warning system 
and that put the brakes on, and there's a 60  

213
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,120
second delay before you can release them so he 
didn't want to have to explain why he was late.  

214
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:35,679
So it was understanding why 
the driver took that decision.

215
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:43,840
There was another really interesting one from 
two years ago involving Covid where on the  

216
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:52,000
night Boris Johnson in this country announced 
a national lockdown, a train driver was worried  

217
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:57,600
about childcare for his daughter and 
this caused him to lose concentration and  

218
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:02,560
derail his train. And that's not blaming 
the driver, that's understanding the  

219
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:08,800
context in which people are in a very stressful 
situation and many any other outside influences.  

220
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:15,520
What else happened around this sort of time? 
Network Rail was created because Railtrack  

221
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:19,840
basically went bankrupt and Network Rail was 
created because it was eventually decided that  

222
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,560
a company responsible for safety probably 
shouldn't be paying out shareholder dividends.  

223
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:33,600
The Train Protection and Warning System was rolled 
out - so they decided that a nationwide rollout of  

224
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,160
a really good speed supervision, 
signal supervision system - that  

225
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:42,400
would be ideal but it was far too expensive, 
very complex and would take a very long time,  

226
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,440
whereas the train protection and warning 
system is a bit more simple - it does similar  

227
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,560
things - it stops trains from speeding in certain 
situations and going past stop signals, but it  

228
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,879
was a lot cheaper and it was also a lot faster 
to roll out because it could be retrofitted.

229
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:10,000
So that's where we are, that's the 
state of things from the mid 2000s.  

230
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,000
Where are we now? Computers 
will fix everything right?  

231
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,159
We can automate a lot of these signalling 
problems, away all these confusions about  

232
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:29,440
obeying signals. On the Cambrian Line in Wales you 
have what's known as ETCS, so the European Train  

233
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:38,480
Control System. The train communicates with the 
signalling centre over radio and reads data from  

234
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:44,160
the track and this is displayed on a display in 
the driver's cab - I've got a picture coming up.  

235
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,320
One day in 2017 a driver spots that a 
speed restriction that's been there for  

236
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:54,000
several years isn't there anymore 
and the signaller says that it is  

237
00:22:54,000 --> 00:23:00,960
there. So something's gone wrong here. Here's a 
picture of the screen, so this is showing a train  

238
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:07,840
traveling at 39 kilometres per hour and there's 
a speed limit of about 95 kilometres per hour.

239
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,240
So something went badly wrong here and it was 
ultimately a database corruption error. There  

240
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:23,920
was a single point of failure in this software 
system and it took the software vendor months  

241
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:31,280
to reproduce the issue in their lab and this 
is a bit concerning because software safety  

242
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:36,879
and software quality is taken extremely seriously 
in the industry. So from personal experience from  

243
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:43,280
writing code to it actually going into service 
takes about a year. So something went seriously  

244
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:52,720
wrong here and the consequence from this is a lot 
closer look at software standards in the industry.

245
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,560
Never mind, so if we check our work more, 
software whatever, that'll be okay? So  

246
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:07,280
this this one was a couple of years ago. I was 
thinking about doing a talk like this at EMF 2020  

247
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:13,120
which didn't happen but I could 
have said then that the last fatal  

248
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:19,840
passenger development was in this country 
was 2007 - that was at Grayrigg in Cumbria.  

249
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:26,879
That's a really good safety record for this 
country and um the network in this country  

250
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:31,840
i think is the most reliable in Europe - the 
safest in Europe, if not the world actually.

251
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:42,360
Well let's look at Carmont in 2020, so after a 
period of very heavy weather, very heavy rain, a  

252
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:49,040
train comes along, there's some debris on the 
track and it derails and goes down the hill and  

253
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:56,240
catches fire. Three people died at this crash very 
sadly. This was a rush hour train, if it had been  

254
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,720
busier - which it wasn't because of Covid, there 
were about 10 people on board - it would have been  

255
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:10,399
really terrible. The ultimate cause was a drain 
that was trying to drain water from a field above  

256
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:18,000
the railway - to stop the railway flooding - was 
incorrectly constructed. The diagram just wasn't  

257
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:25,040
followed so unfortunately this goes back to Tay 
Bridge 150 years earlier - poor construction.  

258
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,560
I think the specifications were okay but it was 
never inspected. Once this drain was built it  

259
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,560
should have been entered onto a computer system 
and that would have set a schedule of regular  

260
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:43,280
inspections that just never happened. 
No one knew it was there. The signalling  

261
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:49,360
centre or the control room at ScotRail had a very 
comprehensive weather system that told them about  

262
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:55,040
rainstorms but no one had been trained on the 
advanced features of it so it wasn't being  

263
00:25:55,040 --> 00:26:02,800
used to its full extent. And the Mark 3 cabbage 
that 20 years ago was shown to be excellent and  

264
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:10,720
crash worthy was now seen - actually it's got 
some problems. So what can we take from that?

265
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:19,760
It's that nothing's staying the same 
here. Everything - things move slowly  

266
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:26,400
in the rail industry - so decades rather 
than months or years, but they're always  

267
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:29,600
looking for improvements and 
then recognising, actually  

268
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:32,560
this is this has been around a long 
time it's time it's time to retire it.

269
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:41,600
Where can you read more if you're interested in 
sort of stuff? The Rail Accident Investigation  

270
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,800
Branch, so their reports are really 
human-readable. They have a good glossary,  

271
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:54,879
they explain all the railway terms that are not 
obvious. If you're interested in this sort of  

272
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:02,240
thing I really would pick a few out. The one 
at Carmont is interesting and the one about  

273
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,640
safety culture for the steam train 
at Wooton Basset is quite good as  

274
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,200
well. Railways archive covers everything before 
then and also has some good cross-referencing.  

275
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,200
For readings, Red for Danger is a book that covers 
basically up to the formation of British Rail.  

276
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,400
It's a bit technical but it's pretty 
readable, if a bit depressing.  

277
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,040
Normal Accidents by Charles Perrow, so 
this talks about the Swiss Cheese model  

278
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:37,760
and the theory that if you make a system so 
complex, accidents are just going to happen  

279
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:44,320
by the laws of probability so it's best to 
try and design to mitigate the consequences.

280
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,840
So

281
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:58,400
Conclusions: it's been 180 years now, 
and we're still learning. We're still  

282
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,720
learning lessons. I think in my opinion 
sometimes we're a bit too proactive  

283
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,000
so you know we need to be more proactive. 
Accidents happen and we think oh why did they  

284
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,760
happen and stop them happening again i think 
we need to be a bit more on the other side of  

285
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,040
thinking where accidents could happen. 
This does happen in the software industry.  

286
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,560
Other than that that's everything. I've got some 
notes and references to some of the accidents i've  

287
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:29,840
talked about here if you want to read more on 
them, contact me there and thank you very much!
