1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,280
so

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:04,960
before we start i have to make you aware

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,319
that everything up here is covered in

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,440
spiders

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,440
absolutely everything and it's really

6
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,200
uncomfortable but there's actually one

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,880
attached to me right now this is very

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,160
anyway so

9
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,759
uh if you are going to speak here later

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,440
today i'm very sorry it's all spiders

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,279
anyway welcome to electromagnetic

12
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,759
electromagnetic field 2022. uh

13
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,359
i know we normally run it yet late but

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,599
two years is a new record for us so i'm

15
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,079
very sorry about that it's really weird

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,160
to be stood here again um this is the

17
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,000
most people i've seen in a couple of

18
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,920
years now but thank you all for coming

19
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,879
back

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:41,840
um

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,120
i don't know how many people have been

22
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,399
here before but

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:45,840
i know this is

24
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,399
been an interesting event for us um

25
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,600
we'll sort of

26
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,320
we'll get into it but this year is 10

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,960
years since we started doing this

28
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,960
um

29
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:04,799
and for those who don't know this was

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,040
never intended to happen we didn't

31
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,040
intend to have a festival this big

32
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,640
um we intended to go camping for a

33
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,720
weekend and things got wildly out of

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,039
hand

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
i'm really surprised that this is still

36
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,720
going to be honest so

37
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,400
thank you for coming back

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,479
just because it's interesting for me how

39
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:23,600
many people

40
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,840
came to emf 2012 in the audience can you

41
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
please raise your hand

42
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,199
that's quite a lot

43
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,439
so there are only only i think 400

44
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:36,000
people at that so this is a surprising

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,240
number and who is attending gamer for

46
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,479
the very first time

47
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:40,910
wow

48
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,920
[Applause]

49
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,280
interesting

50
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,040
probably more for you than me but yeah

51
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,399
very interesting

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,159
and just for a final one who has been to

53
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,960
every single emf event

54
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,119
and i'm gonna

55
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:56,079
oh yeah

56
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,240
okay

57
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
i'm gonna include electromagnetic wave

58
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
owners as well how many people went to

59
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,880
that one as well

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,080
it's the same people okay

61
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,919
we're calling you the true fans keep

62
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:11,599
coming back so

63
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,120
thank you for coming back as well uh

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,720
those people will know all the trials

65
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,920
and tribulations we've been through over

66
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
the years uh and if you get them drunk

67
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,959
in the bar i'm sure they'll tell you

68
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,080
about some of the terrible things we've

69
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,400
done as well that we won't do again

70
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,640
so

71
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,840
obviously we had to cancel mf 2020 uh

72
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,280
which we weren't happy about we'd spent

73
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,360
a year working on we got to that point

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,360
um but nobody told one of the beloved

75
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
robots that we have on site and

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,200
that robot actually turned up on site

77
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,679
anyway

78
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,040
i think it might actually have been here

79
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,040
now so

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
but

81
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,239
obviously this event has not been smooth

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
sailing this year for many reasons that

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:53,360
you're aware of but also a lot that

84
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,120
you're not aware of

85
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,920
but

86
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
i'd like to quote myself

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,200
from 2018

88
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,480
when

89
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,480
i said it has been

90
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,720
the hardest event we've ever done

91
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,920
this has been

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,000
unbelievably brutal for all of us who

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,599
worked on it uh we are all broken um

94
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,920
this event almost did not happen several

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,839
times for many different reasons

96
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,879
those are the words someone doesn't who

97
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,239
does not know how bad it can get

98
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,599
just

99
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,879
yeah

100
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,040
this has been so much worse

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,720
um

102
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
it's it's a real mix of things and

103
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,840
everyone goes oh it's covered it's like

104
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,159
well a bit of it's covered but brexit's

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,480
been a real problem for us um it's been

106
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,680
very hard to get things into the country

107
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,519
our volunteers are a problem and the big

108
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:48,799
one really is the fact that we're up

109
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,080
against the queen and apparently she's

110
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,640
quite popular so

111
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,360
that's been really awkward for us so the

112
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,360
team has been incredible we've all

113
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,200
worked really hard on this for months

114
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,519
and months in in fact years at this

115
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
point um but the last six months has

116
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,920
been extra hard and unfortunately we've

117
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,760
had to make compromises and those who

118
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,760
were here in 2018 will remember that we

119
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,840
had problems with tents then and this

120
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,360
time we have all the big tops that's

121
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,799
that's great but the little tent's a bit

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
more of a problem and some things that

123
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,798
we would normally have we don't have so

124
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,000
we've got different toilets than we

125
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,440
would like um

126
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,800
they're fine but they're not the ones we

127
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,479
want we don't have a lot of equipment

128
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,840
facilities that we would normally have

129
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,600
we just can't get them

130
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
we cannot get a lot of the things we

131
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,000
need so our infrastructure is not what

132
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
it normally is and we ask if you keep

133
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:35,680
this in mind during the event please

134
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,479
don't treat it in an abusive way some

135
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,639
people like to stress stress test our

136
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,479
network we're asking you don't do that

137
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,720
this time because it is probably not

138
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,000
going to take it and that's worse for

139
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,520
everyone including us

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
so

141
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
also along with the toilets i hate

142
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,639
bringing up toilets but we have to talk

143
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
about this we don't have that many

144
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,840
accessible toilets please don't use them

145
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,360
unless you really need to use them

146
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,639
because they need to be kept for people

147
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:00,560
who actually need to use them

148
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,080
there are a limited number on site this

149
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
is awkward for us

150
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,759
we also ask that you don't mess with any

151
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,360
site infrastructure even if it's really

152
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
exciting has big red buttons do not

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,880
press any of the big red buttons do not

154
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
unplug anything and try and be helpful

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
you are almost certainly not being

156
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
helpful this has happened twice already

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:17,840
so

158
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,520
power outages are rubbish and we don't

159
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,240
want any more of them um and also please

160
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
don't take anything you didn't hire

161
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,520
people seem to think that it's okay to

162
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:26,800
just take bits of equipment and then we

163
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,680
don't know what happened to them and

164
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,039
someone has to run around for ages so

165
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:30,800
just please don't do that either

166
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,160
and most of all please be kind to

167
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,759
everyone who's making this happen

168
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:35,520
everyone who does this as a volunteer

169
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,440
every single person is unpaid doing this

170
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,280
just for their fun i'm one of those

171
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:43,638
people we buy our own tickets

172
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,759
i'm gonna have to go back and forward on

173
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,280
that and i said it's a loop here

174
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
we go um

175
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,000
so this is what's happened over the last

176
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
week in fact we've actually been here a

177
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,560
bit longer than a week but you'll know

178
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,919
all the big tents go up and then nothing

179
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,199
happens for ages and then suddenly

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:06,800
everyone arrives

181
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,240
which was pretty much how it's gone it's

182
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,880
been very quiet and then very busy but

183
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,800
this is uh from a drone that's been

184
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,880
taking the same photos every single day

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,520
for the last week and i'm very proud of

186
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,840
the team who's done this event because

187
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,600
this has been extremely hard for them to

188
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
get together and if it isn't quite clear

189
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
there's a lot of stuff that happens in

190
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,919
this field

191
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:27,360
and what you can't see from here is the

192
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,880
sheer number of cables

193
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,039
and it is truly many kilometers of

194
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,639
cables so you know keep an eye but this

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,840
year i'd like to do something different

196
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,440
uh most people who've been to mf before

197
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,360
know that at the end of the event

198
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,120
we thank everyone then

199
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,800
but we're all knackered and we could

200
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,639
really do with a bit of support

201
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:45,440
so

202
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,360
i'd like to thank all the team who are

203
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,880
there who are on site now who are

204
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,160
working some of them in this tent some

205
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,039
of them are running around the field

206
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
some of them are quite far away all the

207
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,080
way down another sector

208
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:54,960
and

209
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,080
the closing ceremony is always a bit

210
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,759
quieter because people left site but

211
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,160
you're all here now so i would like you

212
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,680
all to give the loudest round of

213
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,599
applause you possibly can

214
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,960
so we can hear it at the other end of

215
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,479
the site and everyone can actually

216
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,319
hopefully hear that what you that you

217
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,680
want them to be there

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:12,680
go

219
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:30,400
i'd also like to give a special thanks

220
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,000
to all the partners everyone on the team

221
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,280
because they've suffered through this

222
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,560
probably more than we have so

223
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
just want to make sure they get

224
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,840
recognized too

225
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,960
and of course we're all volunteers and

226
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,479
we're still volunteering and you're all

227
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:53,680
going to volunteer at this event aren't

228
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,479
you

229
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,680
so yes

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,599
we all need your help so everything here

231
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:00,000
is run by volunteers on site um we need

232
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,759
people to do everything from manning

233
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:04,240
cameras like people just here running av

234
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,319
uh just checking things we're going okay

235
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,360
on the site shipping things around

236
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,240
making making sure things are going okay

237
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
we have oh and everyone loves running in

238
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,000
the bar obviously but if you can spare

239
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,680
an hour or two during the event we will

240
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,120
feed you we'll make sure you're looked

241
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,280
after and we really need your help every

242
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
hour you help out makes it slightly

243
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,240
easier for us and slightly less

244
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,639
stressful you can sign up on the website

245
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,000
and you can also go to the info desk

246
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,840
just next to the bar please volunteer if

247
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,919
you can also if you can stay for tear

248
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,919
down on monday if probably until around

249
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,599
sort of 5 pm that would be really useful

250
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:34,799
because we're all knackered by that

251
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,159
point and we really can't get everything

252
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,200
down

253
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,679
and it really is a lot of work so

254
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,599
everyone can do that that would be great

255
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,360
anyway that was all the sort of

256
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
necessary bits i need to cover so let's

257
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
see the fun bits instead

258
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,519
so

259
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:48,720
i'm excited to talk about lots of new

260
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,519
things we have at emf this year

261
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,080
so first up we have the reef which is

262
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,240
for all the smaller people on site the

263
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,080
reef is new it's an area which you will

264
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,440
see because there's giant wavy robots

265
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,920
down there but it is a family area it

266
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,839
has a lounge it has a mini maker space

267
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,600
for kids to make things in it has a

268
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,320
workshop it has baby changing and it has

269
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,080
giant inflatable tentacle robots which

270
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,600
are the most important part

271
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,800
so

272
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,320
if you have small children you would

273
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,360
that's where you need to be heading

274
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
there's also a crash as well if you need

275
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,360
that

276
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,120
we also have an on-site shop for the

277
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,720
second time ever but the first time was

278
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,880
a long time ago but you can buy things

279
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,320
like milk and also other critical

280
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,320
camping accessories like soldering irons

281
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,360
so

282
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,920
that will be open every day and

283
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,880
you can

284
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,800
hopefully pick out also order in things

285
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,320
there as well so if you've forgotten 10

286
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,440
pegs or something please don't forget

287
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
10px then they should be able to sort

288
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,240
you out

289
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,600
also our workshops are different this

290
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,279
year our workshops are hosted by the

291
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,800
villages so

292
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,320
this time if you go to a workshop you'll

293
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,920
be going into a village run by a group

294
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
of people with a common set of interests

295
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,600
hopefully that means you'll discover

296
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
something new and you can meet some new

297
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,880
people make make some friends otherwise

298
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:54,160
you would have been in a tent which is

299
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,920
quite separate so hopefully that will

300
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,920
work um and also there is of course the

301
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,680
abandoned research facility at the north

302
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,160
end of the site which will open at 7 pm

303
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,640
tonight so i look forward to

304
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,320
that myself i have not been yet so we'll

305
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,079
see what happens

306
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,360
uh and

307
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,120
also we have a new version of our own

308
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,640
beer so on the bar you will find the

309
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,160
dynamo beer that was brewed specifically

310
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:17,440
for this event

311
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,040
it is delicious i recommend you drink it

312
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,640
while stocks last because it all goes in

313
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,000
like the first day

314
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:22,800
so

315
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,519
get in quickly

316
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,920
and for the first time in a decade

317
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,160
the very first time the badges are

318
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,560
available now

319
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,760
we've kept this quite quiet because if

320
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
you've noticed there's been some supply

321
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,880
chain problems around the world for the

322
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,160
last year

323
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,000
and honestly we didn't have them until

324
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
about five days ago so it's been a bit

325
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,120
stressful but this is the emf tidal

326
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,360
badge um it is the latest in a line of

327
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,600
badges it has a usbc socket and plugs

328
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
directly into your laptop or phone if

329
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,120
you must

330
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,200
it has a very high resolution tiny

331
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,959
screen on it an accelerometer a

332
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:08,959
magnetometer full usb support and an

333
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:10,399
onboard cryptography chip for doing

334
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:12,399
interesting cryptography things

335
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,160
you do not need to install any software

336
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,399
on your laptop to use this it runs in

337
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:17,680
or the entire development environment

338
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,120
runs in the browser so you can open a

339
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,320
browser and start working on it straight

340
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,360
away

341
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,200
we have an app store it has wi-fi of

342
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,000
course

343
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,880
um

344
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,200
and also it is designed to be like a usb

345
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,120
stick because after the event and when

346
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,160
we're not launching this during the

347
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,279
event for reasons it'll become clear

348
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:34,880
later um this works as a u2f dongle

349
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,000
which some people understand what that

350
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
means but it means that you can use it

351
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,279
to securely authenticate with websites

352
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,720
so instead of using a password you can

353
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,120
use this and it cannot be hacked in any

354
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,760
reasonable way

355
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,720
it also has the very popular torch mode

356
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,480
so

357
00:11:58,480 --> 00:11:59,760
uh these will be available for

358
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,360
collection from the badge tent i believe

359
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,040
immediately after this talk but maybe it

360
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,399
will be a little later go and check the

361
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,480
signs um there are two thousand ready to

362
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,440
go right now uh if those run out a bit

363
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,680
more a bit later on but uh there is also

364
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,360
workshops and talks about the badge

365
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
later on if you want to hear how they

366
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,600
made it and all the trials and

367
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,120
tribulations they went through there is

368
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,760
a talk on sunday this is not the first

369
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,519
badge they designed it was just the one

370
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,600
they could make so i recommend going to

371
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,519
that talk

372
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,480
so

373
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,320
if you're here in 2018

374
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,600
you will also know that we tasked a

375
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,839
satellite to image the site

376
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:33,519
unfortunately it didn't work because it

377
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:34,639
was cloudy the entire time because

378
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,639
there's a uk but this came back

379
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:38,160
afterwards and you can see quite clearly

380
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:39,920
where an old sector was because all the

381
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,040
grass is dead

382
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:43,199
so

383
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,920
it was slightly mis unfortunate but

384
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,240
this was the best we managed to do

385
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,399
of course we're doing it again

386
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,720
so this time planet labs are helping us

387
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,040
helping us out so planet labs have

388
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,320
satellites that are going to be imaging

389
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
the site every single day unfortunately

390
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,680
i don't know what times they're going to

391
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,279
be imaging the site so you're going to

392
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,720
have to lie in place on the ground for a

393
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,800
really long time to hope you get there

394
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,320
and like smile occasionally at the

395
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,240
clouds and see i don't know it's it's

396
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,240
it's going to be hard but they'll be

397
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:12,240
taking photos every day hopefully more

398
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,519
than once a day so we'll get some nice

399
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,120
pictures of the site if you want to lay

400
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
things out on the ground to try and

401
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
write things to space

402
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,399
you know go nuts

403
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,000
also

404
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,839
and this is a bit unusual

405
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:25,120
planet labs

406
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,160
are going to be launching some

407
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:27,680
satellites later this year and they're

408
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,560
letting us decorate them

409
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,680
so

410
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,279
three satellites later this year will be

411
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,880
launching and they will have artwork on

412
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,480
the sides of them etched into the side

413
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,160
of the satellites that will be supplied

414
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:41,439
by attendees of this event

415
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,519
we might just write cyber on the side of

416
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,199
it i don't know yet but

417
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,959
um details of how this is going to work

418
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:49,040
will emerge later in the event this may

419
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
happen after the event we're not quite

420
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
sure yet it's details are still being

421
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,279
worked out but we're hoping to make sure

422
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,639
that everyone has the opportunity to get

423
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,839
something on a satellite in orbit

424
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,279
which obviously doesn't really matter to

425
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,199
this event but it's still pretty cool so

426
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,639
and it was and also these satellites

427
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,720
will be in orbit for the next emf so

428
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,760
you'll be able to point at them or

429
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,399
something i don't know

430
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,120
finally we need to make sure everyone

431
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
has a safe and enjoyable time at emf

432
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,399
uh kobe is still a problem people are

433
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:17,839
falling ill with covet all the time we

434
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,680
have lost several speakers

435
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:20,959
some of those speakers will be

436
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,800
presenting over zoom some of them cannot

437
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,079
make it now

438
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:25,680
we want you all to be as safe as

439
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,120
possible so

440
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,480
if you can

441
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,560
please test daily make sure you're

442
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:32,079
actually checking yourself

443
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,399
please mask if you're in crowded spaces

444
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:35,600
there are some tents which will be much

445
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:36,880
more crowded and there's airflow in all

446
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:38,560
of them is pretty good so don't be too

447
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,639
concerned but just worth saying

448
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,680
um

449
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,680
if you need tests tests are available

450
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,199
for free if you have symptoms from the

451
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,199
first aid tent or they're available at

452
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,040
cost from the shop

453
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,959
and our first aid team are around 24 7

454
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,240
to help you if you have any health

455
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,839
issues whatsoever anything if you've got

456
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,920
a cut you've fallen over or you feel ill

457
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,199
or whatever

458
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,959
the most important thing though is as

459
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:00,560
ever do not look into the lasers with

460
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,560
the remaining eye the first aid team

461
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,160
cannot help you with that so

462
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,240
that is all the notices i have for this

463
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,240
the final thing we have is to thank all

464
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,000
sponsors that made this happen this year

465
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,519
so what a lot of people don't realize is

466
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,120
that the ticket price for emf just pays

467
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,639
for the basic infrastructure cost of

468
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,399
this event it pays for the tents it pays

469
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:19,600
better the power pays for everything to

470
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,040
happen it doesn't pay for any of the

471
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,079
shiny things it doesn't pay for the

472
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,440
child care it doesn't pay for the badge

473
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,199
doesn't pay for all that extra nice

474
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,199
things we have all of that we need

475
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:28,560
sponsorship for and it's so we can keep

476
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,000
the ticket cost as low as possible for

477
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,240
you it's hard for us to do that

478
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,160
everything has been very very expensive

479
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,839
this year fuel costs have been

480
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,000
astronomical and it this is just what

481
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,279
it's cost

482
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,920
but all these sponsors are on site if

483
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,000
you see them please thank them and they

484
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,160
will all love to hear from you

485
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,320
and that is everything i have to say

486
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,279
so

487
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,320
have fun

488
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,680
and then we'll see you back here on

489
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:54,160
sunday at i think 7 pm i scheduled that

490
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,440
i should know but i genuinely can't

491
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,680
remember

492
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:58,959
and then i need to get off the stage

493
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,560
because in 20 minutes this stage becomes

494
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,320
the first talk and all the other stages

495
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,759
start at the same time and all the

496
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,639
workshops and the whole site lights up

497
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,720
so thank you very much for coming i hope

498
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,639
you have a wonderful time

499
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,399
do you say thank you to any volunteers

500
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,240
you see if you see someone wearing hives

501
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,360
