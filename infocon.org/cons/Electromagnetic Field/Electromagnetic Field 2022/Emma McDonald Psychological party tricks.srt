1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:03,600
okay so good morning

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,779
um so to warm your brains up I'd like

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,780
you to try and read the paragraph on

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:12,079
screen

5
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,199
thank you guys

6
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,140
okay so give me a wave if you've been

7
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,719
able to read the paragraph

8
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,039
excellent brilliant everybody's awake

9
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,420
so

10
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:00,359
this is a paragraph unjumbled

11
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,620
and

12
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,899
I like this paragraph because it shows

13
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,299
just how automatic our reading ability

14
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:09,180
has become so when you start off

15
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,820
learning how to read you're having to

16
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:13,439
sound out each letter and it's really

17
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,280
effort it takes a lot of effort but as

18
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,900
we've developed in our reading ability

19
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,600
it's become so automatic that even when

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,000
the words are all jumbled up that we are

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,560
still able to make sense of things

22
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,119
so this is the psychological party

23
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:32,939
tricks talk and one of the first things

24
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:35,280
I said in the description is that I

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,640
can't read your mind

26
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
um so I just thought I'd do a little

27
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,299
demonstration of this

28
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:43,799
so

29
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,500
can everybody pick a card don't tell the

30
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,060
people next to you

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,259
I just want you to memorize the card

32
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,780
so pick one of the cards and memorize it

33
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,020
please

34
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,600
okay has everybody got a card

35
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:02,399
yep

36
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,299
okay so this is me I'm Dr Emma McDonald

37
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:10,020
um on Twitter I'm ninja cats

38
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,420
um I'm a psychologist I'm mainly

39
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,480
interested in teaching and learning

40
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,879
teaching statistics memory and dyslexia

41
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:20,400
which is what my PhD was actually in but

42
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,980
as a lot of people with phds most of my

43
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,500
time is spent doing something completely

44
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,040
different to the subject to my PhD

45
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,900
um I'm a senior lecturer at Cardiff

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,760
Metropolitan University in Psychology

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,459
and education and I spend most of my

48
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:38,480
time teaching on a Master's in

49
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,160
psychology in education so it's very

50
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:44,640
much applying psychology to education in

51
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
the classroom

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,420
but I spend most of my time listening to

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,640
a rocker metal station called primordial

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,519
so any rocker metal fans in the crowd I

55
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,200
recommend checking out that radio

56
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,220
station

57
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,140
and I've got our two pictures of my

58
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,480
lovely overlords Audrey and Archie up

59
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,000
there who spend most their time

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,459
paying it a lot of tension invading Zoom

61
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:09,000
meetings and causing Havoc

62
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,060
so that's just a little bit about me

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,760
so hopefully everyone can still remember

64
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,000
the card they picked yep

65
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,280
okay so I should have made your card

66
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,379
disappear now

67
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,300
so can you put your hands up if your

68
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,379
card is missing

69
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,040
good start

70
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,000
has anyone know exactly how I did this

71
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
yeah

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,200
I see a hands going up

73
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,260
so what you'll notice is I've changed

74
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,159
all the cards

75
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,099
so these are the original set of cards

76
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,140
and the thing is key thing is I only

77
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:57,360
asked you to focus on remembering one of

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,560
them

79
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,780
then I distracted you for a while to

80
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,480
hopefully get you to forget all the

81
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,720
other cards only the one you remembered

82
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,580
and because they're all very similar

83
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,920
it's quite easy to do that

84
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,780
and so that's where there's completely

85
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:15,180
different set of cards appeared

86
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:17,699
somebody like wow

87
00:04:17,699 --> 00:04:21,238
sorry about oh I know this one

88
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:23,639
so it's quite a nice little party trick

89
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:25,380
especially when lots of people say oh

90
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,820
you're a psychologist can you read my

91
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,960
mind

92
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,419
I can try

93
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:32,340
so this is another nice little

94
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:34,740
demonstration it's

95
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,820
a gif and if you focus on it you can

96
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,160
actually change the direction of the

97
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,300
train

98
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:45,300
so it'll go you might see it coming

99
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,000
towards you and then if you focus you

100
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,860
can make it go in a different direction

101
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,460
foreign

102
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,080
managed to change direction of the train

103
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:05,759
excellent it's really annoying after the

104
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,039
first time you've done it kind of

105
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:10,320
constantly flipped which is quite

106
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,840
irritating

107
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,259
so now I've got another one and just a

108
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:19,020
warning for anyone who's sensitive to

109
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,360
flashing images there are images

110
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,580
flashing here so it's an image then it's

111
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,560
a gray screen and then it's an image

112
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,580
again

113
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:29,940
so the aim of this is for you to Spot

114
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,080
the Difference

115
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,360
between the two images

116
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,280
so you'll see a first image it'll flash

117
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,620
up gray screen and then it will show a

118
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,539
second image and I want you to try and

119
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,000
Spot the Difference between the images

120
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,919
now when you see the difference if you

121
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,020
could put up your hand

122
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,240
so once you've Spot the Difference if

123
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,860
you could put up the hand so I can see

124
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,960
you've spotted it

125
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,060
so here's the first one

126
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,860
so hand up when you spot the difference

127
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,199
okay A lot of people are spotting it

128
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,380
some people looking very frustrated

129
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,360
for those of you who haven't spotted the

130
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,400
difference look at the red drink and

131
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,719
count the number of straws

132
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,919
okay so here's another one

133
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:24,660
again hands up when you spot the

134
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,780
difference

135
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,259
harder

136
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,220
okay

137
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
let's

138
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,280
so again look at the bottom of the

139
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,900
screen count the number of arches

140
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,060
so that was a bigger change in the

141
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,139
picture

142
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,060
but because it was down at the bottom of

143
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,940
the screen people find it a lot more

144
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,220
difficult

145
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,039
so here we have another one so again

146
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:12,479
hands up when you spot the difference

147
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,400
some people are getting really good at

148
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,758
this now

149
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,740
so the disappearing Great Wall of China

150
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,259
and I think this is the most tricky one

151
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:46,979
sometimes it still catches me out if I

152
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:48,479
haven't looked at this picture for a

153
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,599
while

154
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,919
so

155
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,740
so again it's on the edge of

156
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:20,699
the picture and this these kind of

157
00:08:20,699 --> 00:08:22,379
little tricks are really good at

158
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,160
demonstrating how our Vision Works so

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,840
what you think you're seeing is you're

160
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,460
thinking you're seeing a whole picture

161
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,780
so you think you're looking at that

162
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:33,000
whole slide or the whole image at the

163
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,339
front actually what your eye is doing is

164
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:38,159
dartering it down and building up an

165
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,080
image in your mind

166
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,240
and because this is a small change in

167
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
the image often unless you're looking at

168
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,380
that person's screen at exactly the

169
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,660
right time you won't be able to see the

170
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,740
difference

171
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,019
and as I said the first one you found

172
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:53,880
quite easy many of you because it was at

173
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,800
the center of the image and we tend to

174
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,220
focus on the center of the image and

175
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,920
build up the picture around it so the

176
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,899
ones that the changes that are on the

177
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:09,019
edge after much more difficult to spot

178
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,100
so I've been speaking for a while I'm

179
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,120
going to hand over to another

180
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,880
psychologist Richard Wiseman now hi I'm

181
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,800
Richard this is Sarah and we're going to

182
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,959
perform the amazing color changing card

183
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,360
trick with this blue-backed deck of

184
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,060
cards now the idea is very simple I'm

185
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,500
just going to spread the cards in front

186
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,779
of Sarah and ask her to push any car

187
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:29,940
towards the camper

188
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,339
I'm like okay let's see I'm gonna go for

189
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:39,180
this card here okay now Sarah could have

190
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,760
selected any card at all from the deck

191
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,100
but she selected the card which is now

192
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,380
face down on the table what I'm going to

193
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:49,019
ask her to do is show us which card she

194
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,580
selected

195
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,220
right so the card that I chose was in

196
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,519
fact the three of diamonds the three of

197
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:58,920
diamonds okay excellent choice that card

198
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,200
goes back into the deck now I'm just

199
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,540
going to spread the cards face up on the

200
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,060
table do a little click of the fingers

201
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,760
and you'll see that Sarah's card here

202
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,940
has now got a blue back not particularly

203
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:13,560
surprising what's slightly more

204
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,440
surprising is all of the other cards

205
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,820
have got red backs and that is the

206
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:23,580
amazing color changing Archer

207
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:30,100
[Music]

208
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,190
[Applause]

209
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:43,380
hi I'm Richard this is Sarah and we're

210
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,000
going to perform the amazing color

211
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,220
changing card trick with this blue back

212
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,160
deck of cards now the idea is very

213
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,019
simple I'm just going to spread the cars

214
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:53,940
in front of Sarah and ask her to push

215
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,760
any car towards the camper

216
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:02,160
I'm like okay let's see I'm gonna go for

217
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
this card here okay now Sarah could have

218
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,579
selected any card at all from the deck

219
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,920
but she selected the card which is now

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,200
face down on the table what I'm going to

221
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,839
ask her to do is show us which card she

222
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,459
selected

223
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,100
right so the card that I chose was in

224
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,339
fact the three of diamonds the three of

225
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:25,620
diamonds okay an excellent choice that

226
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,899
card goes back into the deck now I'm

227
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:29,820
just going to spread the cards face up

228
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:32,040
on the table do a little click of the

229
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:32,880
fingers

230
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,579
and you'll see that Sarah's card here

231
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,760
has now got a blue back not particularly

232
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,380
surprising what's slightly more

233
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:44,040
surprising is all of the other cars have

234
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:48,000
got red backs and that is the amazing

235
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,330
color changing Archer

236
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:56,099
[Music]

237
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,300
it means very good he's a magician

238
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,000
and a psychologist

239
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,740
um he's got loads of really cool videos

240
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:06,839
he's also got lots of really good books

241
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:09,720
and they're designed for people that

242
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,420
aren't necessarily have any intention of

243
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:16,139
studying psychology mainly for fun hands

244
00:12:16,139 --> 00:12:17,940
up if you spotted any of the changes the

245
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,700
first time you watch that video

246
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:23,880
okay interestingly wave your hand if

247
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,260
you've seen that video before if you

248
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,459
spotted it

249
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:28,200
Okay so

250
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,120
there's only a very small number of

251
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,980
people that notice any changes and again

252
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:35,639
it's that same principle we think we're

253
00:12:35,639 --> 00:12:38,459
seeing the whole screen you think you're

254
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,019
watching the whole video but actually

255
00:12:40,019 --> 00:12:42,779
you were focused on the magic trick and

256
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:45,360
that's the AIM so Focus you're you're

257
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,740
focusing your attention to the magic

258
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,500
trick and then you don't spot all the

259
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,600
changes in the background

260
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,940
and there is a lot of bigger changes in

261
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,339
that video there and that's the

262
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:59,579
principle a lot of magicians use so a

263
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:02,160
lot of magic magic is all based on

264
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:04,019
getting the audience to focus their

265
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:06,180
attention on a particular spot on a

266
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:09,120
particular action and then you don't

267
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,660
notice all the other things going on

268
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,360
so moving on from kind of tricks of your

269
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:18,540
vision where there's changing images one

270
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,399
of the things that I don't know if you

271
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
are aware about is the idea of this halo

272
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,860
effect so we tend to judge people more

273
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,300
positively if they are more attractive

274
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,579
so the more attractive someone we often

275
00:13:32,579 --> 00:13:34,459
give them kind of more positive

276
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:38,519
characteristics so on screen here I have

277
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,839
two famous and controversial depending

278
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:44,579
on which end of the spectrum you're on

279
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:47,940
and leaders but they were both generally

280
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,940
classed as quite attractive

281
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,540
um and they would seem quite positively

282
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,600
now some of you may be wondering why

283
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:00,000
I've put them on upside down

284
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,260
fight turn the images correctly

285
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,260
foreign

286
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:11,160
so again this teaches us a lot about

287
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,760
facial processing we focus a lot on the

288
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,740
eyes and the mouth

289
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:20,579
and I say they looked quite normal

290
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:23,940
when they were upside down because the

291
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:25,620
mouth and the eyes are upside down and

292
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:28,320
that's what we focus on so it's very

293
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,240
easy for you to look at those images and

294
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:32,519
go yeah that's fine

295
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,040
um it's only when you realize how messed

296
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:40,699
up the image are it's very very freaky

297
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,399
so this is another one which is quite

298
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:46,800
interesting and this apparently I

299
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,839
haven't verified it was not come up with

300
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,839
by psychologists it was come up with by

301
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,959
schoolboys but there are psychological

302
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,440
principles in place here so what you see

303
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,380
on screen here are perfectly respectable

304
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,959
celebrities in swimming costumes

305
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,980
now if I cover up this picture it gets

306
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:09,120
Ruder

307
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,720
okay

308
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:14,839
foreign

309
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,360
and

310
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:23,160
we like to fill in gaps with our mind

311
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,959
and unless we were told they were

312
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,760
wearing swim costumes we like to fill it

313
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:30,680
in with the rudest possible option

314
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,860
so again perfectly respectful not so

315
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,139
much and remember it's your mind doing

316
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:40,220
that that's not me

317
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,060
so I've been talking for a while now and

318
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,300
I really want to get you guys to do a

319
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,980
bit of talking

320
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,660
um all together

321
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,600
hopefully so what I'm going to do is I'm

322
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,540
going to show you a screen of words

323
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,820
and instead of reading what the word

324
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:03,180
says I want you to say the color it is

325
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:05,579
printed in so we're going to have a

326
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:09,779
practice one on here so the big word

327
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,579
we're not going to say psychology we're

328
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,440
saying the color it's printed in so

329
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:16,139
everyone together

330
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,480
okay brilliant

331
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,699
okay everyone ready for the next screen

332
00:16:20,699 --> 00:16:23,100
and if you make a mistake say it again

333
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,839
and we'll see how long it takes everyone

334
00:16:24,839 --> 00:16:26,880
to get through the screen

335
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,699
so off we go so blue

336
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:57,420
okay everyone's finished about the same

337
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,339
time which is nice

338
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:02,759
I don't find that quite easy

339
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:05,459
okay some of you I can feel giggling

340
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,699
because you know what's coming next

341
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:11,400
so we're gonna do it again on my second

342
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,780
screen saying rule the play so it's red

343
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:22,539
[Music]

344
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:34,720
[Music]

345
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,480
and everything

346
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,860
okay so I could hear everybody start off

347
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:57,660
really well and you're like yes I've got

348
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,820
this and normally by the second line

349
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:03,480
everyone starts going a bit Haywire

350
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,220
so again this is another one of those

351
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,160
kind of principles about how automatic

352
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,980
our reading has become so when you're in

353
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,620
well preschool you learn colors first

354
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,960
you're able to point at something and go

355
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,940
that's red that's yellow you were able

356
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,039
to name colors before you were able to

357
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,000
read

358
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,880
but reading takes over it becomes

359
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:26,580
automatic so you all are then having a

360
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:28,440
little mental battle in your heads going

361
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,200
no don't read it say the color

362
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,059
and again it's just a really nice

363
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,419
demonstration of how far we've come and

364
00:18:36,419 --> 00:18:38,160
again it's always when you start to

365
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,380
learn something new it's always effort

366
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:43,380
it takes a lot of effort and it's quite

367
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:45,539
hard to pick up something new but this

368
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,520
is a nice demonstration of just how far

369
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,679
you've come in Reading even if you found

370
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:51,480
it very difficult to start with I'm

371
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,539
severely dyslexic and again I can do

372
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:57,600
this and it still tricks me up

373
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,840
okay so this is a nice dilemma for you

374
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,000
and it's quite a big room

375
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,720
so imagine this was an example now

376
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,380
and you get the final page of your exam

377
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,840
and you see this message

378
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:16,200
select whether you want two extra points

379
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,240
or marks same word

380
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,760
um two extra points or six extra points

381
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,720
added to your final art exam grave so

382
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:26,760
you get to choose whether you have two

383
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,679
or six extra points added to your final

384
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:32,400
exam great but there's a small catch

385
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,220
if more than 10 of the people exec are

386
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,400
taking exams like six marks then nobody

387
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
in the whole room gets any extra marks

388
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,860
so you're not allowed this to discuss

389
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:46,080
this with the people around you you can

390
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,880
have a look around the room see how many

391
00:19:47,880 --> 00:19:49,380
people are here

392
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:51,299
decide whether you would select either

393
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:56,000
two or six so don't discuss it

394
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,740
okay hopefully everyone's made this

395
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,880
decision

396
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,820
so I'm going to ask everyone who thinks

397
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:08,039
they're going to take six marks can you

398
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:09,840
put up your hand

399
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,539
okay

400
00:20:11,539 --> 00:20:15,200
nobody's gonna get anything

401
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,299
one of the things that's interesting is

402
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:22,020
do you think you would have changed your

403
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:24,179
mind if you were able to talk to the

404
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:25,679
people around you so do you think you

405
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,360
would have behaved differently

406
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,120
if it's a smaller group would you be

407
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,000
that made a different decision if they

408
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,520
were all people you knew well would you

409
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:38,640
make a different decision and this is a

410
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,840
really nice dilemma and it's something

411
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,440
that's been used a lot in economics

412
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,380
um for many years but one of the things

413
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,940
that's interesting that's been applied

414
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,520
to at the moment is about environmental

415
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,559
science and climate change

416
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,780
because one of the things that we have

417
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,059
to do to help prevent climate change is

418
00:20:57,059 --> 00:20:59,940
always pick the two so make the more

419
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,340
difficult decision so maybe spend more

420
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,140
money on an electric car or make more

421
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,720
effort to get public transport so it's

422
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,700
less easy for us

423
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,460
but it's better for everybody overall in

424
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:14,159
a bigger picture so this is quite a nice

425
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,919
little example and it's been applied to

426
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,960
I would say the world's biggest problem

427
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,620
at the moment

428
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:24,120
so I'm coming towards the end of the

429
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,000
talk now and it is the morning but I am

430
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,400
a memory researcher originally so I'd

431
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:32,760
like you to memorize this list of words

432
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,440
so I'm going to give you a little bit of

433
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:38,780
time to memorize this list now

434
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,700
please don't cheat and write it down or

435
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,299
take a photo

436
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:09,299
okay so hopefully you've got to the end

437
00:22:09,299 --> 00:22:10,919
of that list

438
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,620
so I've got two nice little riddles for

439
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:17,039
you now and again it shows kind of how

440
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,140
we think quite often

441
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,179
so we've got the first one about the

442
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:23,220
lily pads and the second one about the

443
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,659
Baton ball

444
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,820
again have a chat with the people next

445
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,880
to you

446
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,380
see if you can work out the answer to

447
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,740
the two

448
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,219
thank you

449
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:13,700
thank you

450
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:29,159
okay first for the lily pads can anyone

451
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:30,510
tell me the answer

452
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,679
[Applause]

453
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:36,000
47 excellent so it doubles in size so

454
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,740
the day before it was half filling the

455
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,620
pond what about the Baton ball

456
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,979
foreign

457
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,000
yeah

458
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,299
so again often we kind of take mental

459
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:50,580
shortcuts with our thinking

460
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:53,059
and again it's one of those very famous

461
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:55,860
books in psychology of fast thinking

462
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,600
fast and slow and we're constantly

463
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,820
taking mental shortcuts and people

464
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,380
really struggle with these problems

465
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,480
because the way that we kind of process

466
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,520
the information

467
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,460
we often kind of jump to one conclusion

468
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,220
rather than another but that was just a

469
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,299
distraction

470
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,679
the big thing was the memory test so

471
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:18,900
when I show these these words I wish

472
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,299
when you say yes if you saw them on the

473
00:24:21,299 --> 00:24:23,940
original list and know if they were not

474
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,539
on the original list so start off dream

475
00:24:27,539 --> 00:24:29,580
cat

476
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,299
yup

477
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,400
okay brilliant you were all wonderful

478
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,679
participants because

479
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,140
these are the answers

480
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:50,460
and I was able to implant a false memory

481
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:53,039
and because sleep was not in the

482
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:55,260
original list and I'm doing another talk

483
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:57,480
today about memory

484
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,400
and this is one of the principles that

485
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,279
we use in that talk is that we often

486
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,580
memorize lists based on their meaning

487
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:09,659
now if you go back to the original list

488
00:25:09,659 --> 00:25:12,120
you'll notice every single one of those

489
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:15,539
words are very semantically for meaning

490
00:25:15,539 --> 00:25:18,120
wise linked to memory

491
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:20,820
so the way that we memorize things we

492
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:23,100
have a network and every time you're

493
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,659
reading one of those words it was

494
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:27,659
triggering the word sleep

495
00:25:27,659 --> 00:25:29,220
and so we would go sleep sleep sleep

496
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,980
sleep every time you read those words

497
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,659
then I did a lovely little bit of

498
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,279
distraction and getting you to chat to

499
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:36,900
the people around you to get some more

500
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,900
distraction in there and so

501
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,299
here when you came to this list you were

502
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:43,260
like

503
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,659
now suresleep must have been on that

504
00:25:45,659 --> 00:25:47,940
list and thank you for all the people

505
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,980
that said yes but well done so there's

506
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:52,559
people with excellent memory that said

507
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,419
no

508
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:57,120
but again it's a nice demonstration of

509
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,400
how fallible our memory is so even on a

510
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,880
short memory test like that I was able

511
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,480
to implant a false memory so we're all

512
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:09,380
susceptible to them

513
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:15,799
you guys so much for taking part

514
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:19,919
at McDonald's my Twitter handles ninja

515
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,860
cats and that's a lovely cat pretending

516
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:26,360
to be a raven or a crow

517
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,299
thank you

518
00:26:32,779 --> 00:26:36,840
and obviously I've been analyzing you

519
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,460
all since you got here so I've created a

520
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:44,400
personality profile for you so have a

521
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,559
read of this see if I've got it slightly

522
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,039
accurate

523
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,450
[Music]

524
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:05,779
uh

525
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,360
so give me a little wave if I've maybe

526
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,980
got about 50 accurate or higher

527
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,260
oh there's a few people admitting to it

528
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:18,659
so obviously I haven't been analyzing

529
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:21,120
you this is a paragraph full of Barnum

530
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,760
statements that generally most people

531
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:26,700
will think applies to themselves so to

532
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:28,440
see there's a load of caveats in there

533
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:31,919
so people go oh yes that's a bit like me

534
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,779
and this is the sort of thing that's

535
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:36,659
used a lot by fortune tellers and people

536
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,779
that do star signs so lots of Barnum

537
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:41,460
statements but I think it's a really

538
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:43,620
nice demonstration that

539
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,840
it's we're all quite similar there's a

540
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,340
lot of things about insecurities in

541
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,140
there we all have different insecurities

542
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,179
we all have our own mental health issues

543
00:27:51,179 --> 00:27:53,220
and it's something that we should

544
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:56,039
recognize that brings us together as a

545
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:58,200
group but thank you guys very much for

546
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,150
your attention today

547
00:27:59,150 --> 00:28:08,479
