4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,640

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,160
a lot of people have from a lot of teams

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,680
have done a lot of work over the last

9
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,680
few months to make this event happen a

10
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,320
lot of it hopefully was invisible

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,160
um so we're gonna have a whistle-stop

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,558
tour through the various teams that have

13
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,239
been involved in this event not all of

14
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,680
them i'm afraid just the ones i managed

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,480
to color in the bar last night

16
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,719
um and we'll begin with the with the

17
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,640
site where everything

18
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,680
always starts yes yes hello um this is

19
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,039
going to be a bit powerpoint karaoke

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:48,640
because i haven't really gone through

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,480
these slides in any detail and i didn't

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,760
write any of them people have just done

23
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,520
them for me

24
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
so um yes we got here

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:59,199
wednesday of last week

26
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:02,239
um tuesday tuesday of last week

27
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,199
um

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,840
and uh and

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,840
got into the field and just plugged the

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
internet in

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,720
which is quite easy this time

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
and uh this is kind of the state of our

33
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,280
storage unit before the event you'll

34
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
you'll see that uh it's very tidy and it

35
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
won't be like that by the end of next

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,080
week

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,759
um

38
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,159
we had some vehicles we had some

39
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:26,880
vehicles that broke as they tend to do

40
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,560
we had some more vehicles these also

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,960
broke because as they tend to do but

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,400
they are all still

43
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,159
just about drivable

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,720
um we have a truck

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,079
um

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,159
which is great actually

47
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,159
i really like it the amount of time you

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,360
spend

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,520
running a festival is mostly dealing

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,840
with fluids of some sort or another

51
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,280
and um

52
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,000
and uh we produce a lot of waste water

53
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,079
because you all like showers which i

54
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,798
find a bit weird

55
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,520
just get rid of that spider

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,799
um

57
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:02,799
fluids more fluids we had we had a

58
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:05,280
really quite significantly increased

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,280
plumbing operation this time

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,840
um including some tremendous artwork

61
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:13,760
from ben here um installation plumbing

62
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,040
um

63
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,879
we had a shower on top of a tank that's

64
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,959
our crew shower which we were using for

65
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,000
build up

66
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,480
and um

67
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,160
oh hang on yeah

68
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,200
so

69
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
we did put a lot of we we bought a lot

70
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,400
of plumbing fittings hopefully we can

71
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,920
return some of them

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,160
um

73
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,640
we there was a thousand pound screw fix

74
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,000
order because we're like how many pipes

75
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,480
do we need i don't know just just just

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
stick a load on screw fix

77
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,480
um

78
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,640
lots of lighting 1.2 kilometers of this

79
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,040
festoon lighting which is important

80
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,160
so you can see where you're going and

81
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,400
not trip over things

82
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,720
we got these radios um which were quite

83
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,680
nice

84
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,760
um we got we got upgraded i think we got

85
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,840
upgraded because i told the guy who was

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
hiring them to us they were all nerds

87
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,239
and um and they were like oh

88
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:04,000
we've sent you all of the nice radios

89
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,360
and i'm like oh well hopefully we

90
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
don't lose any then

91
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
um

92
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
we got a battery backed our repeater

93
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,599
which actually

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,360
proved useful when the power failed

95
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,720
yesterday

96
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,879
um that was on the grid power it was

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,000
like oh the grid power's not going to

98
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,360
fail but we might as well get a battery

99
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,879
on there anyway

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,040
um

101
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,599
which was good um

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,519
we had a significantly increased gas

103
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:30,959
set up this time for the volunteer

104
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,239
catering which we were like oh we'll

105
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,560
sort that out and then a couple of weeks

106
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:35,920
ago we were like oh we're not going to

107
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,519
be able to sort that out ourselves so we

108
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,040
have like

109
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,120
one inch gas pipe and all sorts of

110
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,000
nonsense installed by a supplier um i

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
think they have to come and uninstall it

112
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,840
as well

113
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,879
we had a lot of construction stuff which

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,879
you may have seen around the the kind of

115
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,760
boring stuff like sinks and work tops

116
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,040
and things

117
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,599
again this is

118
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,879
this is something that we were like oh

119
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:02,480
we'll just finesse it while we're on

120
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,000
site and then it's like oh we need quite

121
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,120
a lot of

122
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,080
wood and things and post boxes and sinks

123
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:09,040
and

124
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,959
i don't even know what else i didn't do

125
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,280
any of that

126
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,400
signage

127
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,439
um

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,839
we we have to pay for signage because

129
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,918
the council likes us too so you you will

130
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,440
prove probably have seen those signs on

131
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,919
the way in um

132
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,520
we changed them a little bit over last

133
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,639
time because

134
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,320
last time it said eastern castle and the

135
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
castle got a lot of visitors so um

136
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,560
we uh we there's there's a bit of an art

137
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,800
to all of this which we are still

138
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,600
learning it turns out

139
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,520
steam festival jesus

140
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,280
there was a steam there was a steam

141
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:45,199
festival last weekend and they were not

142
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,720
very good at finding the right entrance

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
and a lot of them came in here and

144
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,280
they're like is this the steam festival

145
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,560
i'm like does it look like a steam

146
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,800
festival it's the complete opposite of a

147
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,000
steam festival

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,520
didn't go to the steam festival i think

149
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,040
mark did

150
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,039
great it was good apparently you should

151
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
go next year

152
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,400
um

153
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,120
power which i'm also doing

154
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,479
this was our power plan for this year

155
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,400
you're not expected to read that

156
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,120
um we have

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:15,120
slightly improved i wanted to improve it

158
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,400
further but i didn't have enough time

159
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,440
the

160
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,280
the computational power planning

161
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,960
software from last time so that

162
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,440
pre-calculates all of the

163
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,120
stuff and tells me whether the cables

164
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,080
are too long or you know the breakers

165
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,440
won't be able to trip in time and stuff

166
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,320
like that um that's

167
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,960
all kind of printed out and then

168
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:38,320
laminates it all and um scribbles on it

169
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,360
and uh

170
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
and well basically what happens is our

171
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,560
power supply sends us a slightly

172
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
different set of stuff from what i plan

173
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,039
for

174
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,600
and um and then we have to spend our

175
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,880
ages working out if we've got enough

176
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,280
sockets for everything so that was last

177
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,919
saturday or something

178
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,520
we also had two power deliveries this

179
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,120
time we got some build up power with

180
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,400
this um

181
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,880
fetching pink generator which broke

182
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,720
and um

183
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,319
twice

184
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:07,039
and uh and um and some other stuff some

185
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:08,240
diesel

186
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,000
this this is the fluids again oh god

187
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,919
there's another spider

188
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:13,039
um

189
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,000
i didn't know what you were talking

190
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,199
about with these spiders that's the

191
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,080
third one um

192
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
and uh yeah so we got that that that

193
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,680
arrived last wednesday and uh

194
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,440
gave us enough stuff to

195
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,440
run our heated blankets and so on the

196
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
important stuff

197
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,639
um

198
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,080
and

199
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,560
and we also got this hybrid power box

200
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,479
which you may have seen on kind of

201
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,000
beautifully displayed along the track

202
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,400
way down there um which

203
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,319
we got primarily because we need a

204
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,319
backup power source for the festoon site

205
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:45,280
lighting

206
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,199
but uh we also used it for build up so

207
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,560
we can turn the generator and have it

208
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
and turn the generator off and have a

209
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,400
nice quiet night um it also runs python

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,960
it turns out

211
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,919
didn't do a huge amount of hacking on

212
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,000
that one because it's not being used for

213
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
much in during the actual event it

214
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,639
maybe it saved us a little bit of diesel

215
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:06,560
as well because

216
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
it's more of the generators are quite

217
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,680
inefficient when you run them at a low

218
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,599
load so

219
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:13,199
if you can do it off the battery instead

220
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,520
that's more efficient in theory but

221
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,319
that's the start of our like

222
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,479
battery power and renew more slightly

223
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:22,240
more renewable things we'd love to get

224
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,960
into not burning so much diesel but

225
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,280
especially given the prices have gone up

226
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,440
substantially this year

227
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,120
for various reasons

228
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,560
um

229
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,639
but uh it's hard to get power in the

230
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:37,280
field it turns out and

231
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,120
diesel is quite an efficient efficient

232
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,120
way of bringing it

233
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,960
and then our main power turned up a few

234
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,039
days later on this

235
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,599
enormous

236
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,440
not a hiab

237
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,039
um thing

238
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,520
we we're we're a big fan of this truck

239
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,599
it has visited our events several times

240
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,599
before and

241
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
it can lift generators an implausibly

242
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,800
long distance

243
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,039
um

244
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,919
that's where we put the you will you've

245
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:07,520
probably seen the hybrid power thing

246
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,560
during the event and that is just

247
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,720
basically a big ups

248
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
um it's even lead acid it's not even

249
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,960
lithium

250
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:17,280
and then we did an increased amount of

251
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,800
testing this year thanks to all the

252
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,400
power team who entered

253
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,400
a huge amount of work to get basically

254
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,080
more tests than we needed we have so

255
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,840
much data on this now

256
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,759
which we probably won't do anything with

257
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:28,639
but

258
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,599
we have

259
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,840
30 odd pages of electrical completion

260
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,478
certificates

261
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,799
these slides are in a slightly random

262
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,519
order so please forgive me if i'm not

263
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,399
yeah so in 2016 we had a bit of a fuel

264
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,120
shortage um the photo on the left there

265
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,920
is the first outing of this it's now

266
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
it's now past the statute of limitations

267
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,399
on this photo

268
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,920
this is benny

269
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:58,240
draining some red diesel from the tele

270
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,680
handler to put in the generator because

271
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,080
we ran that low

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
um

273
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,600
2018 we were okay for fuel although the

274
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,760
tanks unexpectedly arrived empty where

275
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,560
they thought we thought they were going

276
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,920
to be delivered full so that wasn't

277
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,800
terribly handy this year

278
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,320
oh well

279
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,519
um

280
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,200
we bought a lot of diesel basically we

281
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,120
increased the we've increased the length

282
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,480
of the event by the day we've increased

283
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,000
the build up that means we have to turn

284
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,360
the generators on earlier we've got one

285
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,800
more generator than we have previously

286
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,360
we've got four grids on site this time

287
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,160
um

288
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,760
and that means that

289
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:33,440
we have more generators running at lower

290
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,080
load drinking more fuel it's about 300

291
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,320
quids worth of diesel a day just to run

292
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,160
those generators at idle

293
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,360
um

294
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,240
and

295
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
so

296
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
that was a fuel delivery of

297
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,040
6 000 liters that was about and then we

298
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,040
got another four thousand

299
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,560
so um

300
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,320
there's about 16 000 pounds worth of

301
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,200
diesel i think including that um

302
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,200
because we pay road prices for it now

303
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,959
thanks to um thanks to the government

304
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,959
very kindly changing the law while

305
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,880
diesel prices were going up

306
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,640
um

307
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,760
so

308
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,360
i think we're good the power hasn't gone

309
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,839
out yet i i think we we we rather

310
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,000
overestimated the the amount of diesel

311
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,040
we'd need to run the generators so

312
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,720
we didn't end up with a diesel shortage

313
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,399
but we did end up with a lot of time

314
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,000
faffing about with spreadsheets and

315
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,279
trying to work out

316
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:25,600
whether we would have a diesel shortage

317
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,079
um which is surprisingly hard we broke a

318
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:29,600
few generators

319
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,720
or rather they broke themselves um the

320
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,040
fetching pink one uh broke while i was

321
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,599
having a shower

322
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,519
and then when we turned it on again it

323
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:42,320
would not sustain the correct voltage so

324
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,160
that's going back hopefully we'll get a

325
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,680
new replacement tomorrow because we'll

326
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,279
need it and then the other one the

327
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,440
alternator cable fell off which was not

328
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,839
terribly useful

329
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,839
a lot of rcd programming this is me

330
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,240
lying in the field trying to program an

331
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,399
impenetrably

332
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,760
user interface it's just horrible um

333
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,920
we had a lot of trips of these for some

334
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
reason this year which we'd not had in

335
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,200
the past especially given that we

336
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,440
were more fastidious in setting them up

337
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,600
correctly this time but you know that's

338
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,600
why null sector went dead a few times

339
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,279
hopefully it will not anymore touch wood

340
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,800
and we did a lot of earth testing

341
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,040
including of a tent peg i can tell you

342
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,640
that a single tent peg is not an

343
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,839
acceptable source of

344
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,480
earth

345
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,600
580 ohms not good enough has to be below

346
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
200. and finally

347
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,399
we got power monitoring working last

348
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:39,200
scene i believe in 2016 which i was

349
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,480
doing through rs485 but this time we

350
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,560
kind of had the tacit approval of our

351
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,800
supplier to reprogram the controllers to

352
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
enable dhcp

353
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,959
and uh and plug them into the internet

354
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,399
well not directly into the internet

355
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,639
obviously

356
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
so we all of that is on

357
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:58,399
dashboard.imf.camp

358
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,959
and uh i will have to save it so that we

359
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,959
know how much fuel these generators

360
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,160
drink when they're on certain amounts of

361
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,480
load

362
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
least used power distribution box

363
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,040
nothing plugged in most used

364
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
quite a lot of things plugged in

365
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,040
thank you for using 16 amp plugs we

366
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:16,320
prefer them

367
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
um and if you haven't then just chop the

368
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,279
end of a chop chop a meter off the end

369
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,040
of your 13 amp cable reel and wire a

370
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,240
plug and a socket on there and then you

371
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,880
can use it as both

372
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,199
that stands for itself

373
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,560
that's

374
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,760
that do not do that

375
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,279
i don't know who did that or where they

376
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:42,079
did that but don't

377
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,399
i think that's actually shorted out that

378
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,240
fuse

379
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,040
i can't tell

380
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,800
no not good not good at all

381
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,200
um co2 monitoring we also had for the

382
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,600
first time this year thanks to um graham

383
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,760
who is also known for the lasers of null

384
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,279
sector um

385
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,079
we unfortunately uh so we've been

386
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,279
looking at this from a coveted safety

387
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,440
perspective trying to keep co2 below 600

388
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,279
ppm means there's less

389
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,440
chance of covert transmission

390
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,440
that was true in pretty much all the

391
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,519
stages most of the time as far as i can

392
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,480
tell

393
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:19,120
we don't have data for stage b as far as

394
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,440
i know so maybe that one was a bit

395
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,200
marginal but the rest

396
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,680
the high lines on there are null sector

397
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
and unfortunately we only just realized

398
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,240
that these ndir based co2 sensors

399
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,680
are triggered by

400
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,320
stage smoke

401
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,480
so

402
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,079
those numbers are a bit useless but at

403
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,000
least we know that it's below that level

404
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,560
and now the lighting team

405
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:54,639
[Applause]

406
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,639
yes an enormous amount of reading of

407
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,040
regulations and design and testing goes

408
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,720
into the power network

409
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,560
far more than you would expect and the

410
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
thing to remember is if your power goes

411
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
off in the drizzle late at night it's

412
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,639
not a failure of the power system that

413
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,560
is working as intended to keep you safe

414
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,320
and alive

415
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:13,440
so uh

416
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,839
laurie will talk now about the lighting

417
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,930
that's been

418
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:22,320
[Applause]

419
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,639
so hi everybody uh on top of all the

420
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
power stuff there's a lot of us that now

421
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,560
do site lighting as a separate team so

422
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,240
that means we have our own budget and

423
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,600
we've managed to

424
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,480
pull off a few bigger projects this year

425
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,839
so the one of the ones you've probably

426
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,519
seen are the tent markers or pole

427
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,600
toppers around the site

428
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,279
and they light up this year rather than

429
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,279
just stuffing festoon in the top of it

430
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,760
on top of a ladder on top of a gator on

431
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,720
top of some rather dodgy ground

432
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,360
uh so it's a load of led strip some esp

433
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,040
and load of python

434
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,959
put it all together and we get some nice

435
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:56,240
color things that hopefully in the

436
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,480
future we can reuse again for multiple

437
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
uh events

438
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,800
uh of course it goes into a lovely

439
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
dashboard as everyone does with a nice

440
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,279
bit of python uh in future we should be

441
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,320
able to have synchronized lighting

442
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,639
across the site as well it runs on

443
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,120
artnet as well as just being separately

444
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,959
configurable which is what we use this

445
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:17,519
year as we did run out of time a little

446
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,480
bit

447
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:19,600
and the other big thing that we got

448
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,880
working last night is the hillside balls

449
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,320
if you might have seen on the hillside

450
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,000
over on that side last night big rgb

451
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
uh rgbw

452
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,199
festoon array

453
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,440
full of these small little balls that we

454
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,519
ordered lovely from china

455
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,440
renting would have been

456
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,519
many many more times more expensive than

457
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
just simply buying them so

458
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,160
we now have them and

459
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:45,440
they look great

460
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,880
however i don't have any pictures of

461
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,560
them yet because i only finished getting

462
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,839
them done last night so please take

463
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,240
pictures tonight

464
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,160
here it is testing and it runs on a

465
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,240
point-to-point link from the hillside

466
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:58,480
over to here artnet again we seem to

467
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,560
love that sort of stuff so

468
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
if you have any content as well we we're

469
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:04,000
a little bit low

470
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,240
it's 60 pixels by 19 pixels so not the

471
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,759
biggest thing in the world

472
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,240
send me a message on irc or try and find

473
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,959
someone like me in the site power team

474
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,480
and we might be able to get it on the

475
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,360
site this evening

476
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
no no

477
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,240
speaking of that networking

478
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:29,920
[Applause]

479
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,680
uh i also am not entirely sure what

480
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,360
order these slides are in now this has

481
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,399
been

482
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,519
quite a few people editing this

483
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,399
simultaneously

484
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,720
um but uh yes a little bit about the

485
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,519
network uh those of you who came to 2018

486
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,399
will remember we put in a

487
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,560
street cabinet down uh down at the main

488
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,560
road where our internet connection is

489
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,800
terminated and then a whole load of

490
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:52,880
fiber all the way up here

491
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
this is what that looks like inside

492
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,759
that's our circuit and

493
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,480
mostly test devices because the fiber

494
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,320
is then patched in on the right there

495
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,920
and comes through the ducts all the way

496
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,680
up to the site

497
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,160
to this uh we found that we'd left

498
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,319
ourselves a little note from 2018 that

499
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,918
didn't quite work as expected

500
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,160
but that was really handy for early

501
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,359
build-up because this was day -8 i

502
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,280
believe um the

503
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,679
uh the splice chamber there coming out

504
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:23,599
of the manhole and providing immediate

505
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,280
internet access

506
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,760
um well after matt had done a little bit

507
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,600
of fiddling

508
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,120
looked a little bit like that with

509
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,799
slightly less lightning than we were led

510
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:34,640
to believe from the diagram that will

511
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:37,280
provide it

512
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,400
so we now have

513
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,120
thanks to some energetic rodding in the

514
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,960
first week

515
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:46,880
we now have fiber all the way to the

516
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,039
very end of the site and we also have

517
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,720
ropes pulled down all the way to null

518
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
sector should we choose to use this site

519
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,720
again in two years time

520
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,559
the fiber will hopefully all be there

521
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:00,640
waiting for us as it was this time

522
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,840
this is what the network looks like

523
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,919
physically um

524
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:07,120
you will see a lot of things that you

525
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,120
can't read

526
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,280
we

527
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,679
we like to patch wherever possible patch

528
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,080
our fibers passively so that no single

529
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,000
decay is a point of failure if there's a

530
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
power outage in an area so when we look

531
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,480
at the logical diagram here which is

532
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,559
even harder to read you can see almost

533
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,640
everything is connected back to the core

534
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:27,520
switch

535
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,919
and only a few things are mostly copper

536
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:31,360
down linked

537
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
and mostly within very short ranges from

538
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,919
their upstream switch

539
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:38,080
everything comes back to the noc dc as

540
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:39,280
we call it uh thank you to the

541
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,200
construction team for building us this

542
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
uh this flap in our air conditioning

543
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,559
hole

544
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,160
to keep all our cables nice and dry

545
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,280
onto this table uh we have two splice

546
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,600
closures in there now one from last time

547
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,039
and a new one from this time that's the

548
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,559
new fiber that goes all the way to the

549
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:57,679
end

550
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,160
and the patch from there into our core

551
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,520
switch

552
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
which is the bottom one not the micro

553
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,080
tick at the top

554
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,200
that's a general overview we've got our

555
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,440
servers down in the bottom left um our

556
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,679
ups is in the bottom right

557
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,480
uh some poc stuff above it some servers

558
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
there and yes the

559
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,360
the not quite load-bearing table uh

560
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,120
mostly for the relatively light switches

561
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,840
and all the fibers

562
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:27,600
this

563
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,679
is a manhole this is the one down by

564
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
null sector which uh is

565
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,320
a new one that we've run fiber to this

566
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:39,480
year after removing many many ants

567
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
here's a typical dk so these are the

568
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,240
locked portable toilets that you'll find

569
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,080
around site

570
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:47,919
this is what they look like inside this

571
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:49,760
one is by an underground manhole so you

572
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,440
can see the other end of one of those

573
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,880
splice closures

574
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,520
sitting on the reel there

575
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,200
and below it a reel of fiber going to

576
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,919
another dk nearby

577
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:03,039
i think probably half of our dks now are

578
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:04,000
served

579
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,000
underground and the rest are

580
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,640
on grass or running along festoon

581
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,520
yes and each one has a little switch and

582
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,280
many many of these were constructed

583
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,679
these go on top of the dk at wireless

584
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,240
access point the ohm light which

585
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,320
up until this event was a very useful

586
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:26,159
measure of whether the network was

587
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:27,760
working in a given area we did actually

588
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,840
have one stuck in the dk down by null

589
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,760
sector which many people decided to

590
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,400
report to us

591
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,600
so we had a little bit of change in our

592
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,679
automation this time for many years

593
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,360
we've been using a

594
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:44,080
mammoth google spreadsheet

595
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,000
which

596
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,640
was from a time a reasonable solution

597
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,159
everything was driven from that we

598
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,600
decided this was the year we're going to

599
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,840
switch to using netbox

600
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:54,960
um

601
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,080
netbox

602
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,760
we didn't have too many custom fields

603
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,799
most of it is stock net box but anyone

604
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,720
who's using that box will know getting a

605
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,440
large amount of data into netbox is very

606
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,520
tedious so we did have a smaller

607
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,360
spreadsheet driving it um i think we

608
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,320
used about four or five sheets from that

609
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,159
but then once everything was in that box

610
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,760
we ran that once to import it into

611
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:17,120
netbox

612
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
and then

613
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,679
that drove everything it drove the

614
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,799
provisioning dns the switches

615
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:25,280
the dns servers and also the monitoring

616
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,919
systems as well

617
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,360
and once it had run of course we could

618
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,799
update in that box if there was a last

619
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,200
minute request and uh everything would

620
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,440
filter downstream so

621
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,039
these are the two main spreadsheets that

622
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,120
we use um this is all the switches and

623
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,720
where they're assigned to which switches

624
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,640
they are how many ports are needed on

625
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,840
each of the private vlans

626
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,679
and this is the other main one which is

627
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:50,000
a master addressing plan which again

628
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:50,960
creates

629
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,520
prefixes in that box

630
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,679
i don't know if this will play

631
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,679
there we go this is running at 30 times

632
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,159
speed so it takes a full 15 minutes to

633
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,720
generate an enormous amount of data in

634
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,400
that box from from those two

635
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,799
spreadsheets basically

636
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:08,240
um

637
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
i don't have anything else to say about

638
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
that so i'm not going to let it run all

639
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,480
the way to the end

640
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,400
and there we go in that box 141 devices

641
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,039
does it say how many interfaces

642
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,520
quite a lot anyway

643
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,840
feeding things like this is our icing

644
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,360
nag viz map

645
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,720
dashboard which has been sitting up in

646
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
the knock looking mostly green all

647
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,240
weekend

648
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
and all of these all of these tools are

649
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
in our github account um with the

650
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,640
exception of ansible that we just need

651
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,720
to make sure it doesn't have anything

652
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,559
any usernames and passwords in it before

653
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:45,280
we publish that

654
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,559
uh that is uh how much bandwidth we've

655
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:50,640
been using we had again a one gig link

656
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,640
uh thanks to skyconnect for sponsoring

657
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,559
that

658
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,200
it was uh it was mostly

659
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,880
mostly okay thank you very much for

660
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,880
being considerate um

661
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,960
for the most part

662
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,360
that is a flat line at one gigabit

663
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,600
but again thank you for

664
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,440
stopping when we asked you to stop and

665
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,840
many thanks to the people who emailed in

666
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,919
asking to do a thing that would use a

667
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,600
lot of bandwidth and didn't when we

668
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,360
asked them not to so thank you for being

669
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,200
considerate

670
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,520
um

671
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,080
no thanks for for this this is someone

672
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,159
uh tripping on a fiber and dragging it

673
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,640
at least five meters uh so that all of

674
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
the slack and the actual fiber was

675
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,000
pulled right out of the switch leaving

676
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,840
just the the connector this is actually

677
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,320
not just a network down issue this is a

678
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,600
safety issue because a a very very thin

679
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,760
strand of glass fiber is quite dangerous

680
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,799
if you get it in your skin

681
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,760
other than that the most interesting

682
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
thing that happened this weekend was a

683
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,400
power cut which didn't really affect the

684
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,679
site well it didn't affect the site

685
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,120
because we're all on generators but it

686
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,360
did affect the street cabinet um we have

687
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:59,360
a ups down there

688
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,080
so

689
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,559
the circuit from our provider goes into

690
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,200
an nte device a

691
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
demarcation device which fortunately has

692
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,440
two power supplies one on the mains one

693
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,360
on the ups so we got early notice of

694
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:13,919
this but it turns out that

695
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,320
ups are very hard to calibrate if they

696
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,200
have 0.0 percent load so there was a bit

697
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,760
of a panic not knowing how long the

698
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,600
power cut was going to last and how long

699
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,000
the ups would last um

700
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,520
i think we were probably going to be

701
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,080
okay for about three hours but um just

702
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
in case here's another ups

703
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,679
and and just in case here's a

704
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:37,279
telehandler bringing your generator down

705
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,600
from the site

706
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,720
uh we did actually win that race but

707
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,039
only by about five minutes impressively

708
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,080
uh according to western power's website

709
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,080
uh even though it only affected 300

710
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,919
properties it was back within 45 minutes

711
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:02,640
we were back within 40.

712
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:05,520
not not bragging

713
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,960
um

714
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
and i'll pass over now to ak to talk a

715
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,080
little bit about the wi-fi and some of

716
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,810
the logistical issues we've had

717
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:19,329
[Applause]

718
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:22,000
hi

719
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,120
so um

720
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
across the event we've seen about almost

721
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,120
11 000 unique devices on the network

722
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,559
which is about

723
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:35,919
3.6 device per visitor assuming around 3

724
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:38,320
000 visitors

725
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,640
5 and a half thousand devices of those

726
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,679
were smart devices smartphones and

727
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:45,510
tablets and such

728
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,640
[Music]

729
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,320
3100 esps so those are the expressive

730
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,000
devices which are

731
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,480
the chipset is also that's being used in

732
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,080
the batch and around

733
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,360
1800

734
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,279
workstation laptops etc

735
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
and this was on the wireless

736
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:08,479
and wired network by the way

737
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,360
for the wireless network uh we've seen a

738
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:15,039
peak of about 3000 wi-fi clients

739
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:17,600
and this was across

740
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:18,960
97

741
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,679
82 11 ac access points

742
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:23,039
from aruba

743
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:27,360
and the peak of traffic was around 750

744
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,639
megabits of traffic

745
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:35,600
something different of than wi-fi is the

746
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
logistical situation we had to go

747
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,200
through to get all the

748
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,840
equipment from the netherlands and

749
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,080
germany to um

750
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,919
to the uk so and that's because of the

751
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:50,720
changed regulation situation with the

752
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,279
united kingdom and because of this we

753
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,320
needed to apply for a

754
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,120
what

755
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
what we call an attack carnet

756
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,600
or this is a sort of

757
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,719
passport for goods

758
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:09,440
so we had to apply this to the

759
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,600
local dutch chamber of commerce or

760
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,279
camera from cope handle portal

761
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:18,159
and then once we've got this carnet we

762
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:21,679
needed to use a rather expensive career

763
00:27:21,679 --> 00:27:23,919
to get all the equipment

764
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,440
into the country

765
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,120
and pellet shipment was not really an

766
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,919
option for this because it would

767
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:32,960
probably take too long

768
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,600
so with this camera from copepundel

769
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,559
website we run into some quirks

770
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,200
so one of them is that we in the portal

771
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,600
portal we could only

772
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:46,640
have a list of 45 lines but we needed

773
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,480
300.

774
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,919
uh and

775
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,840
then we could maybe group

776
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:53,279
um

777
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,760
yeah our items we had on a port product

778
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:56,960
basis

779
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,799
but then we ran into a limitation where

780
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,320
we could have maximum 255 characters of

781
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:04,720
serial numbers in this list

782
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,720
so this was a bit interesting so after

783
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,559
some contact with the camera from

784
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,760
copepondel

785
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,600
we found a workaround and that was that

786
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,320
we

787
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,640
could upload some custom pdf um which in

788
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,320
a specific format

789
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:21,520
and then we just put in a like general

790
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:22,799
number of

791
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,640
we had some telecommunications equipment

792
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,720
so many kilos so many

793
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:28,880
uh this value and then it

794
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,279
worked and they accepted it and shipped

795
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,840
the carnet in the same day so

796
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,080
in the end it worked out fine but the

797
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:38,159
the hurdles we had to jump through are a

798
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,120
bit

799
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,639
inconvenient so to say

800
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,039
and we'll pass it on to

801
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,559
logistics

802
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:47,970
okay

803
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:54,480
[Applause]

804
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,320
yeah speaking of logistics the sheer

805
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,720
amount of stuff that has to get here at

806
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,320
the right time and get to the right

807
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,360
amount of at the right place on the site

808
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,120
and then off again at the end is is

809
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:07,440
staggering um so i'll hand over now to

810
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:11,150
pes to talk a little bit about logistics

811
00:29:11,150 --> 00:29:17,120
[Applause]

812
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:19,520
hiya i'm pez head of our logistics team

813
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,279
a team that consisted of just me on

814
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,360
sites until one day before build please

815
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,559
volunteer

816
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,120
uh it turns out the field starts quite

817
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,360
empty everything you see around you has

818
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,760
been delivered and most of it has come

819
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,760
through the logistics team all the stuff

820
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,760
you've seen on the previous slides uh

821
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,880
from the

822
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,720
the furniture the bathrooms the showers

823
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,440
the big top the beer all the plants

824
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,159
the club mate has all come through the

825
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,679
team and we've had to position it on

826
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,000
site liaison or different suppliers and

827
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,559
get things the way they needed to be

828
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:52,880
we've accepted a truly ludicrous amount

829
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,520
of deliveries and

830
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,120
worked individually with over 75

831
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,919
different

832
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:00,159
suppliers in the logistics tent we've

833
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:02,880
had over 400 individual packages come

834
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,640
into and out of the tent over the course

835
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
of the event and i'm just going to call

836
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
out some of my personal favorites which

837
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,200
include a 46 parcel amazon delivery

838
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,440
which went all the way to null sector it

839
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,679
was the delivery driver's entire route

840
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,600
he came here dropped of everything that

841
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,000
was it done

842
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:27,760
uh there was an entire tesco van of milk

843
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,360
for weight limit reasons they're only

844
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,039
allowed to put four bottles of milk in

845
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:33,520
each pallet so the entire van was just

846
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,360
our milk nothing else she was also

847
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,919
clocking off afterwards

848
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:39,360
uh all of the wood chips you've seen

849
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,039
around sight which has been magically

850
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,200
appearing or ever mud is it's not magic

851
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,200
the team helps but uh it's been a lot of

852
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,279
effort getting that distributed and my

853
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:49,360
personal favorite our firewood supplier

854
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,120
who delivered all of our firewood and

855
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
rang me an hour before he was supposed

856
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,799
to deliver everything telling us he'd

857
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,360
accidentally set fire to all of his wood

858
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,120
and all of his shed so that was a bit of

859
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,799
a disaster

860
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,640
but the wood got here we had wood it was

861
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,960
all fine i limited myself to only three

862
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,320
slides because i don't want to run over

863
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:09,760
so passing over to phones

864
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,760
yes it turns out that if your amazon app

865
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,600
is telling you the driver is eight stops

866
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,840
away the other seven stops are actually

867
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,279
different teams have used a slightly

868
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,640
different address for the site

869
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:28,640
so we were graced again this year with

870
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,399
the marvellous phone network i hope you

871
00:31:30,399 --> 00:31:32,399
all used it uh there was of course dex

872
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,559
and uh

873
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:36,960
sip but also an orga phone system and

874
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,930
here's um to talk about that

875
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:42,159
[Applause]

876
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:43,440
thank you

877
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:46,320
so yes uh my name sam i um head up the

878
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,440
poc phone operations team um so a bit of

879
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,799
the the couple other guys from event

880
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:51,840
phone who've been able to help they've

881
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:54,080
already headed back to germany but um we

882
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,120
had deployed 38 decked antennas they

883
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,799
look much like the wireless access

884
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,000
points but they're a bit flatter and

885
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,240
have four leds on them um that's the

886
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
only real difference you can spot we

887
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,240
also deployed 35 sip phones so pretty

888
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,039
much every tent had a wired zip phone um

889
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:11,519
i also staged 35 sip phones in my office

890
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:13,519
at home two weeks ago

891
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,360
with a lot of cables

892
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,240
um

893
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,840
54 pots phones the the wired uh dial up

894
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,840
the old-fashioned kind of you know

895
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,159
analog twisted pair copper that matthew

896
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,880
did um he had those devices we also had

897
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,640
two um dual mode gsm lte cells on site

898
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,799
which you may or may not have noticed um

899
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,760
and i'll talk a little bit about that

900
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,320
later and we also got wi-fi calling

901
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,640
working which was a sort of park knock

902
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:40,480
thing because phones are just ip these

903
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,279
days

904
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,960
but we we managed to do that thursday

905
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,200
with a bit of hackery

906
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,559
um a few cool stats so we had 390 deck

907
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:51,440
devices on the network uh 250 sip 54

908
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,720
pots

909
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,200
16 700 calls

910
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,799
internally through the system which is

911
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,320
quite a lot for that so people some

912
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,679
people must have just been sat there

913
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,120
like yeah

914
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,200
dialing with it um we also deployed a

915
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,360
jam bones server which is a like a your

916
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,840
own private programmable twilio type

917
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,360
service um so if you build created

918
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,760
applications into total 69 applications

919
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,200
on that but half of those are probably

920
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:15,039
my workshop um

921
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,000
846 calls so some of the the 555 numbers

922
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,080
you saw around like you could call

923
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,000
matt's booty call app and and things

924
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:23,200
like that there were some cards

925
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,240
distributed um 555 duck if you haven't

926
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:29,360
tried it by the way just

927
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,320
uh

928
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,399
this was yeah the wi-fi calling um so

929
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,679
previously as you may have noticed wi-fi

930
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,679
calling didn't work mainly because we

931
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:37,919
have a german ip range and the uk

932
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:39,360
carriers think you're in germany and

933
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,799
won't let you use wi-fi calling when you

934
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,000
were bored

935
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:42,880
so

936
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,399
we tunneled all the traffic for wi-fi

937
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:47,440
calling back um through an l2tp tunnel

938
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,200
to my isp

939
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,440
and currently all of your carriers think

940
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,159
you're at my house

941
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:01,399
so yeah

942
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:05,039
290 2983

943
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,960
unique ip addresses which i think should

944
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,399
be pretty much a unique mobile if

945
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:10,399
they've attached to the wi-fi um

946
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,159
so that's yeah the number of phones not

947
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:13,599
a lot of traffic though or in terms of

948
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:15,119
volumes i mean it's you know it's voice

949
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:17,040
calls it was we were doing that's a

950
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:19,918
daily um 600 megabytes a day transferred

951
00:34:19,918 --> 00:34:21,760
over that link and it was you know a few

952
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,918
hundred kilobits a second um but it

953
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:26,239
makes it quite useful

954
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,839
uh the cellular stats so they say the

955
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:29,239
phones that connected

956
00:34:29,239 --> 00:34:32,879
3400 odd unique sim cards connected to

957
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:34,480
our mobile network with that rough

958
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:37,839
breakdown of different carriers

959
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:42,199
so yeah 720 calls and over the 4g about

960
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:47,119
27 gigabytes up and down of data over 4g

961
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,359
uh and you may have had an sms saying

962
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:51,359
you were in jersey um

963
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,679
it's complicated um i can explain it

964
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,199
more lately if you're interested but if

965
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,719
i'm in the bar but if you did if you

966
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:58,640
could forward the message to that number

967
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:00,640
um it would really help us to build up a

968
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,000
record because we can then look to

969
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,280
they're trying to filter those out

970
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,560
because you shouldn't get them but

971
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,560
because of the hack or the way it works

972
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
you do um so yeah if you if you have

973
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,079
that message please forward it to that

974
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,520
number we just we're just logging the

975
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,640
content of the text i'm not even

976
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,320
recording your numbers but we can then

977
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,240
build a trainer spam filter to block

978
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,599
them

979
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,520
and that's me

980
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,580
[Applause]

981
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:25,730
[Music]

982
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,960
none of us would be here without a

983
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,960
ticket well i i hope no one's here

984
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,800
without a ticket

985
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,440
and here to talk about how the website

986
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,520
works and how it has evolved this year

987
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,320
is mark from team webb

988
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:46,960
i i'll try and keep this brief because

989
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,480
there's not that much interesting

990
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,599
infrastructure we try and keep the

991
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,119
instructor boring

992
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,040
um so uh since 2018 um we obviously had

993
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,599
a massive uh rush to

994
00:35:57,599 --> 00:35:59,680
rework the website to sell t-shirts when

995
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,359
the event was cancelled

996
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:04,960
um but since then we've had uh 1400

997
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,480
commits uh

998
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,800
almost 40 different contributors

999
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,079
uh adding a whole load of extra

1000
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:12,800
functionality this year um so i just

1001
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:15,040
want to do a quick call out if if anyone

1002
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,400
wants to get involved in the website

1003
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,400
just check out our github

1004
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,040
repository and and have a look and

1005
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,400
um

1006
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:24,000
you know on the issues or anything you

1007
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,440
should give us a pull request if you

1008
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,079
want to be on this on this list so thank

1009

1010
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,720
uh

1011
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,839
ian and um robert for sorting out

1012
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:36,640
reworking all the volunteering this year

1013
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
john for the schedule rework john for

1014
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,560
the stage screens

1015
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,040
uh john for the village workshops

1016
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,040
um john for the attendee content page

1017
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,720
john has done a lot of stuff this year

1018
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:51,920
um he's he and if anyone's around who

1019
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:53,760
is happy to uh

1020
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,520
do the artwork he's he did all the

1021
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,760
artwork for the interstitial pages on

1022
00:36:57,760 --> 00:36:59,520
these screens but he would rather

1023
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,520
someone who's confident with art um

1024
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,440
could do that as well

1025
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:06,800
uh the herald interface from sam

1026
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,880
uh wise payments from jay

1027
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,760
um

1028
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:12,079
and then various people did um

1029
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,400
bar training guidance from the wiki api

1030
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,760
documentation

1031
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:19,680
um that's all the new stuff this year

1032
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,400
um learnings from this from the last few

1033
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,280
years

1034
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:24,240
um

1035
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,880
i know far too much about the the inner

1036
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,440
thoughts of kenneth wright now i don't

1037
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,440
use pip end it's not great

1038
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,400
um

1039
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
we're trying to get rid of gulp as well

1040
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,680
um

1041
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,200
and in fact it'd be nice to get rid of

1042
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,960
javascript but there's only there's a

1043
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,800
limit to what we can do there

1044
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,839
um

1045
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,680
one of the it was only a week before the

1046
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,760
event that we realized that um

1047
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,040
the schedule was all showing wrong

1048
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,440
because um javascript's months of zero

1049
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,040
day zero based so we had the

1050
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,480
we had the event starting in may

1051
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,920
uh do use docker we've dockerized the

1052
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,000
website that was another thing john did

1053
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
and it's it just makes everything much

1054
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,119
nicer

1055
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,839
and also staging ticket sales this year

1056
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:09,280
although the website can cope with very

1057
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,800
fast ticket sales it's not fun for

1058
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,800
anyone so we've been focusing on a

1059
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:14,320
voucher system and that just works much

1060
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,400
nicer and it's fairer

1061
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,520
um

1062
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
it would be nice to also stage arrivals

1063
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:21,359
oh sorry yeah this is this is the

1064
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:22,480
tickets

1065
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,000
ticket sales you can see them mostly

1066
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,240
sort of um creeping up with a few a few

1067
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,160
sort of initial tranches where people

1068
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,359
sort of panicked and bought them in a

1069
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:30,800
rush but actually most of the time

1070
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,839
that's not necessary

1071
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,880
in contrast this is this is the arrivals

1072
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:40,560
um on thursday um

1073
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:43,599
the the peak is due to train delays and

1074
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:44,880
then everybody getting on a bus and you

1075
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:47,440
can actually see the train arrivals

1076
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,800
um

1077
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:50,400
if people could just sort of arrive at

1078
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,000
different times that would be great just

1079
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,440
to spread out the load for the arrivals

1080
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:56,880
team that'd be that's that'd be lovely

1081
00:38:57,839 --> 00:38:59,119
this is the

1082
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,040
combination of all the different um

1083
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,480
proposal uh

1084
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,560
content that people have proposed so

1085
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,320
starting off with the

1086
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,640
participation but the massive ramp up

1087
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,160
the end is people adding their own stuff

1088
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,520
on site

1089
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,680
which is great to see we had 561

1090
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,040
proposals

1091
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:16,720
uh in total and

1092
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,560
over a thousand messages sent using the

1093
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,800
messaging system

1094
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:22,240
uh and then just because you have to

1095
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,079
have graphs of this kind of stuff you

1096
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,400
can see the um traffic to the website

1097
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,079
during the event

1098
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:30,079
showing that people check the schedule

1099
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:31,680
at about eight in the morning and then

1100
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,119
sort of tail off and go to sleep at

1101
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:35,599
about two

1102
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:36,890
thanks

1103
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:44,640
[Applause]

1104
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,560
uh i'm going to talk very briefly about

1105
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,880
about volunteering um and how it's

1106
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:51,680
evolved over the years um i don't it

1107
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:54,160
sometimes surprises me um that people

1108
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,079
that people don't know that emf is

1109
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:59,040
entirely not not for profit uh any

1110
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,960
profit that we do make which is looking

1111
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,880
increasingly unlikely this year is

1112
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,599
plumbed into the the following event so

1113
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:07,440
everyone here on the orga team has

1114
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:10,160
bought their own ticket

1115
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,119
we started in 2012 with 500 people and

1116
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,160
our mantra was everyone is a volunteer

1117
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,960
and that worked pretty well

1118
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:22,240
this year we have uh six times well five

1119
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,920
times as many people checked in not

1120
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,839
everyone who bought a ticket checked in

1121
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:28,400
556 unique people signed up for a

1122
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,990
volunteer shift thank you very much

1123
00:40:30,990 --> 00:40:34,459

1126

volunteer at emfcamp.org

1153
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:45,599
if you did do a volunteer shift you were

1154
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,280
rewarded with a lovely meal for my

1155
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,200
volunteer kitchen i don't know if joe is

1156
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,040
here

1157
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,720
joe

1158
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,800
oh sorry behind me

1159
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,160
joe

1160
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,240
hello hi

1161
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:00,880
um yeah okay

1162
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,440
so uh this year has been the first year

1163
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:06,400
that we've had supplier deliveries

1164
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,160
um we got booker set up for the first

1165
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,319
time which resulted in uh

1166
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,480
an interesting um

1167
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:13,920
interesting situation you can see on the

1168
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:16,800
board there if you can notice uh that

1169
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:19,359
every one of those items has a one in

1170
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:22,160
the quantity column

1171
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:23,440
so there's an interesting feature on the

1172
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,520
book of website

1173
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,960
where you can create these shopping

1174
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,000
lists

1175
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,400
to add to your cart later if you then

1176
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:32,160
remove the contents of the shopping list

1177
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:35,359
from the car the quantity resets to zero

1178
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:37,680
which you may not notice when you then

1179
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:40,160
add everything to the cart again we were

1180
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:42,079
a little surprised when our delivery on

1181
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:44,240
wednesday had one loaf of bread and one

1182
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,170

[Laughter]

1184
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,880

1185
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,839
local suppliers including pengethly farm

1186
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:56,960

1187
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,200
fifteen hundred eggs over the course of

1188
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,200

1198

00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:47,440
that he's left the buffet open all night

1211

all through those months before you know

1244
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,880
where we're trying to get everything

1245

um

1248
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,680
one final thing i should mention which i

1249
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:19,280
don't have on these slides which is if

1250
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,200
you were kind enough to volunteer for

1251
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:24,079
our closing shift between 9 pm and

1252
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:26,480
midnight you deserve a special reward

1253
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:27,920
may not remember to give it to you drop

1254
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:29,599
by the kitchen later today

1255
00:45:29,599 --> 00:45:32,760
thank you

1256
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,920
and i think what's happened here is that

1257
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:41,520
i've edited the slides while they were

1258
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,200
already presenting and there is now a

1259
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,200
feature that stops someone doing this

1260
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,920
which will prevent surprises like i had

1261
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,520
last time when will put in the slides

1262
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:51,599
saying uh many uh executive producer

1263
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:54,560
david croft um

1264
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,160
i don't know if there's anyone here from

1265
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,400
first aid who wants to talk about first

1266
00:45:58,400 --> 00:45:59,760

1267
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,880

so we've only got 106 slides to get

1271
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:12,079
through

1272
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:14,880
for the first aid um

1273
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,000

1274
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,720

1275
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,079

1277
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,680

1304
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,440
been really good

1305
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:24,800
some of the

1306
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,040
low lights would i say

1307
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:31,119
cool um is a lot of the sort of slip

1308
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:34,079
strips and falls um that's been our

1309
00:47:34,079 --> 00:47:36,000
bread and butter as it were

1310
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,839
our most serious incident was someone

1311
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,920
cut themselves and needed to

1312
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,880
um

1313
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:42,480
be stitched

1314
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:44,720
so we we were able to do that on site

1315
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,319
the whole point

1316
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:48,960
that we wanted to do was to stop things

1317
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:51,440
going out to hospitals

1318
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:54,079
a lot of obviously we we know the nhs is

1319
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,720
under pressure and we know that

1320
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,720
there's a lot of stress there we haven't

1321
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:00,960
sent a single person off site they've

1322
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,800
all been able to be treated here because

1323
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:05,540
of the people that have helped

1324
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:14,640
[Applause]

00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:57,280
deliberately try to keep the ticket

1341
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,119
price as low as possible to make the

1342
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,559
event as accessible as possible so your

1343
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:04,400
ticket pays for the basic infrastructure

1344
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:06,079
it pays for the tents the toilets the

1345
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:08,240
sanitation and so on and so forth and

1346

we would like to do better um

1368
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:10,240
i fully accept that the network we built

1369
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,559
this year is not the one that we would

1370
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:14,960
like to have built uh it is in fact in a

1371
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:16,880
few respects worse than the one we built

1372
00:50:16,880 --> 00:50:19,680
last time logistical issues of shipping

1373
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,240
uh 50 very heavy switches from the

1374
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:24,319
netherlands meant that we couldn't quite

1375
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:26,319
build the network we wanted we would

1376
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:27,760
like to get some of that kit here in the

1377

uk if your company is mothballing um

1378
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:34,400
switches that are more modern than our

1379
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,319
2000 era switches that we're currently

1380

00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:44,480
