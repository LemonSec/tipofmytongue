1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,599
thank you very much

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:03,199
thank you very much for the introduction

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,080
uh it's great to be back at emf after a

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:07,600
big break um

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,559
so

6
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,800
i can do a talk today on on hovering

7
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,240
rockets

8
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,880
explain what those are in a second

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,279
uh the this is the subtitle

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,760
uh which is uh how to go from a sketchy

11
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,080
hobby project to a funded european space

12
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,160
agency program

13
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,519
in

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,479
half a lifetime

15
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,519
so when you think of hovering rockets

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,040
these days this is what everyone

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
probably thinks thinks of this is one of

18
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,120
spacex's falcon 9

19
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,320
rockets landing on a pad

20
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:43,440
and it needs to be able to steer itself

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,200
such that it can reverse back down onto

22
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,200
the uh onto the launch pad

23
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,520
and that involves uh a bit of complexity

24
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:53,280
so another application of hovering

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:55,280
rockets this is the mars one artist's

26
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,719
rendition i think of the mars

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,039
perseverance lander

28
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:01,199
so to land on mars the problem you have

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,280
is the atmosphere is very thin

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,119
so while you can use it to slow down

31
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,640
initially when you're at a high mach

32
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,479
number when you want to actually touch

33
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:10,640
down on the surface you need some retro

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
rockets there are other ways of doing it

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:13,760
you can crash into the surface with a

36
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:15,920
big airbag or something like that

37
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,960
but this is

38
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,320
this is a slightly more elegant way of

39
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,200
arriving at mars and this needs a rocket

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,600
system where you can control the

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,240
stability of it very very precisely and

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,240
you have to do that without the aid of

43
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,560
much atmosphere

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,360
so

45
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,360
a brief introduction to rockets you

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,880
probably know and most of you know all

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:35,920
this stuff

48
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,159
here already but rockets basically work

49
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,799
by ejecting stuff out the back so this

50
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,040
is this is newton's third law

51
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,479
so

52
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,479
you have some stuff in your rocket

53
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,640
you accelerate it to high speed you push

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,799
it out the back and that reacts against

55
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,240
the rocket and causes it to move in the

56
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,399
other direction

57
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,840
so sorry here's an equation so thrust is

58
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,079
the rate of change in momentum

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,320
momentum is velocity times

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,320
mass so rate of change of momentum is

61
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,320
velocity times mass flow rate

62
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,318
so what v means is that's how fast

63
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,598
you're chucking your propellant at the

64
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
back and the m dot

65
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:13,760
is the rate of stuff that you're

66
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
chucking at chucking out the back so how

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,520
many kilograms per second are you

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
getting rid of and it turns out because

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
rockets

70
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,040
store their fuel on board them

71
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,959
you really need to worry about mass and

72
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,200
optimizing that so it turns out what you

73
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,599
want is a very high v and a relatively

74
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,200
small m dot to get a certain amount of

75
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,720
thrust and that way you get an efficient

76
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,319
rocket

77
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,680
sorry that's a jellyfish um dynamics um

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,599
so um you don't have to pay attention to

79
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,120
this diagram it's just really a kind of

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
a cue to uh introduce a little bit of

81
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,599
the uh

82
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:47,440
the background to to what's involved in

83
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,959
making a rocket hover so

84
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,760
i have a i have a thing here which i'll

85
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,319
explain more about later but believe it

86
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,879
or not this is actually a rocket and in

87
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,959
the bottom here is a this is a rocket

88
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
motor that you can insert in it's not

89
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,640
loaded at the moment so it's perfectly

90
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,440
safe

91
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,080
but that's a solid propellant rocket

92
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,879
and

93
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:10,319
obviously the thrust causes the rocket

94
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,360
to go up

95
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,200
now there's a common misconception that

96
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,480
balancing a rocket or controlling a

97
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,400
rocket is like balancing a pendulum on

98
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,800
your hand sort of like that

99
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,879
actually it's a slightly easier problem

100
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,640
the rocket isn't really uh that's that's

101
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,120
a completely unstable system

102
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
statically unstable so it'll just fall

103
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,640
over the more it falls over the more the

104
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,040
thrust the gravity is acting upwards the

105
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,239
rocket doesn't work like that it's

106
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,239
actually in free fall so your rocket if

107
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:35,680
you if you let go of it it's actually

108
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,200
going to fall like this

109
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,120
and the rocket won't rotate unless you

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,720
do something

111
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
to to make it do that and that's another

112
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,959
example of newton's third law would

113
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,599
apply to rotational systems rather than

114
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,879
linear systems

115
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:51,840
so if i steer the rocket engine this way

116
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,599
that's going to cause a reaction that

117
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:54,799
will make the rocket go the other way

118
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,319
like that and i steer it this way it'll

119
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,840
react back that way

120
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
so that's roughly how the dynamics work

121
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,080
and

122
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,280
what happens is when you gimbal the

123
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,560
rocket it's called gimballing by the way

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,560
so you're swiveling the rocket engine

125
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,879
that puts a proportion of the thrust in

126
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,640
a sideways direction that's what causes

127
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,879
the rocket to turn

128
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:15,200
and what happens is that the that thrust

129
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,040
will cause the rocket to turn faster and

130
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,880
faster and faster and faster so it's the

131
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,798
angular acceleration that's proportional

132
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:24,479
to thrust so that's enough dynamics um

133
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,320
this is how you deal with it

134
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,520
so this is a little control diagram

135
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
uh i don't have a pointer here but on

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,360
the left in the blue box you've got the

137
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,199
an imu that's an inertial measurement

138
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,440
unit so that that's essentially a thing

139
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,639
that measures

140
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,560
what way up the rock it is

141
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,800
you've then got a controller which makes

142
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,280
sense of that data from the imu

143
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,600
and then you finally got some actuators

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,120
which will do something to the rocket

145
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,639
now the one i just showed you that's

146
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,160
called a gimbal actuator but you can

147
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,720
also use cold gas jets and all sorts of

148
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,919
other methods to actually steer the

149
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,080
rocket

150
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,520
that then feeds back through the vehicle

151
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,280
dynamics so it makes the rocket do

152
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,440
something that then changes the readings

153
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,360
that you get on the sensors

154
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,440
and the sensors that you'd have there

155
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,360
usually be

156
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,039
three axis gyros and three axis

157
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,479
accelerometers

158
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,800
so gyros give you rate of change of

159
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,440
angle and accelerometers give you rate

160
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,720
of change of

161
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,720
speed sideways directions and up down

162
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,560
directions

163
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,759
so

164
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,520
this is a little bit of history sort of

165
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,479
how this project started um it started

166
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,400
when i was a student or i think i was

167
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
just moving into my first job also at a

168
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,600
university

169
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,440
and

170
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,520
i was really inspired by this thing so

171
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,360
this is a thing called the delta clipper

172
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,840
mcdonald douglas dcx it then became part

173
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:46,960
of the nasa program uh it sadly didn't

174
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,960
didn't go very far they had a couple of

175
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
accidents with it um which wasn't really

176
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,720
anyone's fault the essential design was

177
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,560
very sound and this was a rocket that

178
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
could take off and it could move

179
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,520
sideways and it could land again on a

180
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,840
pad and it was a technology demonstrator

181
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,600
for all sorts of different things it was

182
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,120
built very quickly in a very cost

183
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,000
effective manner um and it's really um a

184
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,319
good example of how to run a really

185
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,160
quick cheap aerospace program that does

186
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,120
something really amazing

187
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,720
so

188
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
the question is

189
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
so i there i was without access to

190
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,520
modern mems gyroscopes or they were just

191
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,600
becoming available for model helicopter

192
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,680
pilots so this is going back to 1995's

193
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,280
at a time

194
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,199
so the big problem is how you make a

195
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,199
gyro so the rocket can tell which way up

196
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,560
it is

197
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,800
and this for somebody who's essentially

198
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,919
operating

199
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:37,840
uh in a basement with limited tools and

200
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,319
technology is a really hard problem

201
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,479
and i found this article from hpr

202
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,560
rocketry magazine sorry there's a spider

203
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:45,840
right there in front of me which is

204
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,720
great so you can go over here dude

205
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,160
and

206
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,840
these guys in america also amateur

207
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
rocketry people like like i was

208
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,520
they figured out you could buy a thing

209
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,880
from edmund scientific which was a

210
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,280
little tiny magnetic disc with little

211
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,120
magnetic poles around it and you could

212
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,880
put it on a little jewel bearing and

213
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,319
spin it up to really high speed with

214
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,520
some coils

215
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,199
now i discovered in the uk it was hard

216
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
to get stuff from edmond scientific and

217
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,319
i didn't know how to import this thing

218
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,080
and where it came from and exactly how

219
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,400
to get hold of it so i started looking

220
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,160
around for other sketchy alternatives to

221
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,120
this and i came up with this so you may

222
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,120
if you're a cyclist recognize this this

223
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,280
is called a bottle dynamo and the idea

224
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,800
is it rubs against your tire and it

225
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
makes electricity to run the lights on

226
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,080
your bicycle

227
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
and it turns out that inside one of

228
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,639
these in the in the little bottle bit um

229
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,160
there's actually a rotor and you can see

230
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,840
there on the right hand side uh that's

231
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,360
the rotor there it's about 30

232
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,000
millimeters diameter and it's got four

233
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,680
north poles and four south poles and it

234
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,479
spins in a coil to generate electricity

235
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:46,479
so um i thought how what if we turn this

236
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,840
the other way around um and so i started

237
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,000
to try some experiments the next problem

238
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,440
was how to actually get a low friction

239
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,680
bearing and i discovered that the um

240
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,280
android propelling pencil was really

241
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,400
good because it has a little bit of

242
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,759
graphite sticking out so you have a

243
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,120
graphite bearing which is

244
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
self-lubricating

245
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,479
so this all sounds really sketchy

246
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:06,000
because it is

247
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
but

248
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,360
amazingly it kind of works

249
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,039
so there's a diagram of it there you can

250
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
see that it has some coils around the

251
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,280
outside to uh to spin the dynamo disc up

252
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,080
it sits on a little adjustable pivot

253
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,160
and underneath are some infrared sensors

254
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,240
which measure how far away the disc is

255
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,120
from the from the uh the sensors and by

256
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,639
amplifying those differentially you can

257
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:31,039
then figure out what angle it is

258
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,039
and if you put this together you end up

259
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:34,320
with this sketchy looking thing which is

260
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,679
made out of hot belt blue and bolster

261
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,839
wood and epoxy resin and all the sort of

262
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:39,200
things you do when you're budging things

263
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,839
together when you're a student but um

264
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,200
amazingly it actually works

265
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,080
so it's just spinning up there the idea

266
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,680
is it's got those little silver strips

267
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,680
on the outside are detected by a little

268
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,519
infrared detector on the side that

269
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,839
impulses current through those red coils

270
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,880
and that will then spin it up

271
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,080
and i think in a minute i'm going to

272
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
pick that up and sort of move it around

273
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
and

274
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,519
so you can see an example of what's

275
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,200
called gyroscopic rigidity so you can

276
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
move the rocket around but the gyroscope

277
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,560
stays still

278
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,160
and that's what allow how you how it

279
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,519
allows you to measure the attitude of

280
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,279
the rocket

281
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,040
there's one big disadvantage of this as

282
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,560
you can no doubt guess which is because

283
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,640
it's sitting on a pivot as soon as the

284
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,320
rocket stops thrusting it jumps off the

285
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,680
end of the pivot and it whizzes around

286
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,279
inside the rocket which is not great for

287
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:29,760
it but amazingly it kind of works so

288
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,120
this is just roughly what the inside of

289
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:33,360
the rocket looks like um so it's pretty

290
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
old-school so there's a gyro it feeds a

291
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,880
little microcontroller that operates two

292
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,720
radio control servos which then gimbal

293
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,000
the engine around

294
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,040
and here's a a film of it uh filmed with

295
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,760
a potato uh because potatoes are all we

296
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,120
really had back in the late 1990s

297
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,160
so you see it's sort of stable doesn't

298
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,240
go very high parachute comes out doesn't

299
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,560
really have time to open and that's it

300
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,839
but it kind of worked

301
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,680
so

302
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,760
oh there's another jellyfish

303
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,800
gyro number two um

304
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,279
then by this time the micro machine

305
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,680
silicon sensors became available

306
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,560
and

307
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,320
these are these allow you to get a

308
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
solid-state gyroscope it doesn't need

309
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,920
any moving parts

310
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,920
and that really transformed everything

311
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,160
and so

312
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,839
that we then ended up with this thing

313
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,279
see if i can take it apart

314
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:32,959
there's an outer shell which was

315
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,880
homemade out of some fiberglass wound

316
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
around a drain pipe

317
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,959
the little the little brackets on the

318
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,560
side were actually for retro rockets

319
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,399
they're not there anymore because turns

320
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,680
out that it causes it to chase you

321
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,239
across the ground

322
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,640
um

323
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:52,800
so that's the inside of the rocket

324
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,399
you've got the two sensors on the back

325
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,680
you can see they're they're orthogonal

326
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,680
to each other so 90 degrees it only

327
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:59,120
measures the

328
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:01,839
just broken it

329
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,760
this is all made out of model aircraft

330
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,640
stuff

331
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,079
and model boat stuff which is great

332
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,839
because it means it's really easy to

333
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:16,160
fix so the gyros on the back there

334
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,160
uh go into little microcontroller there

335
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
which is a pic microcontroller

336
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,519
and um

337
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,600
that operates two servos here

338
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,200
and eve i'm very lucky

339
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,079
put some tape here to stop the engine

340
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,760
falling out because it's only a push fit

341
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,920
at the moment

342
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:52,720
so

343
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,440
if i turn that on

344
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
let's see

345
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,519
this may or may not work because i've

346
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:08,360
done something to it i made it sad

347
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,920
yeah demo error sorry that worked

348
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,040
perfectly a minute ago but now it's

349
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,519
stopped but uh basically the idea is

350
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
when it tilts one way it'll move the

351
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,480
motor the other way to correct um

352
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,320
that's disappointing

353
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,959
demo effect in action

354
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,760
this is what it looks like when it flies

355
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,519
again sorry about the potato quality

356
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,760
here

357
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,560
is that going to play

358
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,000
i'm not sure that you're

359
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,090
getting any sound on there

360
00:12:46,090 --> 00:12:49,040
[Music]

361
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,639
pick up the

362
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,040
sound from

363
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,920
see that that one that performed a lot

364
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,680
better

365
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,440
uh thanks to the solid state gyros but

366
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:04,839
thank you very much

367
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,279
i've just gone out of my presentation

368
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:10,800
um

369
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,959
so

370
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,480
the problem is if you really want to

371
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
make a rocket hover it's not enough just

372
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,720
to control the uh the direction of the

373
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,000
thrust you have to control the amount of

374
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,279
thrust as well

375
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,360
so you have to throttle the the engine

376
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,399
and um this led on to

377
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
a brief but abortive project called

378
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,959
gyrox iii

379
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,000
this this is a coaxial hybrid rocket

380
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,760
engine with a pintle injector that you

381
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,920
can throttle it turns out though that

382
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,120
you've then got a problem with thrust

383
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,320
factoring you need some sort of jet

384
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:43,920
veins and that turned out to be a bit

385
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,519
complicated and things were moving on

386
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,240
and i wanted to try out bipros

387
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,000
by this time i'd end up

388
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,639
starting up a small company and had some

389
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:53,839
other people around to help me who

390
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
really wanted to

391
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,279
join in the fun and see what we could

392
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,560
make with bits that we had lying around

393
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,000
the workshop so we came up with this

394
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,880
thing which is jairok5 um so it's a

395
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,600
gimballed by propellant throttle motor

396
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,360
and it runs on nitrous oxide which is

397
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,839
laughing gas that's the oxidizer and

398
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,000
isopropyl alcohol and those two burn

399
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,440
together in a combustion chamber and

400
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,600
produce hot gases at the nozzle and that

401
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,199
provides the thrust

402
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,279
and it's got a thrust of about 30 sorry

403
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,440
300 newtons which is about 30 kilos

404
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,040
so

405
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,959
that's the diagram you saw earlier on

406
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:29,279
the uh the control system diagram of the

407
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:31,040
rocket when it was back when it was

408
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
really really simple um and you only had

409
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,040
to worry about the the attitude of the

410
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,760
rocket when you have to worry about the

411
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,480
the throttling it as well and trying to

412
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,120
make sure that the ime doesn't drift you

413
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,800
need a whole bunch more sensors and you

414
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,240
have the challenge of putting that data

415
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,240
together and use a thing called a kalman

416
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,680
filter

417
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:52,160
and that's basically a device that is

418
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,880
able to adjust the amount it trusts

419
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,120
different sources sources of data

420
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,600
depending on what it thinks the accuracy

421
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,000
of that data is and it turns out by some

422
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,360
very complicated math which i'm

423
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:05,040
absolutely not going to bore you with it

424
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,680
turns out that's an optimal solution for

425
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,199
dealing with this kind of problem where

426
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:10,720
you've got lots of different senses and

427
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
some are good in a short time span and

428
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,880
some are good in a long time span

429
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,480
and it's a way of getting that the best

430
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,160
of all worlds

431
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,040
um what the actual diagram looks like so

432
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,480
bear in mind this is the gyrox 1 2

433
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,519
diagram this is the diagram for gyrox5

434
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,279
which is considerably more complicated

435
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
so it has its kalman filter that

436
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,959
estimates its state how fast is it what

437
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,000
angle is it and then it has a couple of

438
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
different control loops for

439
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,560
altitude and uh and altitude

440
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,040
and velocity um and it's got similar

441
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:44,800
control loops for the the attitude which

442
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,639
is its angle

443
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,839
and

444
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,320
that allows it to do something like this

445
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,759
now this is just tethered we haven't let

446
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,079
jarok 5 off the tether yet because if we

447
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:55,839
have to abort it because something goes

448
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:56,880
wrong

449
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,240
it's quite an expensive thing if it

450
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,920
crashes so we have a tether here with a

451
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,120
bungee on it

452
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,480
and this is what it looks like

453
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,519
uh

454
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,560
[Music]

455
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,079
and uh there's actually supposed to be

456
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:45,680
another video in there but that seems to

457
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,000
have gone missing so i i don't know

458
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,279
whether you noticed it drifted off to

459
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:50,560
one side that's because it actually lost

460
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,360
gps lock we put a very tight um

461
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,800
constraint on

462
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,880
how accurate the satellite lock needs to

463
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,800
be in order for it to trust it and it

464
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,240
decided it wasn't going to trust it so

465
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,320
it starts to drift off and then when it

466
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,839
reacquires lock it comes right back to

467
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,480
the middle where it should be

468
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,400
so i think

469
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,319
let me just see if that's all i've got

470
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,880
yeah sorry i don't have the other video

471
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,839
um so i could say thank you to

472
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:16,880
all my colleagues at airborne

473
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,160
engineering who've done all the really

474
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,439
hard work

475
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,520
their fellow nerds and makers like me

476
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:22,720
who've

477
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,039
also got a passion for rocketry and

478
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,559
they've been absolutely instrumental in

479
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,559
making this this project happen i really

480
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,640
it's really an example of

481
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,559
how you can make a start on

482
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,160
something on your own but it gets to a

483
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,679
certain level of complexity and it's

484
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,200
just much

485
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,400
much easier and more fun to have other

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
people involved and also need to thank

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,919
european space agency who've given us

488
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,760
some money to actually start

489
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
playing with something that was

490
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,320
originally my hobby and so that's really

491
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,480
gratifying and the uk space agency as

492
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,000
well who dealt with all the paperwork

493
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
for making that happen

494
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,480
so

495
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,880
thank you very much

496
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,799
you
