1
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:08,960
right my voice is a bit croaky because

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,759
hopefully you can all hear me properly

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:12,639
so

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:14,480
ship versus o-ring well let's look at

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,759
the contestants we'll start with the

6
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,920
ship

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,080
trying to start with the ship

8
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,160
okay thing's a bit slow

9
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:30,960
ah

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,000
right

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,680
last ship it's known as the big orange

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,719
or to give its full name big orange 18.

13
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:38,879
um as you can see it's orange but it

14
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,239
isn't anymore but we'll get to that

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,559
later

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,800
and i suppose by some standards it's big

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,520
but not compared to an oil tanker

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,680
um it's a slightly unusual vessel but it

19
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,640
spends its life mostly in the north sea

20
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,800
pumping stuff down oil wells

21
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,399
normally of course things come up about

22
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,680
oil wells

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,879
but

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,120
oil can coat the side of the oil well it

25
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,840
can all get a bit sticky and grimy and

26
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,600
they need a bit of a clean occasionally

27
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,720
this is what's known as a well

28
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,479
stimulation vessel

29
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:11,119
it can pump solvents

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:13,280
and all sorts of the weird chemicals

31
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,960
down the uh

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
pipes to try and clean things out um

33
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,240
including concentrated hydrochloric acid

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,840
um

35
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
in which it can contain about 800 cubic

36
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:25,600
meters of

37
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,840
hydrochloric acid can be on board

38
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
which is rather a lot

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,119
um when i'm on board work-wise doing

40
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:34,880
maintenance i'm a bit on the deck

41
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,880
immediately below these tanks so i

42
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,240
rather hope they never leak

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,840
um as i said it's not orange anymore

44
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,280
so uh

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,000
it's now blue corporate livery changed

46
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,560
therefore the color of the ship changed

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,399
um but they didn't change the name of

48
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,280
the ship apart from the us is generally

49
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
considered in marine circles be bad luck

50
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,200
to change the name of the ship

51
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,079
although it happens actually quite a lot

52
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,680
um you'll also notice between these two

53
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,680
photos that the rear deck has got rather

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
more stuff on it than it did in the

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,800
previous one if i just go back to that

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,080
one

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,920
you see the rear deck it's got a couple

58
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,200
of containers on it it's pretty open

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
whereas now there's all sorts of bits

60
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,560
sticking out

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,480
um the reason for that is the bit

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,840
immediately behind

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,040
where the crane is you'll see a big

64
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,000
white sort of

65
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,400
uh pyramid shaped lump that's one of

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,599
there's another one the other side

67
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,760
that's one of two silos for large

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,760
amounts of sand

69
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,040
and that's because the other thing they

70
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:36,959
fitted on the back of it

71
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,640
there are three what's known as cat

72
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
fracks they're big diesel-powered

73
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,959
high-pressure pumps powered by

74
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,200
caterpillar diesels and they used

75
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
fracking hence the name cat rack

76
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,519
they weren't part of the original fits

77
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,720
but they were added quite soon

78
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,760
afterwards

79
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
this ship's been

80
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,200
doing fracking in the north sea for

81
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,599
quite a while without any problem

82
00:02:57,599 --> 00:02:59,440
but of course unlike on land fracking

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,599
which is also a different type of rock

84
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,440
um if there's a bit of a

85
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,120
tremor in the ground and an oil rig no

86
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,879
one really cares because they'll

87
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
probably know all about it because it's

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,680
going on under our own rig but

89
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,200
when plates start rattling on people's

90
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,760
living rooms they start to uh complain

91
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,959
of it

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:19,280
so fracking's not quite as new as people

93
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,080
might

94
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,480
might uh actually believe

95
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,239
um but it's not the only thing it does

96
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
uh you can also as i mentioned that

97
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,840
hydrochloric acid it can pump down oil

98
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,159
wells solvents

99
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,799
um and quite a few other things so if

100
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,040
you're hooked up to an oil rig

101
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
this is an example of hose rails looked

102
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,480
at the oil because in very close

103
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:40,879
proximity and it's extremely important

104
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:42,159
that you don't crash into the oil

105
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,840
platform

106
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,040
therefore it's got a slightly different

107
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,959
propulsion system to normal ships it's

108
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:49,120
actually fairly standard for uh oil

109
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,280
industry supply vessels

110
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,319
um

111
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,400
so instead of just a propeller or two

112
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,519
out the back

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,360
and the riders

114
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
on the back it's got what's known as

115
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,640
azimuth thrusters or sometimes called

116
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,280
azipods these can swivel through 360

117
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,400
degrees

118
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,920
and therefore propel the back of the

119
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,920
ship in any direction you like

120
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,680
there's also two powerful thrusters in

121
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,519
the power to allow that to be moved

122
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,519
sideways as well

123
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,599
and the ship uses this when it's hooked

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:16,959
up to the rig in combination with a

125
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,720
dynamic positioning system which is a

126
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,238
computer system

127
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,040
that

128
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,560
has got a lot of inputs that tell it

129
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
exactly where the ship is and what the

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,680
orientation is

131
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,280
and make sure it stays exactly where

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
it's supposed to be

133
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,440
some of the inputs from that altered gps

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,600
these days it's also got a couple of uh

135
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,280
weights that can lower over the side

136
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,280
torque wires that rest on the seabed and

137
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,880
they can use those to work out where it

138
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
is

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,960
and the other inputs include wind speed

140
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,720
uh measurement devices so if the sudden

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,080
gust of wind

142
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
it calculates what effects that's going

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,600
to have on the ship and start spinning

144
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,360
up the propulsion system to compensate

145
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,479
for that before the ship even moves

146
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:55,440
um

147
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
and of course this level maneuverability

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,840
means that this vessel in common with

149
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
other similar offshore supply vessels

150
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,199
etc

151
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
it can quite happily spin on its own

152
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,120
axis

153
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,039
um they don't normally have a

154
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:10,960
requirement for that but

155
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,720
when we go up doing testing occasionally

156
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,440
they do they do it just to test things

157
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,360
so that's the ship you'll know more

158
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,960
about that later

159
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,639
but um next

160
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,560
the oil oil rig well

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,639
not just any old oil rig

162
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,320
um i'll use it to boil regular platform

163
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,880
interchangeably here as people often do

164
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,840
um

165
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
the other rig is actually the ecofisk

166
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,840
complex one of the largest in the north

167
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,720
sea

168
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,400
and that photo is actually slightly out

169
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,479
of date it's even bigger now

170
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:39,840
um

171
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:40,960
these all

172
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,880
oil rigs and the royal complexes they're

173
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,320
not static they don't just get built and

174
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,560
stay there they grow over time extra

175
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,240
bits get added

176
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,960
um for various reasons as

177
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
they did then they're constantly

178
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,560
constantly drilling new oil wells

179
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,280
as the dwayne reservoir they're draining

180
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,639
they're draining the oil out of starts

181
00:05:58,639 --> 00:05:59,759
to run out

182
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,400
they'll they'll drill in somewhere else

183
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
and uh

184
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,039
get some more oil out from somewhere

185
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,120
else but also some of the smaller

186
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,800
platforms here have certain other

187
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,479
functions

188
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,720
this is one of the new

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,759
small

190
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,199
platforms as part of the complex it's

191
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,400
not it wasn't actually on the previous

192
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,960
photograph this does water injection

193
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,400
there are two reasons for that on this

194
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,000
particular complex

195
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
firstly it's to

196
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
provide more pressure into the well so

197
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,240
that the oil comes up easier

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,919
we'll also on echo fisk

199
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,560
once it took started taking the oil out

200
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,560
the the chalk bed that the oil was in

201
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,639
started to compress downwards

202
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,080
and uh the whole complex was sinking

203
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,840
so an additional part

204
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
function of injecting the water

205
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,440
is not just

206
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
to bring the pressure up for getting the

207
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,960
oil out but stop the

208
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,400
oil field actually compressing and

209
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,919
collapsing any further

210
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,840
although i did still need to lift every

211
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,919
pla every every all of the platforms in

212
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,360
the complex still need to be lifted by

213
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,440
six metres of welding extra bits into

214
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,240
the legs on the years back

215
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,120
so we have the contestants so what

216
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,160
happened

217
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
well

218
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,720
the events

219
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,120
are on the early early hours of the 8th

220
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,000
of june in 2009

221
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
the the vessels waiting out near the

222
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,479
complex they have a 500 meter exclusion

223
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:19,360
zone

224
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,960
and they have to wait there until they

225
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,360
get permission to go in

226
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,680
and what once once the

227
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,080
the platform is ready for them

228
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,000
they'll say okay right let's go through

229
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,520
the checklist make sure everything's

230
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,680
okay and you can enter the 500 meter

231
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
exclusion zone

232
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,120
and then

233
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,360
back up to the rig

234
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,440
wheel up wind out the hoses and start

235
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:43,280
pumping stuff depending on whatever job

236
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,840
it is they're doing

237
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,400
so at about four o'clock in the morning

238
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,599
they got permission to stop doing this

239
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,960
second office was the only person on the

240
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:54,960
bridge at the time sitting there minding

241
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:55,599
his

242
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:57,520
his bit his own business was twiddling

243
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,520
his thumbs he then contacts the master

244
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,720
of the vessel

245
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,479
uh i took his term master instead of

246
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,400
captain because that's in non-military

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,160
circles that's generally the preferred

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,319
um they're almost interchangeable so if

249
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,680
it's the same as that's the correct term

250
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,280
but it means captain basically he got

251
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
somebody else in his bed

252
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,919
because

253
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,680
you're the boss in charge when you do

254
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:17,280
the dangerous stuff

255
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,639
and off they went started moving towards

256
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,960
your platform

257
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,560
they fairly quickly realized things

258
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,080
weren't quite going according to plan

259
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,919
first thing they noticed that the master

260
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,240
noticed is that he started to talk to a

261
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,320
small steering correction and nothing

262
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,640
happened

263
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,599
which worried him a little bit

264
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,200
um

265
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,159
okay

266
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,000
i need to fiddle around a bit okay right

267
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
okay i think we may perhaps uh might

268
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,320
need to slow down and slow down a little

269
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,560
bit but still didn't seem to have proper

270
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,240
steering

271
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,920
then when it started started looking

272
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,240
like they're going to run into something

273
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
he used the bow thrusters to force the

274
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,480
bow around and steer that way

275
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,560
at the same time he decided to put the

276
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,320
ship into reverse thrust

277
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,440
to slow down and stop completely

278
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,399
and then

279
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,800
sort the problem out

280
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,560
but he when he tried that the ship

281
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,959
didn't slow down

282
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,720
so he's got a bit of a problem here

283
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:18,640
he's out of control he can't he can't

284
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,080
pull the brakes on

285
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,279
and it's heading towards part of the

286
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,959
complex

287
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:26,880
um as well as the complex itself there

288
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,480
are also two supply ships moored up to

289
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,399
two of the main platforms

290
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,839
and at this point having used the power

291
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,600
thrusters to avoid going straight into

292
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,959
the main platform

293
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,959
they're basically going between the two

294
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,200
which is fine for avoiding the platforms

295
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,880
and the supply ships

296
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,240
but it's the complex as you saw in the

297
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
print than the photograph previously

298
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,240
they're connected together by bridges

299
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,160
which pipe various things between

300
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
platforms and they also allowed

301
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,120
personnel to move around the complex

302
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,560
and he actually maneuvered between the

303
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,519
platforms but he went under the bridge

304
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,560
uh

305
00:09:58,560 --> 00:09:59,760
the ship

306
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,600
isn't quite quite as low as the bridge

307
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,120
so i'll just

308
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,959
so it just set amount of damage i'll

309
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,760
show you what damage later

310
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,480
so that was one of the problems and

311
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,079
so

312
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:15,920
there's some damage for that and then

313
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,440
they realized that even using the bow

314
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,440
thrusters was no longer working as

315
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,800
steering

316
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,640
so they can't slow down they can't even

317
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,120
steer

318
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
so over they go

319
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,320
damage to the ship under the bridge

320
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,600
then they're heading towards one of the

321
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,600
smaller platforms it's actually the very

322
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,279
small one i showed you on a previous

323
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:36,720
previous slide

324
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,959
the water injection platform

325
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:40,959
and

326
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,440
basically they hit it

327
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,600
they hit it at nine knots

328
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,160
which is very fast

329
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,040
um

330
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:49,920
and

331
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,399
they did quite a bit of damage to it

332
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:53,360
including

333
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,000
shifting the entire platform two meters

334
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,519
on the seabed base

335
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
so quite a big impact there

336
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,279
um and

337
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,880
at that point they just hit the stop

338
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,399
button and shut down

339
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,279
the propulsion system

340
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:10,720
and i don't know why they didn't do it

341
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,560
earlier it would have helped a lot since

342
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,240
it'll become clear so i'm going to run

343
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,839
through these events a second time

344
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,600
saying what actually happened wondering

345
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,880
now is what people the bridge thought

346
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,079
was happening

347
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
so they shot the engines down and they

348
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,399
drifted away slightly

349
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,839
one of the supply ships for this time

350
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,519
had been dispatched to

351
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,839
go over and assist them if necessary

352
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,240
throw a tow line on them etc

353
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,240
um but before they did that they thought

354
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,000
no it's okay

355
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,040
they just still didn't know what the

356
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,640
problem is but let's restart the main

357
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,079
generators because the propulsion's all

358
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,120
electric

359
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,440
so that it's got diesel generators

360
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,120
that then drive the electric motors so

361
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,200
the restarted the generators everything

362
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,519
seemed to be okay

363
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,120
then they started okay let's gently back

364
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,720
away from the complex under our own

365
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
power

366
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,680
well they did but then

367
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,440
reversed straight into the

368
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,920
supply vessel just to

369
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,920
just just to put the little little

370
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,079
cherry on top of what was a really bad

371
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:05,760
day

372
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,279
uh didn't do an awful lot of damage to

373
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:08,800
either ship but certainly added to the

374
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,279
embarrassment

375
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,320
so

376
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,920
let's go through the meeting a bit what

377
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,040
actually happened

378
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,480
well

379
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,480
that's a plan of this

380
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,839
ship's journey through the conflict

381
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,519
starting off at the bottom

382
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,440
heading as you can see directly towards

383
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,680
one of the platforms

384
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,479
this shouldn't happen

385
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,800
turns out there were two reasons why

386
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,519
this was happening firstly

387
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,800
the master had

388
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,399
inadvertently not turned off the

389
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,200
autopilot

390
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,760
big mistake

391
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,120
but secondly

392
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,600
against all proper

393
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,560
uh good practice he'd set the waypoint

394
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,399
before they even left left shore and

395
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,839
they're still in port he set the way

396
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,120
points to the

397
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,120
platform itself rather than something

398
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
safely to one side which is what you're

399
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,839
supposed to do

400
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,000
this is why

401
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:02,720
so

402
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,639
that was the primary mistake but there

403
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,120
are quite a few others as i said

404
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,560
previously they then started steering

405
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,120
using the bow thrusters

406
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,920
um but

407
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,920
the problem is he also tripped up at

408
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,920
that point tried to okay

409
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:19,760
let's put the brakes on let's let's go

410
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,279
into reverse thrust

411
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,040
because of the nature of this ship it's

412
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,720
normal practice instead of just

413
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,720
reversing the propellers you just turn

414
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:29,279
the pods through 180 degrees

415
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,720
because the nature of them is that they

416
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,120
perform slightly better in that in that

417
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,480
direction rather than just reversing the

418
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,519
propellers

419
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,160
which is great if if you're in control

420
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,399
of the pitch of the pods because the

421
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,560
autopilot's in control of that

422
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,320
so when he thought he'd turn them to 180

423
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,880
degrees and gave it full throttle to try

424
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,720
and slow down is actually giving it full

425
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,680
throttle forwards

426
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:53,839
that

427
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,440
speed built up

428
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,680
the wash from the bow then meant that

429
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,440
there was pretty much a vacuum around

430
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,440
the bow thrusters so they couldn't they

431
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:05,279
could no longer assist with the steering

432
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,680
so uh that point in which they the

433
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,079
bounce rosters stopped working as well

434
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,680
yep that's why

435
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,279
so they then carried on trundling

436
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,199
through to the water injection platform

437
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,399
which is already said

438
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,720
they hit it at nine knots

439
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,399
but there's a lot of reasons why this

440
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
shouldn't have been able to happen

441
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,880
so i'll just go through some of those

442
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,519
we've already said they set the waypoint

443
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:30,079
going correctly to begin with

444
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,440
minor mistake but mistaken nonetheless

445
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,680
leaving the autopilot switched on much

446
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,199
bigger mistake

447
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,720
um

448
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
not noticing that when you don't have

449
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,000
steering control

450
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,839
mistake but all of this should have been

451
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:45,839
sorted out before into the 500 meter

452
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,199
exclusion zone

453
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
both the ship itself and the ecofest

454
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
complexes radio operator have checklists

455
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,880
both of which include making sure the

456
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:56,880
auto pilot is off

457
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,000
one of the things that the ship should

458
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,440
also have done is to make sure the

459
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,920
dynamic positioning system is working

460
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,040
and normally they would leave it in the

461
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
dynamic positioning leaving that in

462
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,800
control until they get the go ahead and

463
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,000
then they would

464
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,839
go in but they didn't do that

465
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,199
so they didn't realize they had a

466
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:13,120
problem

467
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,760
and also there's a checklist that the uh

468
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:17,920
radio are from what's radio operator of

469
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:19,839
the complex is called includes asking

470
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,639
the ship

471
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,480
is autopilot turned off

472
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,639
and a few other things but they are they

473
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,480
were lazy they they marched things off

474
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,160
on the checklist without actually doing

475
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,320
them

476
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,120
so

477
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,360
that's not good

478
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,399
and yeah as they traveled through

479
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:38,800
the uh the master didn't actually spot

480
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,360
the water pilot was switched on

481
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,600
you should have done especially when

482
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,440
everything else failed

483
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,519
um and

484
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,600
also when you turn the to the thrust to

485
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,279
280 degrees there's a the handle is

486
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,399
going forwards and backwards and the

487
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,639
whole thing rotates and there's an led

488
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,880
tally ring around the outside so when he

489
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,120
turned it 180 degrees you really should

490
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,120
have noticed that it was not going in

491
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,920
the direction he thought it was

492
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,680
but no

493
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:08,000
he didn't

494
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,639
and he just carried on piling on

495
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:12,560
forwards

496
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:13,600
um

497
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,959
and uh

498
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,000
well there's

499
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,279
there's a few other mistakes they made

500
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,480
but i'll probably mention a few of those

501
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,920
later so

502
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,279
let's look at the programming phase

503
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,720
let's look at what sort of damage

504
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,480
happened

505
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,399
this is what the ship looked like before

506
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,000
the accident

507
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,279
at the top of the on the top of the

508
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,560
bridge you'll notice there's an awful

509
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:33,279
lot of radar antennas

510
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,880
satellite domes and similar

511
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,079
well

512
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:41,199
not anymore there isn't

513
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,199
basically everything above the

514
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:48,800
above the bridge got a number one cut

515
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
that part of a ship is because it's

516
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:52,720
traditionally got lots of

517
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,000
things sticking out of it it's also the

518
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,440
highest part of the ship it's

519
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,480
traditionally known as monkey island

520
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
um and basically everything got wiped

521
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:02,000
out

522
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,279
they're lucky that the bridge wasn't

523
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:04,959
just a little bit lower or else it would

524
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,559
have hit the crane you can see on the

525
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,720
back of the ship which is very firmly

526
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,599
attached

527
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,520
to the structure of the ship and would

528
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,199
have caused a lot more damage to the

529
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,480
cross bridge and probably the ship

530
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,760
itself

531
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,679
as for the front of the ship well

532
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
it's four meters shorter

533
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,960
really not good

534
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,120
water injection platform that i showed

535
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,360
you previously yes there you go

536
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:36,480
that's what it should have looked like

537
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
that didn't fare too good either

538
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,520
you'll notice a few of those cross

539
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,720
pieces have

540
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,720
gaps at the end where they got broken

541
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,039
off the rest of the rig

542
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,480
also your platform

543
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,720
um

544
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:50,400
as i mentioned previously the whole

545
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,760
thing was shifted four meters on its

546
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,679
seabed base

547
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,000
um for various reasons this injection

548
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,600
platform is due to be

549
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,200
gradually decommissioned

550
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:02,000
uh over the next two years

551
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,360
it didn't happen

552
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,399
basically they wrote it off

553
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,880
it was irreferable

554
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,559
and um

555
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,320
they then had to the whole complex was

556
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:14,160
shut down until this and certain other

557
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,039
things were repaired

558
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,840
so yeah they made a lot of mistakes you

559
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:26,559
think well why did these people do this

560
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,160
well part of the problem is it was the

561
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,240
second officer's first trip

562
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,240
he joined the ship for the first time

563
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,320
two days beforehand

564
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,600
and he hadn't been properly trained

565
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,240
um that made exactly what was missing

566
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,679
from his training wasn't mentioned in

567
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,679
in the report but um

568
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,039
the fact that he was not properly

569
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
trained was

570
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,559
another aspect who was mentioned was

571
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,320
poor bridge culture

572
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,919
the master was in charge and you don't

573
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:54,840
ask

574
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,039
questions a more experienced second

575
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,640
officer

576
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
and better culture than the second

577
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,200
officer perhaps would have noticed what

578
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,640
was going on and said uh excuse me uh

579
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,440
this is not right

580
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,400
as i've already mentioned checklists

581
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,679
weren't completed

582
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,280
or rather they were the checks

583
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,160
themselves hadn't been done

584
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,559
um very bad practice indeed

585
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,320
um and of course they didn't test the

586
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,080
dynamic position system for entering the

587
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,240
exclusion zone

588
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,520
in which that would have revealed of

589
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,559
course that they had a problem

590
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,960
the echo fisk platform itself well they

591
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,840
also skipped items on the checklist

592
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,679
also as the vessel gained speed it was

593
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,840
exceeding the speed limit for the 500

594
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,840
meter zone

595
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,480
they didn't know they didn't notice or

596
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,799
didn't consider as a problem

597
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,039
um and they also didn't notice this

598
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,559
course was directly towards one of the

599
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:53,679
main platforms again

600
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:56,240
nothing was said

601
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,679
so

602
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,320
not good a lot of damage nobody hurt

603
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,440
though and fortunately

604
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,440
no hydrocarbons escaped

605
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,280
so it's just an insurance job

606
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:09,600
as i said in the description of this a

607
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:13,360
big insurance job well how big

608
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,720
700 million dollars is a lot of money

609
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,440
even in the oil industry

610
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,320
um

611
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,600
so

612
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,799
yeah

613
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,039
a lot the ship surprisingly was actually

614
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,760
repaired and put back into service

615
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:30,480
um

616
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,280
but as to what contributed lots to that

617
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,120
seven hundred thousand dollars was

618
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,120
so we had some hundred million dollars

619
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,840
the

620
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,720
the

621
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,559
production had shut down for

622
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,919
pretty much entirely from about i think

623
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:43,440
about two months that would have been a

624
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,799
lot of it

625
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:46,640
but then but there are a few other areas

626
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,440
that areas need to deal with as well

627
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,120
so the other thing is how much worse

628
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,840
could it have actually been

629
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,000
well

630
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
quite a lot worse

631
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:57,960
um

632
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,360
[Music]

633
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,440
if it hit one of the main

634
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,840
platforms obviously

635
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,159
much greater chance of releasing gas or

636
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:07,520
oil

637
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,880
and

638
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,600
and

639
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,520
obviously human costs as well

640
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,320
potentially the most likely bad scenario

641
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,679
is if they're a little bit higher and do

642
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,679
more damage to the cross bridge

643
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:19,200
there's an eight inch high pressure gas

644
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,960
pipe through there oil goes through it

645
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,840
as well

646
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,200
that lock would all have been released

647
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,640
almost certainly found an ignition

648
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:26,880
source on the ship

649
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:28,799
and there was a big fireball and

650
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:31,120
probably a lot of loss of life

651
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,000
also a temporary feature of the complex

652
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,240
at the time was a jack up combination

653
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,360
platform

654
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,039
it was originally a mobile drilling rig

655
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,240
but even converted to purely

656
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,520
accommodation

657
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,679
that could have had up to 200 people on

658
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,640
it

659
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,520
and

660
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,039
because they're mobile they're not

661
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,320
really designed to take the very worst

662
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,600
of weather because the assuming the

663
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,039
assumption is that if it's really bad

664
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:52,720
winter weather you just don't bring them

665
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,960
up to the up to the platform if it hit

666
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,880
that good chance one of the three legs

667
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,559
could have buckled

668
00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,440
and

669
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,679
well lots of life very large indeed if

670
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,200
that happens

671
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,640
um

672
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,000
so

673
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,080
not good

674
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,000
so those are quite a few things that

675
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,360
people should have learned from this and

676
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,400
i'll

677
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,080
this is a good example of what's known

678
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,280
in health and safety circles is the

679
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
swiss cheese model of health and safety

680
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,480
multiple layers of cheese little holes

681
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,559
in it's all fine until they all happen

682
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,120
to line up at the same time

683
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,280
through things go and it all goes

684
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
horribly wrong exactly as happened

685
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:32,159
in this case

686
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:33,280
but of course

687
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,200
checklists can be annoying

688
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,480
but again

689
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:38,080
if you don't do the checklists you cut

690
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,840
corners

691
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,039
this is the sort of thing that can

692
00:22:41,039 --> 00:22:42,400
happen

693
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,320
and of course the final point is just

694
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,679
because you get away with not doing

695
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,600
something and obeying all the rules does

696
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:50,400
not mean it's okay

697
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,640
nobody's killed at this time nobody was

698
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
even badly hurt i suspect a few people

699
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,240
got bruised when the ship suddenly

700
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,159
stopped from nine knots to zero

701
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
instantaneously

702
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,760
but they weren't recorded as injuries

703
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,039
but

704
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,559
yeah

705
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,080
skipping something it's perfectly safe

706
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,720
there's other things that will catch it

707
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,240
not this time

708
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,000
so yeah it could have been a whole lot

709
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,799
worse a lot of lives lost

710
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:16,640
but because there were no lives lost no

711
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,400
pollution you didn't make mainstream

712
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,960
news at all

713
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,480
not because this information was

714
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,320
suppressed but of course if it happens

715
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,080
offshore most people don't even know

716
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,760
about it

717
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,640
and and uh in addition to that

718
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,200
um people in industry tend not to like

719
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,280
talking about these sorts of things

720
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,480
they're not going to get necessarily

721
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,400
going to get fired if they do

722
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,559
but they always worry about well maybe i

723
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:42,960
won't get offered the job next time

724
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,440
if i'm the one that spilled the weights

725
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,039
well this happened 13 years ago

726
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,760
something i'm pretty safe around that

727
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,120
and i wasn't actually

728
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,200
present on site either i just do

729
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,880
maintenance only shipped quite a lot of

730
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,159
the time

731
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:59,919
on the propulsion system funnily enough

732
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,320
so when the rumor came back through the

733
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:04,240
industry when it happened that it hit

734
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,880
the platform due to power failure and

735
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,159
one of our people had been on board a

736
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,760
few weeks beforehand we were just a bit

737
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:11,440
worried

738
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,559
however

739
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,120
as you now know it was human failure all

740
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,600
the way down the line as is so often the

741
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,720
case

742
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,200
and i think it about sums it up really

743
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,520
um we're not doing q a this at the enf

744
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:24,880
camp this year but if you want to catch

745
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,400
me in the bar afterwards

746
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,159
ask me questions about this or anything

747
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,760
else relating to the industry for that

748
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
matter feel free just wait till i've got

749
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,159
a point in my hand first

750
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:37,470
okay that's it thank you

751
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:44,419
[Applause]
