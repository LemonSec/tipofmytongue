1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,720
thank you

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,559
so i was here in well not here in 2016.

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,160
it was outside guildford somewhere in a

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,840
field in 2016. at emf talking about sex

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,000
robots i just started

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
researching them then

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,439
and i came back again in 2018 to update

8
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,519
what was happening and to talk about the

9
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,439
stories behind the headlines there were

10
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:31,359
a lot of headlines

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:32,719
and then

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,120
i thought well why not do this again so

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,800
jonty said come and talk about sex for

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,800
once again it'll be the third part in

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:39,920
the trilogy

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,200
i mean i'm determined that i'll come

17
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,840
back and do the prequel after this but

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,559
for and i will go with it

19
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,480
so

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,920
i want to talk a little bit about what's

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,039
happened since 2016 and where it's ended

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:53,760
up

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,480
and these are the kind of headlines that

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,840
really intrigued me when i started

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,239
researching this so i'm a reader in

26
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,920
artificial intelligence and society at

27
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,640
king's college london so in the the six

28
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,880
years since my first talk at emf camp

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,240
i've changed jobs i used to be at

30
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,720
goldsmiths so i've moved to kings and

31
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,479
they were very accommodating and they

32
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,720
let me keep the sex toys on my shelf in

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,840
my office

34
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,759
um and they didn't pick up too much of a

35
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
fuss about it so they're very supportive

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,880
um so i was seeing all these headlines

37
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,600
saying things like this is the end of

38
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,759
porn online because the sex robots would

39
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:28,799
make

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:30,799
a reality out of porn

41
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,479
and that there would be real

42
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,400
relationships i particularly loved the

43
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
irish son's headline of robot wars

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,960
i've tried to pitch sex robot wars at

45
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,159
amf camp and there was a negative

46
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:46,000
response to that

47
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,040
um

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,640
and then sex for what could reveal your

49
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,840
deepest perversions to complete

50
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
strangers and as every single person

51
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,360
here knows anything connected to the

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,640
internet can reveal the deepest

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,280
perversions to complete strangers

54
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,640
so

55
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,079
i've been researching all these

56
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,000
different sort of things and initially i

57
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,960
was met with lots of talk like is that

58
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,799
really an academic thing to do this

59
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:08,239
doesn't really count as real research

60
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:09,199
and all the sort of things you might

61
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,639
expect

62
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,879
and i looked at the love that we have

63
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,879
for technology

64
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,360
the love that we have for each other via

65
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,440
technology love that is mediated by

66
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,720
technology

67
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,520
and

68
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
people who love are in love with

69
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,599
technology and i say love but i also

70
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
mean sex but then i also mean love

71
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,800
because it turns out it's not

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,280
straightforward and it's not just about

73
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
sex and one of the things i've learned

74
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,080
over those years is that intimacy is

75
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,879
really the driving force here so sex is

76
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,800
part of it pleasure is part of it but

77
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,640
it's about closeness and companionship

78
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,080
as well

79
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,840
so i've been studying things about the

80
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,040
narratives

81
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,800
of ai and desire where does that come

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,239
from this idea okay um so yeah i've been

83
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
looking at things like where the stories

84
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,400
would tell about sex robots come from

85
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,840
and it's got a really long history and

86
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,000
if anyone heard that talk way back six

87
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,360
years ago

88
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,560
there have been

89
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,400
stories going back to the ancient greeks

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,239
about creating the perfect artificial

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:07,760
companion

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,560
um stories about a woman whose husband

93
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,480
died in battle

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,159
she asked for the gods to bring him back

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,239
he returned he had to go again after

96
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,400
three hours she created an artificial

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
version of him and took it to bed with

98
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:20,640
her

99
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,640
so we have these stories that go back

100
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,879
millennia and of course we see it in the

101
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:27,120
sci-fi that we create today anything

102
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,959
from the femme fatale maria in

103
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,640
metropolis right through to ex machina

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,159
um which is

105
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,120
a absolutely amazing slash terrifying

106
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,720
film that i love and yet at the same

107
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,599
time

108
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,640
have problems with um and uh and the

109
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,879
film her worship was the gentle version

110
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
where where the operating system becomes

111
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
um the perfect companion and then

112
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
decides then suddenly you find out that

113
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,799
the operating system loves everyone else

114
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,000
the same way as well it's more kind of a

115
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,840
again these are all kind of tales of

116
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,519
dystopia so

117
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,200
what is the actual reality that's what i

118
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,040
wanted to find out and where can it go

119
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,200
in the future

120
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,280
and we were seeing all of these

121
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,280
headlines about it being you know the

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,480
end of sex um sex rewards to replace

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,399
women as men can't tell the difference

124
00:04:16,399 --> 00:04:19,040
which i think is very unfair to men

125
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,560
um

126
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,160
most of them could

127
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,520
uh

128
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,880
have we got pictures again yet

129
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,759
not

130
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,880
because the next thing is to show you

131
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,240
what these things actually look like

132
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
i love it

133
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
av issues dj is really cool

134
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,080
so this but so what actually happened

135
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,320
was that the state of the art as i

136
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
expected it from all these headlines

137
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,080
was that there would be

138
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,759
this army of wonderful fembots

139
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:56,160
austin powers style ready to take over

140
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
the world

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,120
and what i actually found was there

142
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
weren't any at all so despite these

143
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,120
headlines saying that people were

144
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,080
marrying their sex robots that they were

145
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,160
replacing their partners with them there

146
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:08,840
was

147
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,080
nothing nor is there any large-scale

148
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,000
project to build them so what there

149
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,479
really is is a handful of workshops

150
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,039
around the world a couple in the u.s a

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,560
couple in china

152
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,039
and they are dole manufacturers sex doll

153
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
manufacturers who are adding in some

154
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,199
automation and some robotics into their

155
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,720
sex dolls

156
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,080
and that's it

157
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,840
and we all know how difficult it is to

158
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,160
make a humanoid robot

159
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,720
it's it's technologically complex it's

160
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
financially expensive

161
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:41,600
it's a real engineering challenge why

162
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
would we even go down that route what is

163
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:44,400
it

164
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,360
about the idea of a humanoid robot

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
as a partner that makes it so appealing

166
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,600
because we know there's already a

167
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,440
wonderful sex tech industry out there

168
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,680
with all sorts of cool stuff happening

169
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
so why do we have to make it look

170
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,360
like they're human and like they're

171
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,360
female because this is a very gendered

172
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,160
thing

173
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,919
there are a few

174
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,800
um male robots out there not sorry not

175
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,280
robots dolls male dolls out there aimed

176
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,080
at women and gay men but predominantly

177
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,520
these are reductive female stereotypes

178
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
that are aimed at um

179
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,240
heterosexual men

180
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
uh so it's very gendered and then if you

181
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,000
look at the sex tech market that's more

182
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,800
interesting and certainly in the west

183
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,960
the split between

184
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
who's buying sex toys tends to be well

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
it's fairly even at the moment in this

186
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,800
country but it tends to be more uh

187
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,520
tailored towards women

188
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,400
so

189
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,639
why is so why is there this obsession

190
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:44,479
about the idea of

191
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
a figure a companion a life-size robotic

192
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,240
partner

193
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,039
still no picture

194
00:06:55,039 --> 00:06:56,880
okay so i had some pictures to show you

195
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,159
maybe i should describe them that way

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,759
imagine

197
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,039
you're

198
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,639
imagining your remarks and spencers and

199
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,599
one of the mannequins is in lingerie

200
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:09,599
and propped up against the sofa that's

201
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:12,240
essentially

202
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,919
it's essentially what the roxy true

203
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,170
companion robot looks like

204
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,840
[Applause]

205
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,840
okay so

206
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,599
where replacement oh yeah here we go so

207
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,840
i've just

208
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,919
this is the state of the art in sex

209
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,199
robots today

210
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,080
um roxy true companion with the triple x

211
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
on the left she doesn't really exist

212
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,319
um she was

213
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,160
weeded out at a

214
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,360
trade show

215
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,280
probably a decade ago

216
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,800
and no one has ever seen a finished

217
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,960
version since that was the prototype but

218
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,639
the the guy who made her is incredibly

219
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,479
litigious so i can't say it's a complete

220
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,599
fraud

221
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,919
um

222
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,080
this the middle one

223
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,400
go to the right next on the right is

224
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
samantha um sergey santos is samantha so

225
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,080
sergey doesn't didn't make the body he

226
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,360
used the body of a sex doll

227
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,360
he was interested in the ai he was

228
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,759
really interested in seeing if he could

229
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,919
create a reciprocal

230
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,080
algorithm so that the nicer you were to

231
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
samantha

232
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
the nicer she was to you and the more

233
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,360
yielding she was

234
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,680
um so this was the goal was to try and

235
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:22,160
give samantha pleasure and that was part

236
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,039
of his idea

237
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,280
um he got some very negative press which

238
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:29,199
will come to you in a bit but he's now

239
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,479
stopped completely and doesn't

240
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,680
manufacture

241
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,519
work on this anymore

242
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,360
and then in the middle is kind of what

243
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,719
is closest

244
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
in existence today which is harmonies

245
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,039
harmony's the real dull x of his

246
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,159
creations

247
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:42,958
um

248
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,959
creation and

249
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,240
she because i

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
do gender them it's easier to talk that

251
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,600
way um

252
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
she is a doll with a robotic head and

253
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,640
they're now working on some movement in

254
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
the body but essentially immobile from

255
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,440
the neck dying can't stand up on a run

256
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
generally like

257
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,200
this is not a robot all right anyone who

258
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,640
writes the robots be going i'm sorry

259
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,320
what part's the robot

260
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,399
but there is an animatronic head this is

261
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,240
actually quite good um i'd play the

262
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:12,640
video but i can't because i'm on a pdf

263
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,519
now

264
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:14,480
um

265
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:16,800
but this is matt mcmullen the creator he

266
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,480
he runs realdoll of his creations and um

267
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,839
we went out there in 2017 to visit

268
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,160
and i was really really impressed i did

269
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,640
not think i would be and yet i was i

270
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,680
thought it was

271
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,839
these are very

272
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,800
perfectly crafted um pieces of art

273
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,279
almost so on one side of me the kind of

274
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,360
angry feminist was getting quite hit up

275
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,200
about the body image but the other side

276
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,399
of me was like oh that's actually quite

277
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:43,440
impressive

278
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:45,760
um so this is like cognitive dissonance

279
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,279
going on there

280
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:48,959
um this would have been the video

281
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,120
because if you hear harmony talk she has

282
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,279
a very soft scottish accent which is

283
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,720
just bizarre

284
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,480
um

285
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,000
uh not bizarre that she's a scottish

286
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,399
accent i love scottish accents um

287
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,399
but bizarrely it comes out of this robot

288
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,560
and it was picked because

289
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,560
matt felt that was the voice that he

290
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,640
liked best and he thought would mark it

291
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:10,399
best

292
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,320
harmony's now

293
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,600
available

294
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,399
in

295
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,880
different forms so basically you can get

296
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,640
the doll and then you buy the robotic

297
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:20,720
head and you can now apparently order

298
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,640
the head it takes something like 16 to

299
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,040
24 weeks to arrive it fits on the bodies

300
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,320
of their dolls

301
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,279
um and that's basically the closest we

302
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,760
have that and a company in china

303
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,000
that makes similar

304
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,839
but much less

305
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:39,040
artistically crafted versions

306
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,959
with similar things both of them have

307
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,680
ai chatbot capabilities so it's

308
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,160
basically a dirty talking chatbot

309
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,680
embedded in these dolls but the

310
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,519
interesting thing about harmony is that

311
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,920
there's a standalone app as well so you

312
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,079
can download for 20 you can download

313
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,800
this app to your phone to tablet

314
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
currently only available in android

315
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,640
fittingly

316
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,920
even though she's a gynoid um and and

317
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,600
you can have your virtual

318
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,200
partner

319
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,800
more on that later

320
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,600
so

321
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,320
what happened after that well um

322
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
apparently a festival of sex robots was

323
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,920
coming to london after being banned in

324
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,000
malaysia for being too extreme

325
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,519
which was news to me because it was

326
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,120
actually an academic conference that we

327
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,940
were hosting at coldness

328
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,839
[Applause]

329
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,920
um so

330
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
this is why i learned never put out a

331
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,200
press release on a friday afternoon

332
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,800
because by the time you get to monday

333
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,399
morning it's going all around the papers

334
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,760
and everybody's phoning you going can i

335
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:39,600
see one of these sex robots do you teach

336
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,800
people to actually have sex with the

337
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,959
robots no and no

338
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,720
um so this was uh

339
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
the love and sexist robots conference

340
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,320
was banned in malaysia because let's

341
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,000
face it it's a conservative country and

342
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
they weren't too keen on hosting it

343
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,399
there

344
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:53,519
and

345
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,040
city university in london wouldn't host

346
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,320
it either um and goldsmiths well

347
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,760
goldsmith's loves that kind of stuff

348
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
so [ __ ] goals

349
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,800
and so i was there at the time we said

350
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,560
yeah we can host it

351
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,160
and it was really interesting we had

352
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,480
about 50 academics and we had about 50

353
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,360
journalists turned up as well

354
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
and it was quite insightful and actually

355
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,040
the journalists got in on the

356
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,639
questioning too so we were all having

357
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,040
this dialogue going around with everyone

358
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,079
getting involved talking about it

359
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,760
um and then we got some stories came out

360
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,320
of that uh

361
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,160
so you try to tell people that it's a

362
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,120
very sensible academic thing

363
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,079
and then you get these

364
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
because is my favorite

365
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,320
so

366
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,839
the top one

367
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,120
um

368
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,440
i have no i have yet to work out how a

369
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,279
hacked sex robot which remember they

370
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,680
don't really exist could murder people i

371
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,399
mean maybe if it was wired to the mains

372
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,639
and it put in the bath

373
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:57,839
i don't know

374
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,360
um

375
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,600
the sector what molested was the story

376
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,519
was the samantha robot story and this is

377
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:05,600
why sergey doesn't make them anymore he

378
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,639
took

379
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:09,600
the samantha robot to uh the electronics

380
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,279
show and said to people yeah go ahead

381
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:12,560
you can you can touch so of course

382
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,639
people were immediately going wow

383
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,440
and poking and prodding and

384
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,040
that's what you do you know that's why

385
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,680
museums put things behind glasses glass

386
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,160
cases because people want to to to touch

387
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:26,240
and poke and pry with things that

388
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
they've never experienced before but it

389
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,440
got written up as

390
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,519
molestation it got written up that this

391
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,160
this doll this robot was sexually

392
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
assaulted um a treasure which

393
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,120
really wasn't the case and he took this

394
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,279
really badly and decided that

395
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,399
that was it he wasn't going to work on

396
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,160
it anymore

397
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,000
as for the ghost moto headline that

398
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,360
actually did come out of our conference

399
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
because we were somebody at the

400
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,480
conference was talking about essentially

401
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:52,880
the problem with ai if you don't frame

402
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,680
your question correctly um much like

403
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,680
nick bostrom's paperclip maximizer if

404
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,079
you give an instruction and you don't

405
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:02,160
properly close the loop and tell her how

406
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,199
to stop

407
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,720
then maybe it'll go on forever so if you

408
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,360
say to a sex robot you must satisfy this

409
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,680
person um and they keep going and keep

410
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,199
going and keep going yeah things could

411
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,279
get messy

412
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:15,279
anyway not a problem because remember

413
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,600
they don't exist

414
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,040
and then we see some more headlines

415
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,519
coming out like um

416
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,600
the the new york times saying oh all we

417
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,560
need is a in cells talking about um the

418
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,600
need for

419
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:30,079
redistribution of sex so you were seeing

420
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,680
seeing these headlines like i mean it's

421
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,240
toby young we're seeing these headlines

422
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:36,720
like what every incel needs a sex robot

423
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:37,600
okay

424
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,399
no

425
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:39,279
um

426
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,199
just no that's not going to work and

427
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,279
actually for the the book i ended up

428
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:44,880
writing about this i had to spend some

429
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,440
time on on insult forums um which was

430
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,120
not a pleasant experience

431
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,519
um but a lot of them i did went looking

432
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,000
for attitudes towards sex robots and a

433
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,839
lot of them were saying no this is just

434
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,079
another cope as in this is just another

435
00:14:58,079 --> 00:14:59,600
way of

436
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,360
depriving us of sex with women because

437
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,639
that's what they feel entitled to

438
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,120
then things got weird

439
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,560
weirder

440
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,399
so the following year i was supposed to

441
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,000
run the love and sex with robots

442
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,560
conference again in london

443
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,959
and you know we booked the venue and it

444
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,800
all seemed to be going okay

445
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,279
and then about a month before how a

446
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:24,079
couple months beforehand i got this

447
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:25,680
i looked on the website and i've been

448
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,360
taken off i've been taken off the

449
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,639
program committee and i've been taken

450
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,320
off the the website and i thought that's

451
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,839
a bit that's weird

452
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,880
and

453
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,440
one of the main organizers who is shall

454
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,680
we say

455
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:38,959
i can't think of a good word because

456
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,519
it's not rude um so his is unpredictable

457
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:45,199
um

458
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:46,560
he basically

459
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,240
he he had

460
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:50,000
done all this and then i kept emailing

461
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,279
him and not getting a response and he

462
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,040
emailed back and said i've taken you off

463
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,720
for your own safety

464
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,079
because we're getting death threats from

465
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,639
extremists i was like whoa this is weird

466
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:00,399
after hearing death threats which we

467
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:02,720
then had to report to the met police

468
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,399
because goldsmith didn't want to have

469
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,759
sort of you know extremist targets

470
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:09,600
so of course the police said they knew

471
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
nothing about it

472
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,360
um and it got weirder in the end i just

473
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:14,639
put out a statement saying this has

474
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:16,240
nothing to do with me this is out of my

475
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,720
hands we're not involved anymore

476
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,199
and they ended up running it in a greek

477
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,399
orthodox church hall in north london

478
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:26,399
where they gave everyone

479
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,360
coded directions to the conference via a

480
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,720
poem

481
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,079
and at this stage they're just going

482
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,079
what the hell anyway

483
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,440
the guy who was involved with that um he

484
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,920
is now inventing a death ray uh in

485
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,759
malaysia so

486
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,440
that was his recent story in the paper

487
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,560
so anyway he's not involved with the

488
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,639
conference anymore

489
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,240
so the conference actually is going

490
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,759
after a few years everyone went okay

491
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:51,440
this this is too weird so they've

492
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,560
brought it back as an academic

493
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,079
conference properly run without any

494
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,120
weird right-wing trump supporting death

495
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,830
ray creators um

496
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:02,320
[Music]

497
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,000
i mean you really couldn't make this up

498
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,359
so um

499
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,119
so it is back as an academic conference

500
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:08,880
again

501
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,559
anyway i wrote a book so i wrote a book

502
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,319
about it and it's called turned on

503
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,079
because of course it is

504
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:17,199
um and it was it was really fun to do

505
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,839
and um the the left and the second from

506
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,439
the left are the covers in the uk the

507
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,599
gold one is the paperback cover but i

508
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,119
really really like the polish cover

509
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,720
which is the red one i just think it's

510
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,919
such a good cover love it

511
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,200
and you can get it in german and

512
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,880
apparently um

513
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,559
the japanese rights were sold as well so

514
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,320
i think i think it's available in japan

515
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,720
but i haven't seen the cover for it

516
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,400
so that was good it's always fun and it

517
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,559
was a really interesting thing to do um

518
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:43,440
and

519
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,760
it you know it's it's an academic book

520
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,520
but it's a trade publication so it's

521
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,120
basically

522
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,280
set up so that anyone can read it but

523
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:54,240
it's got its basis in fact

524
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,679
um

525
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:58,400
but anyway i digress so what annoyed me

526
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,000
about all of this sex robot thing was

527
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,160
this fixation on this reductive

528
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,559
stereotype of a woman's body and i

529
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:05,840
thought we could definitely do better

530
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:09,120
than that so back in 2016 at emf camp i

531
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,559
announced on the stage that we were

532
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,960
going to run a sex tech hack

533
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:13,919
and that we were going to host at

534
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,559
goldsmiths which sent per kevin lewis

535
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:18,559
into into complete disney because he was

536
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,000
about to take over hacksmiths at the

537
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
time and had no idea i was just about to

538
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,520
throw him in the deep end

539
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,120
but admittedly i thought what we're

540
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,960
going to do is get maybe

541
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,720
you know 10 people in a room and sought

542
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,960
some sex toys and you know hack them

543
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,080
back together in different

544
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,960
configurations what actually happened

545
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,720
was that the amazing hacksmith team

546
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,320
indeed whoa they they were just

547
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,080
wonderful they put together this

548
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,080
incredible event they got we had about

549
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,039
50 people in a deconsecrated church uh

550
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,080
ghostlist

551
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,440
right before christmas

552
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,960
um and

553
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
it works in teams of four and five we

554
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,640
got we kind of bootstrapped the whole

555
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,120
thing so we got sponsorship in from sex

556
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,640
tech companies

557
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,000
from lots of different sponsors tech

558
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,520
companies as well

559
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,320
we had musicians artists computer

560
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,080
scientists

561
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,720
materials scientists all sorts of people

562
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
from all walks of life all

563
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,880
you know genders all ages it was a real

564
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,000
wonderful

565
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,080
diverse brilliant mix

566
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,039
um and for 48 hours

567
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:20,559
worked on

568
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:22,960
trying to break out of this idea that

569
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,080
sex tech has to be in a particular form

570
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,240
we've got lovely coverage as well from

571
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,880
the observer and the guardian um this is

572
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,080
actually from the second one we ran

573
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,200
because it's so good we ran it the

574
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,120
following year as well

575
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
um

576
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:41,520
still still using that picture yes

577
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
um

578
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,080
and this was where i would have shown

579
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,280
you a little video so the people who

580
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,720
were at it could spot themselves but i

581
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,640
can't do that because the powerpoint's

582
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,640
not working so we're on a pdf but i will

583
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,000
put it online and people will be able to

584
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
see it

585
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,440
here's more pictures oh these were

586
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,760
guests as well these were all animated

587
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,280
um so i had a really nice kind of

588
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:02,559
boinging rainbow dildo which is kind of

589
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,559
raw

590
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,400
it's not working now what a shame

591
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,280
um

592
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,080
but

593
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,520
these are some of the things that that

594
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,679
were created um

595
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:14,880
so the first year the the winning um

596
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,880
the winning team was lovepad and they

597
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
created soft robotics that you could

598
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,799
place anywhere on the body and if you

599
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,799
squeezed the controller which was the

600
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:24,320
kind of to pump air into it and the

601
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,679
controller was shaped like a breast and

602
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,280
if you squeezed it they would curl

603
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,760
around you it's really lovely and they

604
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:31,760
for them to have done that in the short

605
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,840
space of time was just incredible

606
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,960
one of my favorites was peacock which

607
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,159
was just

608
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,640
incredible so this is um

609
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:45,039
the the motivation behind this was that

610
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,840
you can tell

611
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,679
arizona a penises erect when arise

612
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,400
whereas from vagina you can't tell

613
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,120
but

614
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,039
they took him vaginal egg with put

615
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,760
moisture sensors on it

616
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,600
and when when the moisture sensors

617
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,600
activated a big paper fan opened

618
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,360
i made tweeting noises it was so cool

619
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,559
and i just think that's so lovely

620
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,159
because not just as a really wonderful

621
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,400
piece of art but it actually has has

622
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,840
implications for things like prosthetics

623
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
too which i just think is really really

624
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,200
cool

625
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,200
the following year um

626
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,000
this

627
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,159
one what i call the sensuous shawl and

628
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:25,039
what they call a sex blanket um which is

629
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:25,919
this

630
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:26,720
this

631
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
fabric this shawl with sensors in it so

632
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,000
the idea being that if you're in a

633
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,919
virtual or mixed reality environment and

634
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,760
you see sort of rose petals falling from

635
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,760
the ceiling the sensors will activate in

636
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,200
the shawl and you'll feel them on your

637
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,520
skin so it's about creating those

638
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,000
experiences essential experiences it's

639
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,200
not just directly um about

640
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,120
um it's about intimacy as well it's

641
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,039
about sex and it's not just focusing on

642
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,200
penetrative sex as some kind of you know

643
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:53,520
the right type of sex so it's exploring

644
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,320
and showing why sex is not just this

645
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
sort of penis and vagina

646
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,480
thing to the point of orgasm for a man

647
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,720
that a lot of the mainstream media take

648
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
has been the default state

649
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,760
um and then i love this picture so much

650
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,840
this is by paul clark and i love it

651
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,200
because it reminds me of some kind of

652
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,320
victorian anatomy theater

653
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,960
and that's me lying on a a kind of a

654
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
hammock with these wonderful

655
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,559
inflatable tubes around me and when they

656
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,400
flick a switch the tubes inflate and

657
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,760
give you a big hug

658
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,840
and i just think this is just such a

659
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,320
wonderful thing um and if there was one

660
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,760
thing that you know i would love to see

661
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,440
in the whole way through lockdown would

662
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,799
be a way to give people hugs over the

663
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:35,039
internet um and maybe that's you know

664
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:36,640
the closest that we can get to it for

665
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:39,640
now

666
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,919
um while we're on the topic i just want

667
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,159
to flag a few really cool projects that

668
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,320
are going on in the sex tech space

669
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:50,400
um so the um butt plug io is kyle

670
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,520
michellis um in san francisco uh

671
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:54,640

672
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,440
and

673
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:58,400
he is doing open source um

674
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,960
open source support for

675
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,600
commercial sex toys so that sex workers

676
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,280
will be able to have control complete

677
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,360
control of their data

678
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,559
and he does lots of really cool stuff

679
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:09,600
with that

680
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,039
um internet of dongs is um white hat

681
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:15,440
hacking for smart sex toys there's been

682
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,120
quite a few cases in the past few years

683
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,960
the sex toy hacks

684
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,120
and they've been really good at

685
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,400
going in and highlighting where the

686
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,080
problems are there

687
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:27,520
and then sarah jamie lewis who um

688
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,280
wrote this book queer privacy a

689
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,480
collection of essays from different

690
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,000
contributors um and she's also put her

691
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
her vibrator um on peer-to-peer

692
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,960
uh vibrator usage over tour um so

693
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:42,240
this is really cool as well so there's

694
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,320
some there's some amazing people doing

695
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,799
amazing work in this space

696
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,240
but just to move on to where i think

697
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,520
things are going to go in the future so

698
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,360
i keep saying you know this sex robot

699
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,279
thing i don't think it's ever going to

700
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:54,960
really take off and

701
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,600
what i think is much more likely

702
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,840
is this ai aspect and the ai

703
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,159
companionship so all the work i've done

704
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,400
in talking to people who are likely

705
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
potential users of sex robots who tend

706
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,760
to be the people

707
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
who currently own dolls

708
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,640
often the thing that comes across is

709
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,400
that it's not just about sex it's about

710
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,760
companionship

711
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,679
um and that's a big part of it and and

712
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,840
certainly the standalone app

713
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,679
that realdoll have released would back

714
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:22,640
that up

715
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,880
and um i have a phd student a wonderful

716
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,640
phd student chloe locutelli who's

717
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,039
working on this and she's looking at ai

718
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,679
and sort of post-human sex work um and

719
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,799
the way in which these things are

720
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,000
constructed

721
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,320
um and in japan there's the gate box

722
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,760
which is sort of virtual holographic

723
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:38,960
girlfriend and again these are very

724
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,039
gendered and there's lots of questions

725
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,120
about why is this you know why is this

726
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,360
aimed at straight men what is going on

727
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,960
there i mean unfortunately i think it's

728
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,039
just mirroring a lot of what silicon

729
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:51,360
valley does as well which is you know

730
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,000
tech created by white men for white men

731
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,679
and you know we can't get away from that

732
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:57,520
there's a big power imbalance and

733
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,279
there's a big diversity problem

734
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,279
um but one of the really lovely things

735
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,600
from studying this for about six years

736
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
is that there's now a community of

737
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,679
academics working on the topic so this

738
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,480
is i screenshot this this morning and so

739
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:13,600
there's about

740
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:14,480
you know

741
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,760
two and a half nearly two and a half

742
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,960
thousand

743
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:19,360
papers academic papers on google scholar

744
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,799
that deal with sex rewards so it's

745
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:23,360
starting to get some attention and

746
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,039
fortunately a lot of them are also

747
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:26,799
saying similar things which is you know

748
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,159
they don't really exist why are we

749
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,080
getting so worried but what can we do to

750
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,679
make sure that we shape the narrative in

751
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,279
a different way

752
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,240
and then

753
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,440
amazingly

754
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,360
there was an actual headline that

755
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:39,919
sounded okay the washington post said

756
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:41,600
don't worry about sex rewards they won't

757
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,200
ruin sex they might even make it better

758
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,400
for some people

759
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,840
remember they don't exist

760
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,918
so what's next um

761
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,600
i don't know if kevin's still here i saw

762
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,200
him earlier and said can i say this

763
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,520
kevin but we we would like to host the

764
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,919
third installation the third installment

765
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:02,799
of the trilogy and do um sex tech hack

766
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,559
three-way or sex tech hack manager if

767
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,480
you prefer um

768
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,000
we don't know where that will be and we

769
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,600
don't know when that will be

770
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,679
but hopefully within maybe the next year

771
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:12,559
um

772
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,600
somewhere

773
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,840
i don't know yet um

774
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,279
it would be really nice to come back to

775
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,120
it and look at it look at this again so

776
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,520
the first year we did it based on sex

777
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,600
sexual pleasure the second year we did

778
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,760
it on intimacy and essential experiences

779
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,760
the third you know go beyond that into

780
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,520
things like companionship into like

781
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,760
haptics and touch and all sorts of

782
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,919
things and biofeedback and you know take

783
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,000
the technologies that we have

784
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,559
the smart technologies the smart fabrics

785
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:40,799
the um soft robotics and and make some

786
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,200
really cool stuff

787
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,279
um so yeah that's that's in my top night

788
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,200
i'll be floating around later on outside

789
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,640
if anybody wants to come and chat about

790
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,279
this um in in true emf camp style i

791
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,080
tried to do a qr code for my book

792
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,679
so no idea if it'll work on the screen

793
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,400
or not but i thought i'd give it a go um

794
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,840
but if you want to find out more about

795
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:01,200
the stuff that i've been working on

796
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,840
that's what it is there but um i did

797
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,919
have another slide in my powerpoint

798
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:07,760
version of kind of summary of you know

799
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:10,240
what i learned overall i learned that

800
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
i don't think sex rewards is ever going

801
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,679
to be a big market

802
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,360
i don't think

803
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,799
that we need to worry about that and i

804
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,159
think that we've got other cool stuff

805
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,000
happening in sex tech it's much more

806
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,320
accessible and diverse

807
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:23,120
that

808
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,279
i learned that the community of doll

809
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:26,880
owners who have been so wonderful and

810
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,200
supportive in all of my research are

811
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:31,679
really not what you would expect

812
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,919
i think the media has spun the tale of

813
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:36,320
them being these very lonely weirdos in

814
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,320
a basement with her with their sex dolls

815
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,840
it's not that at all i've met some

816
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,679
wonderful people who have really opened

817
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,760
my eyes to that a lot of the people who

818
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,360
own dolls own them for a number of

819
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,080
reasons and sex is often secondary to

820
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,279
that

821
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,320
um and i've learned that um there is

822
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,320
so much passion for doing this kind of

823
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,640
thing and that people are intrigued and

824
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:59,200
that we you know it is research it does

825
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,840
count as actual research if we consider

826
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,679
that sex is so

827
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,840
fundamental to our existence you know

828
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:07,360
this is what drives our species not

829
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,200
everyone wants to have sex

830
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,960
not but but those who do you know that

831
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,960
it can become a very preoccupying thing

832
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,360
so why don't we treat that seriously why

833
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,880
aren't we giving it the respect it

834
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,039
deserves not from a health perspective

835
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:20,799
or a well-being perspective but just

836
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,200
from a perspective of pleasure and of

837
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,960
intimacy and i think that's something

838
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,039
that you know we really we really can

839
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,520
get behind um and say that you know we

840
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,039
shouldn't make it taboo we should be

841
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,640
