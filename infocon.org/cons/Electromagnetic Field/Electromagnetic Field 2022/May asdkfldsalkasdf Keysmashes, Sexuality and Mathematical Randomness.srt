00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:10,560
Hi everyone! Welcome to my talk "asdkfldsalkasdf: 
Keysmashes, Sexuality and Randomness" 

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,320
A quick disclaimer before we get 
started this topic will include  

4
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:19,760
adult topics such as discussions of sex 
sexuality and there will be some mathematics so  

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:25,600
if that's not something you're interested in 
please leave? Also this is the first time I've  

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,840
ever given a talk at a conference so I'm probably 
gonna mess up and I'm a little bit nervous.

7
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,720
My phone just locked sorry...

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,760
So yeah, cool, let's get started. Who am I?

9
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,120
I am Goat or May. I'm Goat on 
mastodon, I am @U_1F410 on Twitter,  

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,840
I'm a Chaos Communication 
Coven/Milliways member (shout out).

11
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:54,160
I'm a devops engineer, I am queer and trans 
which is my keysmashing credentials - I've  

12
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,040
got a lot of experience - and I'm also terminally 
online which is why i wrote an entire talk about  

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,320
keysmashes. What I am not is a 
scientist. I am not a mathematician.  

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,839
I am not a linguist and these things 
will become very apparent in a minute.

15
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,240
Let's get started: what is a keysmash? A keysmash 
at its most simple and popular definition is a  

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,039
random string of letters and symbols typed out on 
a keyboard or touchscreen used to signal intense  

17
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,360
emotion in written communication. The earliest 
reference that I could find was about 2009 on some  

18
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,680
specific archived tumblr blogs referencing 
keysmashing but i do think that this...phenomenon  

19
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,360
has existed for a lot longer than that online, 
but I haven't been able to find records of  

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
it. If anyone can find earlier records I 
would be really interested - tweet at me.

21
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,360
Sorry I've lost my place

22
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,000
It gained popularity in the early 2010s in 
LGBT and black social circles online where  

23
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,600
it's most often seen. In 2015 the New York 
Times referenced keysmashing in an opinion  

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,759
piece about why parents can't understand their 
kids, so hopefully this talk will help with  

25
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,800
any parents trying to understand what their 
kids are talking about when they keysmash.

26
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,240
In the late 2010s there was an emergence 
of keysmashing on "stan" Twitter which,  

27
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:19,520
if you don't know, is extreme fans of something - 
particularly k-pop stans - which eventually led to  

28
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,520
a form of keysmashing entering the mainstream with 
VSCO girls. If you don't know what a VSCO girl is,  

29
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,680
it doesn't really matter - it's fine 
- it's a specific subculture from  

30
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,200
the late 2010s. They do this keysmash which is  

31
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:41,600
"sk sk sk" back on the keyboard. After this point 
the term keysmash enters the wider consciousness  

32
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,760
with a lot of celebrities starting to use it 
and that kind of leads us to where we are today.

33
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,840
What does that have to do with LG...

34
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,600
[laughter]

35
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,359
What does that have to do with being gay?

36
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,840
[laughter]

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,000
The keysmash is often seen inside LGBT 
communities as a sign of submissive  

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,600
or bottom-like behaviour due to its connotations 
of extreme emotions. On this slide are a few  

39
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,000
examples of keysmashes in situ collected 
from real Twitter users just like you.  

40
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,320
A quick side note, if you don't 
know what a bottom or top is,  

41
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,760
a quick overview is that a bottom receives 
in sex and a top gives. That is a very simple  

42
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,519
explanation and kind of reductive but if you 
don't know what it is and you're here...okay.

43
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,640
[laughter]

44
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,399
Often keysmashes are used to indicate that a user 
is flustered or embarrassed and it's often seen  

45
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,920
along with the stereotypical bottom emoji - 
that is the one there with the two pleading  

46
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:49,200
fingers like that. It isn't exclusive to bottoms 
so in 2020 I made a post, just a random shitpost,  

47
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,760
wondering if bottoms keysmash better than 
tops. Because it's important! So I did what  

48
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,880
any rational person would do and I set up a 
survey to gather data to analyse keysmashes.  

49
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,799
To actually do this though, we have 
to define and figure out two things:  

50
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:07,440
what is randomness and how do we calculate it?

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,840
And how do we define "bottomness"?

52
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,840
Let's start with randomness 
because that's slightly easier.

53
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,079
[laughter]

54
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,800
It's actually pretty hard 
because i'm very bad at maths  

55
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:24,240
but we're going to use Shannon Entropy. Shannon 
Entropy is the amount of information, surprise, or  

56
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,040
uncertainty in a set of data. We basically compare 
the entire possible alphabet of the input - so all  

57
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,080
possible characters - and then compare how 
often they are used in the actual string. So  

58
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:38,560
basically we can see how often 
they're used - a bit of distribution.  

59
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,800
It's not perfect for this use case but it 
does work for these intents and purposes.  

60
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,719
We can also use this to calculate what a perfect 
entropy score would be, so what the ideal possible  

61
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,960
random keysmash would be, and then compare 
them to get a percentage so how random it is.

62
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:02,560
Bottomness and topness. This is harder. Defining 
bottomness and topness kind of gave me a few false  

63
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:08,080
starts. Basically we started with looking at 
stereotypical traits of bottoms but that kind  

64
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,000
of led to this very reductive understanding 
of what it is and it kind of trended towards  

65
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,080
the concept of gay men bottoming which is - 
I want to be more inclusive than just that.

66
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,720
To actually get this data we decided to allow 
people to self-identify on a scale of one to ten  

67
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,480
how much do they identify as a bottom and 
how much do others consider them a bottom.  

68
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,920
This probably isn't the best way of gathering 
data but data collection is really hard, guys.  

69
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,200
We also did the same for topness just because 
it means we can compare and contrast later on.  

70
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:46,640
We also got every respondent to give us three 
keysmashes to analyse to gain an average,  

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,000
then I sent it out. I got 62 respondents 
from the social media network Mastodon. I  

72
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,240
had to remove a few because some people left 
very unhelpful comments instead of actually  

73
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,480
keysmashing with one person saying that
"keysmashing is bad for the keyboard"

74
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,600
[laughter]

75
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,320
and that it is a "very 
unclear form of communication" 

76
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:11,120
Which I would contest. It's very clear.

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:13,700
Okay.

78
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,880
So. Data.

79
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,440
Firstly you can see the keysmash randomness 
as a percentage is mapped against...

80
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,840
...um...sorry...

81
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,039
"bottom quotient"

82
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:26,000
that's the word i used

83
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,239
As you can see, we have a very shallow curve that 
starts low, picks up in the middle, and drops back  

84
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,680
down. These results are not conclusive. Clearly 
we can see the people who have a low bottom  

85
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:48,560
quotient and a high bottom quotient keysmash 
less randomly. Which is weird. For comparison,  

86
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,400
keysmash randomness against top scores a very 
similar curve almost if you kind of squint a bit?

87
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,840
What does this tell us...
sorry, that was a surprise.

88
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:06,560
What does this tell us about keysmash 
randomness and sexuality? It tells us  

89
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,440
that tops and bottoms have no real relationship 
to the randomness of keysmashes. It also tells  

90
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,120
us that those who can't define themselves as 
either strongly a top or strongly a bottom  

91
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,360
are more likely to keysmash more randomly so 
maybe it's switches who keysmash the best.

92
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,000
If we circle back to the beginning of the 
study I said specifically if bottoms keysmash  

93
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,280
better and from the definition where I said 
it is a random spamming of the keyboard  

94
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,400
you might think that randomness is best.
But I disagree, and that's very important  

95
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:42,560
coming up. On the screen there are two 
keysmashes um i'm basically going to ask  

96
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,880
you to raise your hand if you think the right 
one is the correct - the better keysmash.

97
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,120
And anyone thinks the one on the left is better?  

98
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
Okay it's your left. I thought everyone 
was completely wrong for a moment there.

99
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,080
[laughter]

100
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,000
Yeah exactly, right? That one is far too long, 
it's got numbers - it just doesn't look right.  

101
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,553
This one is a little bit more tricky so,  on the 
right again - anyone think that's the correct one?

102
00:08:10,553 --> 00:08:12,400
> It's mine!

103
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,352
Yours?

104
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,720
[laughter]

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,840
And the left one?

106
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:20,880
Yeah same again. It's kind of obvious 
that that one is the correct one.

107
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,120
[laughter]

108
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,720
Obviously, guys, come on! But there are unwritten 
rules to keysmashing. Gretchen McCulloch who  

109
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:35,600
is a linguist mentions this in her book, Because 
Internet, and i really highly recommend it - it's  

110
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:41,440
really interesting. It analyses how we communicate 
online and how it's changing how we talk  

111
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,880
and "net speak" so if you're a fan of this kind 
of stuff then obviously you're gonna like that.  

112
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,480
In her book she references that there are 
five-ish rules...kind of vague outlines,  

113
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,080
so I decided to try and formalise them. So we're 
going to start with going through the rules.

114
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,000
I meant to show that slide...

115
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,480
Rule 1: keysmashes start with "asdf"
This one is a very contentious rule and a lot of  

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,800
people disagree with me but i think it's pretty 
important to a keysmash. The first characters  

117
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,560
prime us to prepare to see a keysmash and kind of 
register it as such, otherwise it's just random.  

118
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,400
By the way this is all with a QWERTY 
keyboard - that will come up later.  

119
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Dvorak users if you're in the audience?

120
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,120
> Woo!

121
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
You can't keysmash!

122
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:31,360
[laughter]

123
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Actually that's an interesting side note: a lot 
of people I spoke to who use Dvorak keyboards  

124
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,400
said that they don't keysmash specifically 
because it's not socially legible - when they  

125
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,680
keysmash it doesn't look "right" 
enough, and they just delete it.  

126
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,120
Which is - it's interesting! To me at least 
and, probably you if you're here but I hope so.  

127
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,520
Most people start when they keysmash 
whether they're left or right-handed on  

128
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:56,560
the left-hand side of the keyboard with their 
left hand. So let's move on to the next rule.

129
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,719
Alternating sides: a keysmash moves back and 
forth across the keyboard - you move like that.  

130
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,335
Sticking on one side just doesn't look...right? 
It doesn't look...it just looks...ehh.

131
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,680
Most keysmashes are written 
with both hands and even people  

132
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,439
on mobile keyboards do this with both thumbs.

133
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Rule 3: mostly middle row.
Most keysmashes are entirely made up  

134
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,520
of keys on the middle or top row of the keyboard. 
I think this is because most people start in the  

135
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:31,280
middle row and when they're excited they stretch 
their hands out. Some keysmash purists do say it  

136
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,480
should only be the middle row and the top row is 
no-go, but I disagree. I think it's important.

137
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,437
Rule 4: mixed case.
No.

138
00:10:42,437 --> 00:10:43,840
[laughter]

139
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,160
Rule 5: no numbers or punctuation.
This one is also a little bit contentious,  

140
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,280
a couple people said "oh if you're not using 
punctuation you're not really excited"  

141
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:54,319
but I don't know. I personally 
think this is an important rule.

142
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,560
So with these five rules we've defined from 
careful analysis of keysmashes we can now go  

143
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:05,599
ahead and mathematically apply these rules to 
keysmashes. This should give us a much better  

144
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:11,520
way of scoring how good a keysmash is and what 
we can actually do with that data. The specific  

145
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:17,040
code that i wrote for each rule is not online, 
currently. It's terrible. I need to fix it. 

146
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,160
If anyone is interested in working on this 
hit me up after, I'll let you know where I am.

147
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:29,440
But basically the way it works is each keysmash is 
fed through each rule. Each rule gives it a value  

148
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,560
between 0 and 1, that is all assigned together 
to get a total score out of five. So, here are  

149
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:39,680
some example keysmashes that i ran through the 
algorithm and yeah you can see it's kind of  

150
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:45,680
what we'd expect. The one at the top is clearly a 
keysmash and the one on the bottom is kind of...I  

151
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,640
don't even know what it is it's just a...bleugh.

152
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,680
So, now that we can calculate the perfect 
keysmash, we need more data. We always need  

153
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:58,160
more data with more fields to analyse. 
The last survey had a lot of issues,  

154
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:01,920
for example there was no way to know if the 
respondent was using a mobile or desktop keyboard,  

155
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,400
what keyboard format they were using, and we only 
can use this with QWERTY keyboards so I had to  

156
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:14,000
basically throw all that data away. So i sent out 
another survey asking for more keysmashes instead  

157
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,440
of asking about topness and bottomness I decided 
to move away from that and look at sexuality,  

158
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:27,040
gender, romantic orientation, as well as ask about 
device type, keyboard type, keyboard layout, and  

159
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,280
also most favoured social media platform because 
you wanna know. It's important research everyone.

160
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,120
I also wanna know if this has any effect on 
the outcome. With the new data cleaned up  

161
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,080
110 records mostly sourced from Mastodon, 
Twitter, and a few Discord servers.  

162
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:47,520
So before we analyse keysmashes I just want to 
have a quick look at the data with everyone. 

163
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:54,079
Keyboard information: it's pretty much standard 
as we'd expect. Most people using QWERTY,  

164
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:59,600
a couple AZERTY users, and i think three 
Dvorak users? So you got some friends! 

165
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
[laughter]

166
00:13:02,151 --> 00:13:04,880
One person just decided to 
keysmash in every single field,  

167
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,840
so I had to delete that respondent. 
Don't know what that means.  

168
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,040
There's a really even split between mobile 
and desktop users which was pretty useful  

169
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,599
actually. And also a very even split between 
touch typers and non-touch typers on desktop.

170
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,800
This is where i learned a very important lesson.  

171
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,680
Don't let people put in whatever 
the hell they want in your forms.

172
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:30,080
Use. Fields. God.

173
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:35,280
Because i spent so much time cleaning up data and 
making it look right and sorting out sexualities  

174
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:42,720
and defining, like if someone put pan/bi or bi/pan, 
I had to kind of reduct it down to one which  

175
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:47,840
isn't the best. I'm not, like 
i said, I'm not a scientist!

176
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:51,360
Sorry my phone locked again...

177
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:58,160
Sexuality and romantic orientation were 
pretty standard, there was a large amount  

178
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,839
of asexual representation. The romantic 
orientation is pretty evenly split as well.  

179
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,800
Like I just said, all those points about sorting 
out data, well they're about to get a lot worse.

180
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,526
Gender.

181
00:14:07,526 --> 00:14:10,959
[laughter]

182
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:18,720
Gender! I spent a couple hours 
trying to sort out the gender...pie.  

183
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,079
But i could not. There were, at the end of 
the day, 62 discrete different gender entries.

184
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:33,839
And the ones on screen are just the largest. It is 
basically impossible to do anything with this data  

185
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:36,720
because it's collected in a way that 
makes no sense. Because if someone  

186
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:43,840
put "male" I don't know if that's cis or trans 
or non-binary just, useless. So that was fun.

187
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,680
Ideally I do want to do this study again 
with all the things that I've learned and  

188
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:55,920
if any universities or research institutions would 
like to fund me? Again, get in touch afterwards.

189
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,520
Finally, social media usage. Pretty standard, the 
majority of people mostly use Discord or Twitter  

190
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,360
as their primary form of social media. When asking 
for primary form of social media most people gave  

191
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,240
multiples so I just picked the one at the front, 
the one they put in first, because I did ask for  

192
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,960
one and they gave me multiple which is wrong. 
It's not me who's wrong it's the respondents!

193
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:26,560
Okay, with this out of the way it is time 
to rank data using the average keysmash  

194
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:31,199
score from the three keysmashes provided we can 
now look at the keysmashes, look at the data,  

195
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:39,760
and see if we can draw any interesting results. By 
the way i've also included keysmash randomness on  

196
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,840
the other side just as an interesting comparison. 
The keysmash score is the calculated thing.  

197
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,800
The highest scoring keysmashes come from 
Mastodon. Good job everyone on the fediverse.

198
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:57,760
Second comes from Slack. Three people said that 
Slack was their primary form of social media.

199
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:00,967
[laughter]

200
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:06,960
I don't know if the kids these days are really 
into Slack or if it's a joke but they only  

201
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:12,000
keysmash a little bit worse than Mastodon users. 
Following on from that is Discord and then Twitter  

202
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:18,240
and surprisingly Tumblr. I don't know about a lot 
of people in this room but I use Tumblr and a lot  

203
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,840
of people on there keysmash a lot. So i was 
kind of expecting it to have a higher score.

204
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,640
Sexuality.
Bisexuals in the audience,  

205
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:35,040
mathematically you are the best. I've proved 
it. Behind that is asexuals, by a large margin  

206
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,000
for this system. Lesbians...quite a big gap. In 
a surprise to everyone, especially me coming into  

207
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:49,920
this research, heterosexuals above homosexuals/men 
loving men. I had to split what that meant because  

208
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:56,000
a lot of people put in "I'm just gay!" and 
I'm just...okay? This is not very specific.

209
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,560
It's fine.

210
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,599
It's fine. it's my fault.

211
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,680
That's interesting. Keysmashes are an LGBT thing, 
right? Well if we look at this data it says not.  

212
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:11,680
It says otherwise. But if we do use romanticness 
as well so heterosexual, heteroromantic  

213
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:19,599
you know... "normal"...we can see that they 
actually have a lower keysmash score than  

214
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:23,679
homosexuals so everything is 
right and it's in its place.

215
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:26,320
[laughter]

216
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,440
So let's look at some issues with this because god 
are there a lot. Firstly there is no algorithmic  

217
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,400
weighting: each rule is worth exactly the 
same number of points. That gives us a bit  

218
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,200
of a problem because some rules are more important 
than others. Which ones? I don't know! Everyone I  

219
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,920
spoke to about this has different opinions. 
Secondly, what even is a perfect keysmash?

220
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,399
Well I did it. I did the maths. But a lot of 
people said these keysmashes look formulaic and  

221
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,600
boring and very clinical and I kind of agree. I 
think there is a little bit more to it than just  

222
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,600
the rules that we have defined. There is a 
breaking of these rules that gives it a real  

223
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,840
certain something you know, a little 
secret sauce. Also it is QWERTY-only,  

224
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
the data collection design 
issues that i mentioned.

225
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,840
Conclusions:
Defining language or keysmashing  

226
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:26,080
is really hard. Linguists have it really rough, 
apparently. Language is malleable and changes  

227
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:31,040
all the time. It is very difficult to define 
something which is almost exclusively online.  

228
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:40,000
And why do we even care how good a keysmash is 
anyway? When we are locked inside for two years,  

229
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,800
no way to communicate face to face like we used to 
all those little micro expressions and gestures,  

230
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,840
this is how we express ourselves this is 
how we show emotion in a way that is beyond  

231
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:57,679
language. It is like emojis and, you know, 
"lol", it shows emotion without real words  

232
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:01,920
and i think that's really kind of beautiful. I 
think it's beautiful, you don't have to agree.

233
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:09,840
Keysmashing isn't just for bottoms. 
It isn't. Everyone does it. Probably.

234
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,440
I'm kind of rushing for time because 
I realise I'm about to run over.  

235
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,560
Take your time. If you're going to do something 
like this. If you're going to take a shitpost,  

236
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:23,840
a joke idea and turn it into an entire 
talk like I did. Don't. No, do. Seriously.

237
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,640
It was a great learning experience. I learned a 
lot about science and keysmashes and linguistics  

238
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:37,920
and now I'm here. Just get a second pair of eyes 
on things try and refine your search method,  

239
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,200
your data collection methods before you 
actually do it or you'll end up like me.

240
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:50,560
That's it really. Before i finish i'd just like 
to thank my partner Kim, my friend Colin and Zaya  

241
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:54,480
for helping me and letting me yell at them about 
keysmashes. If you're interested in any more i  

242
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:00,809
will be at Milliways or the Coven or around that 
area for most of EMF. Thank you for listening.

243
00:20:00,809 --> 00:20:05,245
[applause]
