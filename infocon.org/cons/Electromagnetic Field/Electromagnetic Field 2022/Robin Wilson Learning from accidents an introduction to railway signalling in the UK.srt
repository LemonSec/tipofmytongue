1
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,200
thank you very much everybody so as i

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,280
said i'm going to talk about um railway

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,120
signaling in the uk and i'm going to

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:15,920
talk about this from the perspective of

5
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,880
learning from accidents it's often said

6
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,279
that safety regulations in in most

7
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,320
industries are written in blood because

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,480
they're all based on the accidents that

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,320
happen that have caused injuries or

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,679
death and we're going to look a little

11
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:31,279
bit about how that's influenced the

12
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
development of uk railway signaling so

13
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,760
just to whiz through a few little bits

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:38,160
to begin with um this is the inside of a

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,800
train uh cab where the driver sits

16
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,640
you'll notice uh there's no steering

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,399
wheel so for those of you who haven't

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,460
realized railways run on rails so

19
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,960
[Laughter]

20
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,399
i support in this audience most people

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,680
know that but you'd be surprised how

22
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,120
many people in the general public don't

23
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,480
realize that

24
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,199
um

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,399
so signalers um do multiple things of

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,719
getting trains where they should go

27
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,199
and getting them there safely and uh to

28
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,360
control where trains go they use points

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,840
which are bits of movable rail so here

30
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,280
you can see that you can go off to the

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,680
left or you can go straight ahead and

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,200
the way this works you can see in this

33
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
little animation here you've got those

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,880
two bits moving in the middle of the

35
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
track and you can either go straight

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,280
ahead or to the right or straight ahead

37
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:23,200
or to the right

38
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,600
so as i said the purpose of signaling is

39
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,799
getting trains where they should be

40
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,240
going there's no point if the train

41
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,439
going to london actually ends up in

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,119
birmingham instead

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,200
but also getting them there safely in

44
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,439
one piece at the right time

45
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
with no accidents and no no safety

46
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,200
incidents

47
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,640
but i guess the first question is do we

48
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
really need a signaler at all and the

49
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,799
early railways didn't have signals they

50
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,640
were very simple railways they were very

51
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,399
small railways they were very slow

52
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,320
railways so if you don't have many

53
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,159
trains they're not really likely to very

54
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:54,399
likely did each other and if they're

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,000
going really slowly then if they do hit

56
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,960
each other they're not going to cause

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,439
any damage so maybe you don't need a

58
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
signaler and if you're going to cues

59
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,360
where to go the driver just slows down

60
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,360
when he gets to a set of points gets out

61
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,960
and pulls a lever that looks a bit like

62
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,560
this

63
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,479
and then gets back in the cab and

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,239
carries on his journey

65
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,160
but when we started having intercity

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
railways that started carrying more

67
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,920
people at faster speeds we really

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,239
started to need signaling and the first

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,080
of these railways in the world was the

70
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,760
liverpool manchester railway which

71
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,599
opened in 1830

72
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
and in those days they had people who

73
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,959
took dual roles of doing security on the

74
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,040
railway and doing signaling and they

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,239
were policemen basically and they were

76
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,480
known as bobby's and you'll still he'll

77
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,160
hear signalman on the railways today

78
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000
referred to as bobby's

79
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,440
and they were spaced every mile along

80
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,000
the track and they gave simple signals

81
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,239
to the trains with their arms or later

82
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,319
on with red and green flags and they had

83
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:49,760
simple levers by the track they could

84
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,599
pull for the points just to stop the

85
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,120
driver having to get out and do it

86
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,400
themselves

87
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,160
um these were some of the early sort of

88
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,920
signals that were then used when they

89
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
moved from um flags and arm signals to

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
actually fix signals these are early

91
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,440
forms of semaphore signals which look

92
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,680
just like a flag stuck out or an arm

93
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,040
stuck out

94
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,400
and you can see here on the left we've

95
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,200
got

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
the danger position is it sticking out

97
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,800
horizontally

98
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,959
caution so warning you you might need to

99
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:18,400
stop soon

100
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,920
is diagonally down and all clear is uh

101
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,239
where it's hidden inside the

102
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:26,159
post of the signal and this is kind of

103
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,519
what these things look like you'd have a

104
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,200
signal box with the signals mounted

105
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
directly above the signal box and a

106
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,080
little man in the uh signal box pulling

107
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,319
levers to control those signals

108
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,760
now this takes us on to our first

109
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,519
accident now at this stage in railway

110
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,360
history i could have picked any number

111
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
of accidents because there were loads of

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,519
accidents in those days and loads and

113
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,280
loads of people got seriously injured or

114
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,920
died um but this one is one i picked uh

115
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,200
abbott's ripped and on the east coast

116
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,200
main line uh 1876 13 people died about

117
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,879
50 people were injured

118
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,879
and basically the problem was

119
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,360
that you were using the absence of

120
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,040
something to say that it was safe to

121
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,200
continue so you were saying here if you

122
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,959
can't see the signal because it's hidden

123
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,120
inside the post then that's great carry

124
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,319
on drive at full speed that's fine until

125
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:14,159
the signal fails in some way like in

126
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,639
this case it froze inside the post and

127
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,160
couldn't come out so the signal flows

128
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,560
that proceed and the uh and the drivers

129
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,720
carried on and there was a crash

130
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,880
um so after this they moved into

131
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,800
different types of semaphore signaling

132
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,040
um keeping the signals at danger all the

133
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
time and only clearing them when they

134
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,960
needed to for a train

135
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,479
and also various other things like like

136
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,080
better brakes

137
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,600
but i mentioned about how they use these

138
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,680
signals but how did they know how did

139
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,040
the signalman know whether to set the

140
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,800
signal to stop or go

141
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,639
well in these days they use time

142
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,400
interval work which is exactly what it

143
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,400
sounds like count how long it was since

144
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,479
the last train and if it's been less

145
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
than 10 minutes stop the next train if

146
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,560
it's been kind of less than 20 minutes

147
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,000
proceed at caution if it's been more

148
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,720
than 20 minutes off you go full speed

149
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,039
that's fine until a train breaks down

150
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,880
somewhere and the train behind is at

151
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,560
least 20 minutes behind it but catches

152
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,919
it up and goes straight into the back of

153
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,800
it

154
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,160
and there were lots and lots of

155
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,160
accidents with this it was not fail-safe

156
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,240
in the slightest

157
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
and the thing that really moved this on

158
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,000
to the next stage of railway signaling

159
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,560
was better communication the electric

160
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,320
telegraph was developed in the early

161
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,240
1800s

162
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,160
it sent pulses down a wire of

163
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,600
electricity which is used to move a

164
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,440
needle uh this could be done in various

165
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,840
ways it could make a little bell go ding

166
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
or it could point to different

167
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,160
letters on a display you could send

168
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,360
messages that way um famously in 1845 it

169
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,680
was used to catch a murderer by sending

170
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
a message from london paddington station

171
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:42,720
saying

172
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,000
the murderers just got onto this

173
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,680
carriage of this train

174
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,360
down to the next station and then the

175
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,039
police got on at the next station and

176
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,320
arrested them

177
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,520
and this could also be used for

178
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,479
signaling

179
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
so here you've got a um

180
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,759
set of railway tracks on the bottom

181
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
there uh with four different signal

182
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,680
boxes one two three and four

183
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,080
um when the train the orange train comes

184
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,639
up to the second signal box it's going

185
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,600
to be given a red signal because the

186
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,880
blue train is still in between signal

187
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,280
box 2 and signal box 3.

188
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,080
but as soon as it goes past signal box 3

189
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,160
signal box 3 can send a message back to

190
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,680
signal box 2 saying the train's gone

191
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,319
past me now the section between you and

192
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,720
me is now empty of trains you can let

193
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,479
your train go

194
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,759
and that's what these areas were known

195
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,759
as the sections between signal boxes are

196
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:33,520
called block sections

197
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,039
and they developed a method called

198
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,720
absolute block where the rule was there

199
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,280
was absolutely only one train in each

200
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,759
block section at a time and they did

201
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
this by signal boxes sending messages to

202
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,240
each other on the telegraph system

203
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,240
saying hello i want a train to come into

204
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,400
this section is it clear oh yes it is

205
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,720
clear i'll accept it and then when the

206
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,000
train actually went into the section

207
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,280
there'll be a message saying the train

208
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:57,360
has entered the section and then one

209
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
later on saying the train has now left

210
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,639
the section

211
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
and along with this they had a set of of

212
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,680
new style semaphore signals and distance

213
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,479
signals and home signals or stop signals

214
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,080
stop signals are what they sound like it

215
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,080
tells you whether you can stop or go

216
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,479
distance signals give you a caution they

217
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
warn you that the next signal is going

218
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,840
to be a stop signal and that's because

219
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,560
trains can take a long time to slow down

220
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,639
they go very fast and their steel way

221
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,880
wheels on a steel track their stopping

222
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:28,479
distance is quite significant so they

223
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:31,039
have to slow down in advance to be able

224
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,800
to stop at a stop signal

225
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
a minor issue uh which has still not

226
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,440
fully been resolved with these semaphore

227
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,280
signals was that everyone agreed that

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,960
the signal sticking straight out meant

229
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,840
stop

230
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,199
but no one could agree on whether

231
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,160
sticking it down or up meant go

232
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,919
and so you have lower quadrant and upper

233
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,759
quadrant semaphore signals and you still

234
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,240
have those in the uk sometimes even in

235
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,160
the same area

236
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:56,720
different ways of saying go

237
00:07:56,720 --> 00:07:58,639
and so around this time you developed a

238
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:00,560
better signal box these are just a few

239
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,919
examples of different sorts of signal

240
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
boxes from different eras but you'll all

241
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,440
have seen these at sort of heritage

242
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,199
railways and on the mainline railway as

243
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,240
well

244
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,240
inside the signal box you'd have a big

245
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,160
lever frame we controlled all the

246
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,240
signals and here you can see the levers

247
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:15,520
are all painted in different colors and

248
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,680
there's a standard set of colors so the

249
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
red signals are these stop signals

250
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,039
you'll almost certainly find those are

251
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,280
most of the levers in the frame

252
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,879
the yellow signals are these distant

253
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,639
levers that give you a warning that the

254
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
next signal is going to be red

255
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,560
black is for points

256
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,039
blue is for point locks you really don't

257
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,039
want your points to move when a train's

258
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,479
going over them because that will derail

259
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,559
the train so you have an extra little

260
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,240
lever that puts a special locking bar

261
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,958
into the points and then any white ones

262
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,080
are spare

263
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,320
and you can also see this shelf above

264
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,120
the

265
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,000
levers with various indicators on it and

266
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,360
various other instruments on which i'll

267
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
come back to in a moment

268
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
but if we just first of all look at a

269
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,839
signaling diagram um for one of these

270
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,760
mechanical signal boxes this is yarmouth

271
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,279
south town

272
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,560
you can see there's lots of different

273
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,880
tracks at this station you can see just

274
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,800
about so we can zoom in a bit more you

275
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,560
can see the individual signals and the

276
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,040
individual points and every signal and

277
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,519
every point on this diagram has a number

278
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,000
like there's a signal 60 and a shunting

279
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,720
disk 17 and a 0.34

280
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,399
that's the number of the lever that you

281
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
pull to operate that particular bit of

282
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
equipment

283
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,360
well how did they operate them well it

284
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,760
was entirely mechanical they used rods

285
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,920
and wires so for signals there was a

286
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,519
wire that went around lots of pulleys

287
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,760
and eventually pulled down on the arm on

288
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
the signal and moved it to a different

289
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,560
location

290
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
and for points because they needed to

291
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,560
move uh in both directions in a slightly

292
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,720
different way they had rods but again

293
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,399
they had lots of couplings on the rods

294
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
to make this work

295
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,000
um that meant that you couldn't operate

296
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,480
things very far away so the rule was

297
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,640
that a mile away you could operate for

298
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,399
signals but only 350 yards away for

299
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:57,600
points

300
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,680
um so that meant you had to have loads

301
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,440
and loads of signal boxes because every

302
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,120
time you had a set of points if it was

303
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,800
more than 350 yards from another set of

304
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:06,800
points you needed another signal box to

305
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,000
control it

306
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,120
so this is a map of digcot um near

307
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,360
oxford near oxford just south of oxford

308
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,959
uh if any of you came to the tray came

309
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:17,440
by um trained to emf from london you'd

310
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,760
have gone past dig cot on the train

311
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,279
before you got up to worcester and then

312
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:22,800
led three to come here

313
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,920
and um this map shows about five miles

314
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,320
um across and you can see there are

315
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,240
seven signal boxes within those five

316
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,279
miles

317
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:32,560
there's a couple of ones at the end

318
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
milton and morton cutting and then

319
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,000
you've got about four signal boxes all

320
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
around the junctions and the stations uh

321
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,560
the station in the middle of dig cot

322
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,360
um this was very expensive because these

323
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
superboxes had to be manned by qualified

324
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,320
trained competent signalmen um and they

325
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,839
had to be monitored we manned some of

326
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:51,920
them 24 7 some of them slightly less

327
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,040
time

328
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,320
and we'll come to that in a moment as to

329
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,680
how the railway tried to get around that

330
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,440
later on

331
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,600
um there was also a lot of interlocking

332
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,920
of these levers so this means that you

333
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,440
can't set up

334
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,920
bad routes you can't set up a train to

335
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,279
come one direction and a train to come

336
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,360
the other direction straight into it or

337
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,800
you can't

338
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,440
put your stop signal to stop without

339
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,279
putting your distance signal to caution

340
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,040
to warn the driver that your stop signal

341
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,079
is going to be

342
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:20,399
stop and so on and this was all done

343
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:22,399
entirely mechanically again lots of

344
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,560
levers underneath the levers lots of

345
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,480
rods that interlocked with each other

346
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,040
had little notches cut out of them it's

347
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
basically a victorian style mechanical

348
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,959
computer

349
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
um for the communication they used block

350
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,120
bell so this was using the telegraph but

351
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,399
it just rang a little bell whenever

352
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,240
there was a pulse on the wire they'd

353
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,920
have different shaped bells for

354
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,279
different communications to different

355
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,880
signal boxes so you could tell

356
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,959
immediately from the bell uh which

357
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,720
signal box was calling you and they'd

358
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
have these bell codes so ding would be

359
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,720
call attention come on i'm trying to

360
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,600
talk to you listen up um ding ding ding

361
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,399
ding

362
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,880
three one would be is the line clear for

363
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,959
a train and lots of other things like

364
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
six bells in a row was obstruction

365
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,200
danger which you never wanted to hear

366
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,519
and also linked to the telegraph system

367
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
they would have um block instruments

368
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,079
which were you used to

369
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,560
set up a display on in both signal boxes

370
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,920
showing whether there was a train on the

371
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
line or not

372
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,880
and this combination of lock and block

373
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,200
the idea of absolute block signaling and

374
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,920
this interlocking was mandated by the

375
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,800
regulation of railways act in 1889

376
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,160
and i've got a very quick video that

377
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,760
hopefully you'll be able to hear

378
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,040
uh just to show you what this is like

379
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,639
this is from exeter west which is a

380
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,959
preserved signal box up there crew

381
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,200
um

382
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,639
so you can see here someone's pulling

383
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:43,040
the lever so you you unlock the lever at

384
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,959
the back by putting the little trigger

385
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,120
and then pull it

386
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,160
he's then

387
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
putting some of these back

388
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,839
that's call attention

389
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,600
so he responds with one bell

390
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,360
that's a particular code

391
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,760
he then sets his block instrument sends

392
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,120
a code back

393
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,480
and then goes back

394
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
and pulls more levers and this is what a

395
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,240
sigma would do all day

396
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,680
now the bit that some of you won't be

397
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,959
aware of and will probably be quite

398
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,120
surprised about is that this exact

399
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,839
system that was regulated in 1889 is

400
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,320
still in use today on mainline railways

401
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,399
in the uk not all of them but in some

402
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:24,880
places this is an example of semaphore

403
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,959
signals at worcester shrub hill station

404
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,800
again if you came through

405
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,120
um worcester came up from london through

406
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,959
worcester to lead three to get here by

407
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,880
train you would have gone past that

408
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
um this is the the local area of

409
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,800
railways in fact you can see where you

410
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,880
are near ledbury here going up to

411
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,519
worcester and and up towards droitwich

412
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,760
all of the signals in this whole local

413
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
area here are controlled by semaphore

414
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,839
signal walk signals from mechanical

415
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:52,000
signal boxes using absolute block

416
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,240
signaling all the same sort of things

417
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,959
that were done in the 1800s

418
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,480
just for a bit of local flavor if you

419
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,680
did come by train and get off at

420
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,279
leadprey you'll have seen the ledbury

421
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:02,720
signal box there at the end of the

422
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
platform uh this is what it looks like

423
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,120
inside um library used to have lots of

424
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,279
sidings and an extra junction so there's

425
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,519
lots of white levers that would have

426
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,440
been used for those but are now not in

427
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,440
use so they're painted white but you can

428
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,360
see the red levers black levers for some

429
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,279
points a yellow lever in the in the end

430
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,880
for a distance

431
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,399
um and one nice little thing about

432
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
library signal box one of the things you

433
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,320
have to do as a signal is check that

434
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,079
your signals are showing the right

435
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,199
display

436
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,959
um and at library they couldn't see the

437
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,560
signals because the footbridge got in

438
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,440
the way

439
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,360
um so they just cut a little hole in the

440
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,279
footbridge and so they've got a window

441
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,279
in the footbridge lined up perfectly so

442
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,639
the signalman standing in this signal

443
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,480
box can check the signal at the other

444
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,079
end of the platform to make sure it's

445
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:45,600
showing the right thing

446
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,279
and just for a slightly more impressive

447
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,120
view this is worcestershire uphill

448
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,199
station signal box again if you came

449
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,399
through worcester your train would have

450
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,040
been controlled by this signal box this

451
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
has 80 levers and very few of them are

452
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,560
marked despair now um there's a lot of a

453
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,079
lot of junctions and things in the shrub

454
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:05,279
hill area and these are all uh used very

455
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:07,600
very regularly

456
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,680
so we've got a way of controlling the

457
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,839
signals but we also need to know a bit

458
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,680
about where the train is because at the

459
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,279
moment we know it's somewhere in the

460
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:17,199
section between the last signal box and

461
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:19,360
our signal box but we don't know exactly

462
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,440
where and maybe we need to know maybe it

463
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:22,880
might be sitting at a signal waiting for

464
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,440
us to make it green or it's broken down

465
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:27,199
somewhere or it's sitting on some points

466
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,040
and we can't move those points because

467
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,199
if we derail the train so we want to

468
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,120
know where it is

469
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,040
well one way we can do that is just to

470
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,040
look out of the window and that's why

471
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,639
signal boxes are built up on the first

472
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,880
floor and they have big windows so you

473
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
can see the trains of course that gets a

474
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,759
bit difficult at night time in fog in

475
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:48,160
falling snow and and so on

476
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,600
um so there's another thing which is a

477
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,560
rule rule 55 of the original rule book

478
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,639
of the railways saying basically if your

479
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,160
train stopped

480
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,199
and you've been stopped for a few

481
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,000
minutes you have to send your firemen

482
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,680
out of your train

483
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
up to the signal box to say hello

484
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,440
signalman i am standing at such and such

485
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:08,720
a signal don't forget me um and they

486
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,079
would actually have to sign the train

487
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,079
register a book in the in the city box

488
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:13,600
to say they'd come

489
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,600
and the um sigma would have to put

490
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,720
something in place to make sure he

491
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,639
remembered that train was there

492
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:20,000
and that could be something like this a

493
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,079
lever collar you can see just circled in

494
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,320
blue on the left picture a bit of wood

495
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,160
on the back of one of the levers that

496
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,720
makes it impossible to pull the lever or

497
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,079
to pull the lever you just take the wood

498
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:32,399
off again but the logic there is that by

499
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:33,839
taking the wood off again you're

500
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,920
thinking huh why did i put this wood

501
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,279
here is this reminding me of something

502
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,360
important oh yeah i probably shouldn't

503
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,639
pull this lever because there's a train

504
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:43,440
in the way or whatever

505
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,600
unfortunately accidents can still happen

506
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,920
and the worst railway accident in the uk

507
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,920
was at quentin's hill uh near gretna

508
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,600
green in scotland this was during the

509
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,920
first world war um and one of the trains

510
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:55,600
involved contains a lot of troops going

511
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,079
down to liverpool uh to ship out for the

512
00:16:58,079 --> 00:16:59,440
for the first world war and it killed

513
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,120
over 200 people

514
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,560
and this was what the railway looked

515
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,160
like at quinton still the little pink

516
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,240
box at the top is the signal box and

517
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:08,319
they had a double track railway going to

518
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
glasgow and carlisle

519
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,559
and they had loops on either side sort

520
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,039
of sidings to put slower trains in

521
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,119
so first of all you've got the local

522
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,520
train comes up on the main line

523
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,039
now what's he going to do with it at

524
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,880
this point the train the local train

525
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,640
needs to stop somewhere for a while but

526
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,079
there's no space in the loop on that

527
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,439
side because another train is already

528
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:29,120
there because there were loads of extra

529
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,880
trains because of the war

530
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,840
so he reverses it on to the other line

531
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,840
now that's you know not maybe what you

532
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,280
would do every day but it's perfectly

533
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,480
safe

534
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,400
um he then has another train come down

535
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,240
and puts that in the loop that's that

536
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,840
black train at the top that's coal and

537
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,840
empty coal

538
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,760
wagons but then unfortunately he then

539
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,559
clears the signals for a troop train to

540
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,960
come down the main line

541
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,720
straight into that

542
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:57,120
and then unfortunately what then happens

543
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,640
is what happens in lots of railway

544
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,720
accidents which is that the accident on

545
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,039
one line causes debris to spread across

546
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,559
the other line

547
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,320
and a train comes down the other line

548
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,640
and crashes into the debris

549
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,880
um now why did this happen well

550
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,799
basically the signalman forgot about

551
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
that orange train

552
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,160
now just to make this even more ironic

553
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:19,039
that orange train was the train that he

554
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,679
had traveled to the signal box on that

555
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:22,880
morning

556
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,720
and it got out when it was stopped

557
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,799
outside the signal box but he still

558
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,120
forgot about it um

559
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,600
the driver did do rule 55 but the

560
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,760
signalman hadn't used the lever collar

561
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,919
and the driver didn't check that um

562
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,360
there were a lot of other things going

563
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
on there was shift change irregularities

564
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,799
someone was covering for someone when

565
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,720
they shouldn't have been someone didn't

566
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,360
sign the register properly other people

567
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,559
were in the box who shouldn't have

568
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:47,440
beaten

569
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,360
but in the end there was no way for the

570
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,880
signalman to know that the train was

571
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,760
there and he forgot it was

572
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:55,840
so after quinton's hill a bit before but

573
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,520
also particularly afterwards there was a

574
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,280
development in train detection

575
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,840
technologies principally track circuits

576
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,440
so the way this works is you take some

577
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,120
kind of power source a battery or some

578
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,760
other power source and you um feed

579
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,360
electricity into the two rails of the

580
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:12,320
track

581
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,080
and then at the other end you get the

582
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:16,000
electricity coming out of the track and

583
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,760
you put it into a relay a signaling

584
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,720
relay

585
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,480
and so when there's no train on the

586
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,679
track the electricity goes all the way

587
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:23,120
through the track out the other end to

588
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,280
the relay and you mark the signal screen

589
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,760
or you say there's no train there

590
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:30,240
however if you put a

591
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,240
set of wheels on the train these wheels

592
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
are metal they've got a metal axle on

593
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,559
them connecting them so they short

594
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:38,320
circuit the electricity going through

595
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,919
the track and rather than going right to

596
00:19:39,919 --> 00:19:41,360
the other end of the track it gets

597
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,559
short-circuited and goes back to the

598
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,120
battery so in that case the relay

599
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,840
doesn't get any power and that means

600
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,679
that a train must be on that section of

601
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:50,559
track

602
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:51,919
now the brilliant thing about this is

603
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:55,039
it's fail safe it's if the track if the

604
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:57,520
signal if the relay doesn't get any

605
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,600
power then there's a train there so if

606
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,039
the battery fails

607
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:02,159
you just think there's a train there

608
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,520
when there isn't which is far better

609
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:04,880
than thinking there isn't a train there

610
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,880
when there actually is

611
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,880
so um this was used in various ways it

612
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
could be interlocked with the points and

613
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,000
signals by doing some very basic

614
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,919
electromagnet work with the with the

615
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,640
levers um and do things like stop a set

616
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,720
of points being moved while the train is

617
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,200
is going over them um and other things

618
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,039
like you can't clear a set of signals if

619
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,400
there's a train in the way that all that

620
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,760
kind of stuff that would have solved

621
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,679
quentin's hill and you can see here what

622
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,360
the diagram would look like above a

623
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:31,440
signal box these little black lozenges

624
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,320
there

625
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
are little lights that light up uh red

626
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,120
when the track circuit is occupied

627
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,720
and this was installed

628
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,039
mostly in the 1900s really

629
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
and this also as a slight diversion is

630
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,280
why leaves on the line are a great

631
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,360
problem for railways

632
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,520
um because leaves on the line insulate

633
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,640
um the wheels from the track

634
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,640
so if your wheels are insulated from the

635
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,600
track they won't short-circuit the track

636
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,960
and it will look like there isn't a

637
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
train there when there actually is

638
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,120
and they also reduce the grip and make

639
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,720
it harder to stop so you've got two

640
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,799
problems with that which is why network

641
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,240
rail spend a lot of money on things like

642
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,320
rail head treatment trains which go

643
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,400
around blasting sand and water at the

644
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
track to get this leaf residue off

645
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
because it can cause major problems for

646
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,320
the signaling system

647
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,640
um just as also a quick aside one other

648
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,280
way of dealing with this is using axle

649
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,799
counters instead so these are little

650
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:28,640
things that are mounted to the track and

651
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,960
they count the number of axles that go

652
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,000
past

653
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,799
their sensor and they count it in at the

654
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,400
beginning of a section and out at the

655
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,880
end of a section and if once you've

656
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,280
counted it out you count up for in you

657
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,120
count down again for out and if the

658
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:44,880
answer is zero then there's no axles

659
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,960
left in the section and that section is

660
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,000
clear

661
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,000
um if you want to talk to me later you

662
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,880
can think about why um the swiss railway

663
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
system has a regulation that no trade

664
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:59,840
may run with exactly 256 axles

665
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:01,760
i am not joking you can run a train with

666
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,960
257 but not 256.

667
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,919
um so anyway i'm moving on them

668
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,679
and the railways as we got into the

669
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:11,440
1900s started to introduce color light

670
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,360
signals and there were two reasons for

671
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,520
that one was that you can show more than

672
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,400
just stop and go on a color light signal

673
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,360
and the other thing is that you can

674
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
control them from a long way away

675
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:22,559
because it's just electricity you're not

676
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:24,720
having to physically pull the levers for

677
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,159
the mechanical lever thing sometimes you

678
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:27,440
really have to put your back into

679
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,720
pulling it if it's a signal that's a

680
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,559
mile away whereas a signal that's 20

681
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,640
miles away can be controlled easily as a

682
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,000
color light

683
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,600
um and they introduce something called

684
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,679
multi-aspect signaling where a signal

685
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,080
could show one of maybe four different

686
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,200
aspects four different different views

687
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,760
one would be stop which is a red light

688
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
another would be preliminary caution so

689
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,679
this is warning you

690
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,400
that the next signal is going to be

691
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,600
caution

692
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,200
and caution is warning you that the next

693
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,799
signal is going to be red so you get

694
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,559
double the amount of warning so as

695
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,400
trains got faster they took even longer

696
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,480
to stop and you needed more warning and

697
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,799
you've also got of course clear

698
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:05,919
so what would happen here is you've got

699
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:08,000
a train in the distance there just

700
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,600
behind the train would be a red signal

701
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,640
so you don't go into the back of the

702
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,799
train before that would be a single

703
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,640
yellow before that would be a double

704
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,360
yellow and before that would be a green

705
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,880
and because they were using electricity

706
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,240
now to control the signals they didn't

707
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:22,400
need these big levers to actually get

708
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,480
mechanical effort

709
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,880
they could use tiny little levers so um

710
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,240
these were used in the in the early

711
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,720
1900s um liverpool limestone actually

712
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,640
had them until a few years ago and they

713
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,000
were used on the london underground a

714
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
lot until a few years ago but more

715
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,000
widespread than this was something

716
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:41,120
called nx panels which stands for

717
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:44,879
entrance exit panels

718
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:45,840
and

719
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:48,159
these are designed in such a way

720
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:51,200
that you don't have to press a lever or

721
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
button for every individual signal or

722
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,080
every individual point you have a long

723
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,000
panel like this that shows a diagram of

724
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,559
the railways on it so all these black

725
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:02,480
lines are tracks and you've got these

726
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,000
little buttons uh and buttons and twisty

727
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,760
knobs here and what you'll do is you'll

728
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:10,000
say you want a train to go from here to

729
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,279
here so you press the button at the

730
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,960
beginning at the entrance the button at

731
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,159
the exit at the exit and it sets up all

732
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,679
of the points and all of the signals

733
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,600
along the route for you so sometimes

734
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,200
before you might have had to pull 20

735
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,360
levers for a single train to do a single

736
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,919
movement now you just press start stop

737
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,080
and it does everything for you

738
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,240
the way it does this is with a load of

739
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,320
relays it's got entirely

740
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,840
electromechanical

741
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,480
interlocking so the relays set what you

742
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,400
can and can't do so again it won't let

743
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,080
you do something stupid like set

744
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,640
conflicting routes or set routes into a

745
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:44,000
section that's occupied with a track

746
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,600
circuit

747
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
and they also use the intel the relays

748
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,159
to do this entrance exit route setting

749
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,600
part of it

750
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
and you have a massive relay room

751
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,799
underneath the uh signaling panel

752
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:59,039
um with maybe tens of thousands of

753
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,120
relays in it and when you're in there

754
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,120
when it's operating as i have been uh

755
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,640
you hear all the relays clicking all the

756
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,760
time so when the signal and sets the

757
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,120
route it will go click click click click

758
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,159
click click click click click click

759
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:08,960
click

760
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,480
and when a trainer enters the security

761
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,080
go click the click as they change the

762
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,799
track circuits and and so on

763
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:17,039
um some of you may remember this next

764
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,720
accident particularly if you lived in in

765
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,480
the south of england at the time this

766
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,279
was 1988 at clapham junction station

767
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,200
which killed 35 people but injured

768
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,120
almost 500.

769
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
and this was an interesting one because

770
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,799
you had the line going from southampton

771
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:32,080
to london

772
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,159
and a train came along from southampton

773
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,080
towards london

774
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:37,440
and did you see what happened there the

775
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,880
signal was green

776
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
and as the train came along it suddenly

777
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:42,880
went red directly in front of it now

778
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,240
that shouldn't happen you should get a

779
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:48,159
warning of of yellow first so the train

780
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,760
driver stopped at the next signal even

781
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:50,880
though it was green and phone the

782
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,640
signalman to go you know what's going on

783
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,000
this signal just went back to red in

784
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,279
front of me

785
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:57,440
unfortunately while he was doing that

786
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,360
the signal behind him

787
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,799
went from red

788
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:02,480
to yellow

789
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,559
and another train came along from behind

790
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,080
and crashed into it

791
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,520
and then of course as i said before what

792
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:08,799
happens next

793
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,159
a train comes on the other track and

794
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:12,400
crashes into the wreckage

795
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,520
now this was

796
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,240
all stuff that should not happen

797
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,240
but signaling upgrades were taking place

798
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,600
in the area

799
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,760
and there was what's called a false feed

800
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,240
in the relay room um basically one of

801
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,640
the relays was powered by a stray wire

802
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,640
which touched the terminal

803
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,279
now all the wires should have been um

804
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,200
tied up out of the way when they weren't

805
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:34,640
being used they should have been had had

806
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,320
the insulation tape put on the ends of

807
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,400
the bare ends of the wires but they

808
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,760
weren't the signaling technician had

809
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:41,360
been massively overworked with this

810
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,440
re-signaling project and there hadn't

811
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,960
been good enough checking or wire

812
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:47,360
counting and that meant that this

813
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,240
um

814
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,760
this wire could be connected to the

815
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:52,080
relay giving it power all the time and

816
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,679
giving this what's called wrong side

817
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:55,440
failure

818
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,960
after that there was a lot of things

819
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,200
changed to do with working hour limits

820
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,960
mandatory testing

821
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,120
different interlocking methods and so on

822
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,360
also radio communications with trains

823
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,799
was a big thing so you can send an

824
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,279
emergency stop message to a train

825
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:10,799
but actually there was a similar

826
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,000
accident at waterloo in 2017 very

827
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
similar causes i mean but very

828
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:18,399
dissimilar outcomes this didn't injure

829
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:20,240
anybody or kill anybody the train was

830
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,399
going very slowly and it went into the

831
00:27:22,399 --> 00:27:25,120
side of an engineering train

832
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,520
but it was caused by unauthorized wiring

833
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,360
modifications in the relay room and

834
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,799
there hadn't been proper checking and

835
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:34,399
wire counting again

836
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:36,000
so maybe we haven't learned the lessons

837
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,760
from that

838
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,600
so just moving on to a few other things

839
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,200
um one other problem you can have is

840
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
driver error a driver can see a red

841
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:45,440
signal but not notice it or forget it or

842
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,679
not be paying attention or whatever and

843
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,679
pass the signal at danger and we call

844
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:52,399
that a spat a signal past a danger

845
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:53,919
and one of the worst paths was the

846
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,120
halloween wheelstone crash in 1952 which

847
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
was the second worst accident uh in in

848
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,799
the uk

849
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,120
and here you had a train sitting in

850
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,960
howard wheelstone station in in north

851
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,000
london

852
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,960
and you had a yellow distance signal and

853
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,840
two semaphore signals both at stop

854
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,320
and a train came sailing right past all

855
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,880
three of those and crashed into it and

856
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,720
yes yet again a train came on the other

857
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:21,279
direction and crashed into it as well

858
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:22,159
um

859
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,760
no one knows why this happened because

860
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,440
the driver and fireman were both killed

861
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,640
in the collision

862
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,200
um it was a bit foggy but not massively

863
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:30,640
foggy and all the other drivers have

864
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,799
seen those signals so whether the driver

865
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,720
got confused or not seen them or

866
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,520
forgotten about them who knows but he

867
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,799
passed the signals at danger and went

868
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:41,120
straight back into the other train

869
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,880
so to deal with this they introduced

870
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,480
something called automatic warning

871
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,720
system now this is a set of uh permanent

872
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,240
magnets and electromagnets that are

873
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,240
located between the track and the

874
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,640
electromagnetic is is um energized or

875
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,559
not depending on the state of the signal

876
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,880
and this is picked up by a magnetic

877
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,640
receiver on the train

878
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,520
which means that if you go past a signal

879
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,840
at anything other than green so if it's

880
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,880
at any of the cautions or danger aspects

881
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
then you'll get a little buzzer in your

882
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,440
cab

883
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,520
the little display will turn out to look

884
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:12,960
like that it's called the sunflower

885
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,360
display that sort of sort of black and

886
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,240
yellow

887
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,679
pattern

888
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,600
and if you don't press a button in the

889
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,600
cab to acknowledge that within about two

890
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,600
seconds of the belt going off then the

891
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:26,320
brakes will automatically be applied

892
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,240
um unfortunately this doesn't still

893
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,080
didn't work all the time

894
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,840
um there was an accident at labret grove

895
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,039
which number of you probably will

896
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,720
remember it was one of the spate of

897
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:35,840
three or four big accidents that

898
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,559
happened in the late 90s early 2000s

899
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,080
near paddington and here you had a train

900
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,640
um that was coming out of london and a

901
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,240
train going into london

902
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,799
and uh there was a red signal to wait

903
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,720
while train two got out of the way

904
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,240
before train one went across that

905
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,799
crossover to where train 2 is but train

906
00:29:54,799 --> 00:29:57,360
1 went straight past the signal

907
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,919
and crashed into it at quite high speed

908
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,840
now aws

909
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,559
was in operation here but because aws

910
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,399
comes up every time you go past anything

911
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:09,200
other than green it comes up for like 50

912
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,440
60 70 of the signals you go past because

913
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:13,039
if you're running on a congested railway

914
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,559
near london you're never gonna have

915
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,000
green signals because this train's too

916
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,039
close to you you're just gonna have

917
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,200
yellow ones so the drivers get used to

918
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:20,559
just cancelling it

919
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,240
and it was a signal that was frequently

920
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,960
spatted it couldn't be seen very well

921
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,880
the driver had poor training there was

922
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,919
something there was nothing called

923
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:29,279
something called flank protection they

924
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,640
didn't have which would have meant that

925
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,880
the that the points were changed to stop

926
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,559
any kind of accidents like that even if

927
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,120
the driver had gone past the signal

928
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
and so um since then we they've

929
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,279
introduced train protection and warning

930
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
system tpws

931
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
uh which does the same kind of thing as

932
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:46,880
aws but a bit more cleverly it has

933
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,600
little transmitter grids uh on between

934
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,799
the tracks

935
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,240
and it deals with over speed as well so

936
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,279
if a train is coming up to a signal too

937
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:59,919
fast to stop at the signal

938
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:02,240
then the idea is this will notice in

939
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,159
advance of the signal apply the

940
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:06,480
emergency brake and the train will still

941
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,640
stop at the signal whereas of course if

942
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,440
you if your aws goes off at the signal

943
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,320
and you then start slowing down because

944
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,919
the emergency brake comes on you'll

945
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,600
still be way past the signal by the time

946
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:18,799
you stop

947
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:20,480
and this was introduced it was installed

948
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,279
in all high-risk locations by 2004 it's

949
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,039
still only at some signals it's not

950
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:27,200
every single signal but it does the

951
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,480
right kind of thing

952
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,840
and it definitely has helped reduce

953
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,399
spats

954
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:34,720
so just to finish off really in talking

955
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,240
about what the most modern form of

956
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,480
signaling is uh the most modern is what

957
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,919
are known as integrated electronic

958
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:41,600
control centers and the more modern

959
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,159
version of rail operating centers which

960
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,120
are basically the same as the big panels

961
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:49,039
but they're all on computer screens and

962
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:51,279
the uh signaler uses a mouse or in fact

963
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:53,200
a trackball to

964
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,120
click signals

965
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,039
or on the screen and again set roots in

966
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,039
this entrance exit way so clicking a

967
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,559
signal here clicking a signal there and

968
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:02,399
it sets the route between them

969
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:04,080
um they

970
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:06,799
um also some of these systems have what

971
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:08,399
i call what's called automatic route

972
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,559
setting so in that case he doesn't have

973
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,159
to set the route for each individual

974
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,120
train

975
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,200
but the um

976
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,120
computer system does that for him

977
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:18,559
assuming things are running to the

978
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,559
timetable of course when things aren't

979
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:21,840
running to the timetable which is quite

980
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,840
often uh the signal has to do a lot more

981
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,919
manual intervention

982
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,519
but the final example of where we can

983
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:30,159
move to with this is in-cab signaling so

984
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,559
this is moving from signals out part of

985
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:35,600
me outside on the track to um signals

986
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,120
that are actually displayed inside the

987
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:40,000
cap and this is the uh cab of a train

988
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,760
here you can see that little display in

989
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,360
the middle it's got a fairly prominent

990
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:45,279
speedometer on the screen

991
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,600
that shows you exactly what speed you

992
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,960
should be doing

993
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,640
to then be able to stop at the next

994
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,480
signal it shows you where you have

995
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,720
movement authorities as they're called

996
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:56,480
and how far you can go all

997
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:58,480
electronically on that and those are all

998
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:01,679
done by these blazes which are between

999
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,360
the track which are sort of passive

1000
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,360
radio transmitters that communicate

1001
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,120
where the train is

1002
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
combined with mobile phone based data

1003
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,960
something called gsm-r which is

1004
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,399
basically the same as ksm that you use

1005
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:13,679
for your mobile phone but a railway

1006
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,760
version that's got good coverage over

1007
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,000
nearly all the uk railway network now um

1008
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,640
to send information to the train

1009
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,799
and the benefit of this is you can move

1010
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:25,120
from fixed block signaling

1011
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,760
to moving block signaling

1012
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,679
so earlier you'd have these block

1013
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,919
sections that were between different

1014
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,440
signals or between different signal

1015
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,519
boxes and they were static in size you

1016
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,360
couldn't change them at all

1017
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,000
whereas moving block you can adjust the

1018
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
distance between trains based on how

1019
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,919
fast they're going if your train's going

1020
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,640
at 120 miles an hour it needs a longer

1021
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:48,080
stopping distance so it needs to be

1022
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:50,320
further back from the previous train if

1023
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:51,840
it's crawling along at 10 miles an hour

1024
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,200
to get into your terminal station in

1025
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,240
london

1026
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,679
then it can be far closer to the

1027
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:58,080
previous train because it can stop um so

1028
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,840
you can move from the sort of high speed

1029
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,080
indication at the bottom there to a

1030
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,960
lower speed moving block

1031
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,120
and then the final frontier really is

1032
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,440
automatic train operation um this has

1033
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,639
actually been running in the uk for

1034
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,480
quite a long time the victoria line when

1035
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,040
it was first introduced in 1968 in in

1036
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:17,440
london uh was automatic train operation

1037
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,440
there's a button on um the trains uh the

1038
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:25,359
cab display which says ato start and um

1039
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:26,879
the driver presses that and it drives

1040
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,879
itself automatically to the next station

1041
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:30,480
the driver is still there to open and

1042
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,560
close the doors monitor the systems and

1043
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:34,560
so on but he doesn't actually do any

1044
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:37,359
driving in normal situation

1045
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:38,960
uh the docklands lights railway you may

1046
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,839
also know uh is driverless uh you can

1047
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:44,480
sit at the front and enjoy um playing

1048
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,239
with the um you're pretending to be a

1049
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,520
driver as i used to do when i was a

1050
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:48,480
child

1051
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,960
and still an adult i think um

1052
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,040
and um and this had moving block and

1053
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,719
this was since the early 90s this had a

1054
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:56,639
moving block system to get better

1055
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,000
throughput on this kind of metro railway

1056
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,839
um

1057
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:03,839
so modern signaling in the uk is a real

1058
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,520
mixture on one journey you can come say

1059
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,400
from london to here as a number of you

1060
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,000
may have done you may have traveled on

1061
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,599
the victoria line or even nowadays

1062
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,359
crossrail in london which has automatic

1063
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,440
train train operation

1064
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,280
uh you then come up

1065
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,280
through some modern rail operation

1066
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,119
centers that cover um there's one called

1067
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:24,480
thames valley signaling center which

1068
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,720
covers london paddington up to dig court

1069
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,960
and oxford on computer-based signaling

1070
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,040
you'll then come up through some panel

1071
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,520
signal boxes around oxford you'll then

1072
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,680
come into a mechanically signaled area

1073
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,440
at worcester and move in and lead three

1074
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,920
so you've had all of this on one modern

1075
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,160
train doing a modern training journey in

1076
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:44,320
the uk which i think is quite amazing

1077
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,400
really just the breadth of signaling

1078
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,200
practice that is around in the uk

1079
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,720
so that's really all i've got to say

1080
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,200
here so thank you very much and feel

1081
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:57,000
free to come and talk to me afterwards

1082
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,880
you
