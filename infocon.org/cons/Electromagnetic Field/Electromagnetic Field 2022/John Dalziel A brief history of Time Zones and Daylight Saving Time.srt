1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:04,720
good morning ebf nice to be back back in

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,000
the field again

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,040
um

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,960
so the title of talk pretty much says it

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,559
all we're going to cover time zones in

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,840
daylight saving time we cover a couple

7
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,519
of other things first

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:15,440
railway time which is basically leads up

9
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,119
to time zones

10
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,560
and we're going to solve the problem at

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,880
the end of why your phone knows that

12
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,640
it's daylight saving time even if you

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,039
don't so

14
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,439
we'll kick off in britain

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:28,720
at the till end of the sort of

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,240
industrial revolution there's kind of

17
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,880
two important networks that come out um

18
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,960
that affect time keeping so the first is

19
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
the rail network in about the 1830s and

20
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,879
then the electric telegraph in the 1840s

21
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,800
okay

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,239
ah

23
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,000
everyone

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,399
the usb is the hdmi is here

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,840
okay i'll rewind so

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,280
right you can now see what it talks

27
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
about yeah time zones they're like

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,600
saving time um

29
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:07,520
so yeah like i said at the beginning

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,880
there's we're going to cover railway

31
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,720
time because it kind of leads up into

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,000
the time zone system so it's probably

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,600
worth covering that first and then in

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,040
the end we'll um we'll answer the

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,479
question of the phone and how your phone

36
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,960
knows when it's dst or not so

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,320
railway time

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,159
um two important networks coming out of

39
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,880
the late industrial revolution the

40
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,799
rail network and the telegraph and they

41
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,960
both have an impact on

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,640
the history of timekeeping

43
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,960
this is the first intercity railway this

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,720
is um the liverpool to manchester

45
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,320
railway in 1830 going an ungodly speed

46
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,520
of 30 miles an hour

47
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,079
within about 20 years

48
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,119
the network grows we get um top speeds

49
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,200
of 78 miles an hour

50
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,880
and quite you know broad network pretty

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,040
much everywhere is connected

52
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,200
and there's some standardization that

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,600
comes around around timekeeping so um to

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,600
kind of explain there's a lot of spiders

55
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,759
here

56
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,280
to kind of explain

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,840
why the timekeeping issue arises we're

58
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,840
going to take an imaginary journey so

59
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,800
let's say you get on um in london

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,640
london paddington you've got your stove

61
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,319
pipe hat on and your copy of the time's

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:18,160
under your arm and you're traveling to

63
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,440
bristol temple means you're going

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,040
westwards and it's going to be about a

65
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,040
four hour journey

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,319
um

67
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,680
you've got incredible sight lines you

68
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,879
can see ben

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,520
big ben somehow from paddington um and

70
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,959
you check it's one o'clock in london

71
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,879
it's one o'clock on your pocket watch

72
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
you travel for four hours

73
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,040
on your pocket watch it's five o'clock

74
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,959
but when you arrive in bristol

75
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,800
the clocks all say something different

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,120
they say 4 49 see somehow you've gained

77
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
11 minutes um

78
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,879
why why is that

79
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,920
um

80
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
so to answer that question you sort of

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,080
have to realize that at this point in

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,440
time there is no sort of time

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,599
standardization really so

84
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,280
in london it's like you're in greenwich

85
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,440
park in london and you you see the sun

86
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,959
in the sky and you track as it goes

87
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,640
overhead and at the highest point in the

88
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
sky that is noon in london

89
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,360
you do the same in bristol so when it

90
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
goes overhead that's noon in bristol

91
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,760
those are not simultaneous events

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,000
they happen about 11 minutes apart

93
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,640
because the earth is rotating so

94
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,959
local time in bristol is not the same as

95
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,720
local time in london they are off by a

96
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,159
little bit

97
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,920
so that's a problem if you're trying to

98
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:24,720
make

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,640
railroad scheduling or railroad

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,920
timetables

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,799
so

102
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
a bit of a trauma warning for this

103
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,680
next slide if you work in graphic design

104
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,280
or user experience you might want to

105
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,840
look away now

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,760
this is railway timetables in the 1840s

107
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,840
and obviously timetables are hard anyway

108
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,200
but when you get everything running on

109
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,879
local time it's just way more

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
complicated so what came about was a

111
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,440
sort of standardization or a move

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
towards a standard time um and gmt was

113
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,760
the obvious one i mean greenwich

114
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,120
observatory had been around a couple of

115
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,720
hundred years at this point and all of

116
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,480
the maps and

117
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,080
you know some c charts and whatever

118
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,840
we're all using gmt

119
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
um so it made sense to move on to gmt so

120
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,959
uh great western were the first to do it

121
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
and it sort of became standardized in

122
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,439
1847 then it took a while for it to sort

123
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,840
of roll out to the rest of the uk

124
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,798
um but yeah by 1855 pretty much

125
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:20,160
all the times the cities had moved

126
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,600
across um it wasn't universally nobody's

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,120
universally happy but obviously london

128
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,479
was because you know you have to change

129
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,400
your clocks or anything but bristol was

130
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,240
the one that was one of the ones that

131
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,919
wasn't entirely happy about it this is

132
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,000
the bristol exchange clock installed in

133
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,440
1822

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,759
the hands on the i'll see where this can

135
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,400
go on the left hand side there's two two

136
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,600
red hands

137
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,440
those show the hour in the minute in

138
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,360
bristol local time

139
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,040
but that extra hand on the other side

140
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,639
was added later

141
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,160
and that actually shows gmt so that's

142
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,360
not actually a second hand that's

143
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
another minute hand so you can imagine

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:54,720
sort of

145
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,560
bristol here then locked 11 minutes

146
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,000
apart as it kind of moved around like

147
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,759
that so that that clock's still there i

148
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,600
checked on um street view before i came

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,280
in so you can still go and see i i want

150
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:04,560
to go see it

151
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
um but yeah even bristol came on board

152
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,520
eventually in 1852 so

153
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,120
so imagine

154
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,479
the same problem

155
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,800
railroad scheduling timetables and so on

156
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,199
um in america much bigger area so you've

157
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,960
got um a much sort of larger

158
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,360
more developed railroad network as well

159
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
um in 1853 shortly after britain's

160
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,840
standardized on gmt there was a

161
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,919
particularly nasty railroad accident on

162
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
the providence of worcester line

163
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,080
railroad

164
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,919
many people died and it was basically

165
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,199
attributed to bad scheduling

166
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,039
so this is the railway network a little

167
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,800
bit further on the 1870s and you can see

168
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,400
it stretches all the way across the usa

169
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,240
so there's quite um

170
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,800
quite a lot of work to be done if you

171
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,280
want to take a journey from new york

172
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,160
across to san francisco looking at that

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:54,960
um

174
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,880
you're probably gonna have to jump a few

175
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
few lines and the way that the networks

176
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,360
were in america was

177
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,680
all of the trained

178
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,639
railroad timetables ran on whatever the

179
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,280
corporate headquarters was for the

180
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,600
railroad so new york central railroad

181
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,440
ran new york time so if you're trying to

182
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,720
make a connection you imagine you're

183
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,080
sitting in somewhere in the middle and

184
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,680
you've got to work at what local time is

185
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,280
in new york and then convert that in

186
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,319
your head and then you've got a

187
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,520
connection to make so you've got to

188
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,039
connect to something else and there's

189
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,560
all sorts of things done to try and make

190
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
this easy but it's it's not an easy

191
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,039
problem to solve so standardization was

192
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,600
one way to try and simplify this problem

193
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,960
um

194
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,000
america's bigger you know so a time zone

195
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,759
system was the sort of the way that they

196
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:39,280
approached they looked at the gmt and

197
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,080
then

198
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
essentially applied it into five zones

199
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,960
across um the us

200
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,720
notice they

201
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
sort

202
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,120
there's the circles at the top that's

203
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,440
degrees of longitude so

204
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,520
um i don't know if we've got anybody any

205
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,720
small children but i'm going to kind of

206
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
cover latitude and longitude very

207
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,520
quickly so everyone sort of knows what

208
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,759
it is it's a way of pinpointing a point

209
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:00,880
on the globe

210
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,759
um latitude lines go

211
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:05,759
around the globe um

212
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,360
big fat one around the middle much like

213
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,919
myself um is the equator and then you

214
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,560
rise of longitude around pulse pole

215
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,160
and we'd find one of those as being the

216
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,400
prime meridian so that becomes zero and

217
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,319
everything else gets a number every 15

218
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,960
degrees around the earth um

219
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:23,039
having a prime meridian gives you a

220
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:24,160
weird side effect called the

221
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,520
international date line which we'll look

222
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,360
at in a bit as well so

223
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,199
right so this is the time zone system

224
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,120
and get spiders out of the way

225
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,880
1883 we've got britain on gmt uh you've

226
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,800
got america with its sort of five zone

227
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,720
system also using

228
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,039
um greenwich as uh the prime meridian

229
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:43,360
because of the way that came about

230
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,479
um 1884 rolls around and the idea is to

231
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:47,919
take this system and roll it out to the

232
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:49,120
entire world

233
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,919
so there is a conference to do that um

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,440
the international meridian conference

235
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,800
meets in washington dc

236
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
yeah there's some fabulous mustaches and

237
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,160
beards going on in this workout here um

238
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,800
41 delegates from 26 countries including

239
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,520
such stars of the ottoman empire um

240
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,960
and hawaii which was actually an

241
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,520
independent nation at that point so

242
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
so here's what they debated

243
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,720
um there's lots of things on here but

244
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,560
resolution two was the principle one

245
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,840
that's the one that says we're going to

246
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,560
make greenwich or gmt the prime meridian

247
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,680
of the world

248
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,000
um here's what i've been down 22 nations

249
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,639
voted for it

250
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,240
the dominican public voted against it

251
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,599
i've actually got haven't got the bottom

252
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
of why that was i would like to know um

253
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,839
brazil and france abstained

254
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
so why gredish

255
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,000
these were all possible meridians in

256
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,159
1884

257
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,039
every

258
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,958
sort of major power in europe had an

259
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,360
observatory and every observatory

260
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,519
made observations and therefore they had

261
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,360
a meridian of their own you know france

262
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,600
would have had the paris observatory

263
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,920
uh you know copenhagen for denmark et

264
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,200
cetera et cetera so all of these were

265
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,519
possible so why particularly greenwich

266
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,480
um

267
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,560
well it ended up it's kind of boring as

268
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,200
really but it's pragmatism um the us and

269
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,120
british systems were already

270
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,040
using it um so no there's no need to

271
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,040
make any changes but the kind of killer

272
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,040
blow really was that britain was kind of

273
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
at the height of its

274
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,560
sea power at this point um and british

275
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,800
naval charts had greenwich on them so

276
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,920
you didn't have to print a whole bunch

277
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,080
of new charts you basically just kept

278
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,480
the old ones and greenwich was accepted

279
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,080
so

280
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,360
right a couple of things about the

281
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:27,839
primary ian if you get a chance

282
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,440
um i really do recommend going to the

283
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,959
royal branch observatory it's in

284
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,480
greenwich park it's beautiful it's got

285
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,080
lots of fun stuff going on inside it's

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,720
got harrison c clocks and h4 and things

287
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,760
like that so

288
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
um but if you

289
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,800
go there you will probably get your

290
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,720
photograph taken on this line because

291
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,920
it's one of the things that you can do

292
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,080
there that there is a group of people

293
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,040
hopefully you can see it in the

294
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,800
photograph so the group of people on

295
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,000
there and they're crowded on the line

296
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,360
and you get a photograph and that's you

297
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,600
on the on the prime meridian

298
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,279
um it's worth pointing out prime

299
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,839
meridian is a magical invisible line and

300
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,240
it goes through all sorts of places so

301
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,680
you could probably get your photograph

302
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,480
much quicker in a pizza in mali or

303
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,640
something you know there's and

304
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:08,160
there's plenty of places on that line

305
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,920
but the people everyone likes to go and

306
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,279
get it done out there so i've kind of

307
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:12,560
drawn the line on so it's a little bit

308
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,839
clearer

309
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:17,120
so the line in red is that's still in

310
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,880
as it sort of runs in and you'll see it

311
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,160
kind of goes in through a door and then

312
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,560
it's dotted it all the way through

313
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,519
um

314
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,360
this is what the back looks like my

315
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,040
beautiful assistant here is

316
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
demonstrating it goes into a door and

317
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,079
you can see there's lots of flaps and

318
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,399
stuff a bit further up and at the back

319
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,560
you've got the same sort of thing so the

320
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
reason for that

321
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,200
is that inside

322
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,800
it all opens up

323
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,560
and you have what's called the airy

324
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,640
transit instrument in there which is

325
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,560
essentially a telescope that's on a sort

326
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,399
of cog if you like so it's it only moves

327
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,959
in one direction but um what it does is

328
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,079
it tracks

329
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,720
a star in the sky and it as it transits

330
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,800
across um

331
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,120
the the sky so that's

332
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,519
that particular instrument was designed

333
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,440
by george biddlery who was the

334
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,680
astronomer royal at the time

335
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,560
um

336
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
and

337
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,320
because the prime meridian was defined

338
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,880
as being greenwich this was uh it was

339
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,480
essentially the airy meridian

340
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:15,200
specifically his meridian

341
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,959
that became the primary name

342
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,120
and fun fact it's not his only one

343
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,600
there's one on mars

344
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,360
it runs through the airy crater as you

345
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,800
can see it just there on the right hand

346
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,839
side

347
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,440
so yeah he has two prime meridians which

348
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,760
is like mad skills

349
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,959
yeah

350
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,560
okay if you walk around greenwich you'll

351
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,160
notice plaques on the wall so there are

352
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,680
other meridians this is the point of

353
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
making the area was the specifically the

354
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,160
prime meridian and john flamstead who

355
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:43,600
was the original first astronomer oil um

356
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,200
he gets one as well

357
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,959
when they built the royal greenwich

358
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,120
observatory it was um they spent a lot

359
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,560
of money on it but they didn't actually

360
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,079
spend any money on equipment he had to

361
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:54,560
buy his own so when he got his act

362
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,720
together and got some kit then he put it

363
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,639
in that point and that became his period

364
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,959
and the second one is the uh edmund

365
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:02,880
halley the second astronomer all so

366
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,240
you'll see these kind of dotted around

367
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,000
if you're up there

368
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,760
the other fun fact as well i mean as

369
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,360
probably this crowd might know this one

370
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,200
but the primarily in

371
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,920
is not the same as the gps sparing its

372
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,079
official name is the international earth

373
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,160
rotation and reference service meridian

374
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,839
reference meridian

375
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,360
but called let's go and call it gps for

376
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,120
now but there are they're quite

377
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,040
different quite far apart um there's a

378
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,880
bin that marks it so you can't actually

379
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,320
find it if you're if you're looking for

380
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,480
it but it's not really or you can take

381
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,240
your gps receiver and then you will find

382
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,279
it um the reason for this

383
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,760
is a little complicated essentially

384
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,600
models of the earth in 1800 models of

385
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,160
the earth in 1960s whenever gps was

386
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,279
being developed

387
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:46,000
are have improved so that's the short

388
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,680
answer there is a paper on it if you're

389
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,279
interested you go into the all the

390
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,839
details

391
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,200
um the royal grence observatory is not

392
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,279
the only royal observatory in london um

393
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,279
i only found this out a few years back

394
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,120
but there's a observatory in queue

395
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,800
called the king's observatory um built

396
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,720
for george iii it's beautiful building

397
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,480
looks really good it's in a golf course

398
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,160
apparently but um i would like to get it

399
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,920
at some point and of course it had its

400
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,839
own equipment so i get some meridians so

401
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:11,519
a few meridians in london right we're

402
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:13,519
going to cover time zones in theory i'll

403
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,959
do practice in a second but this is how

404
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:16,720
it's supposed to work

405
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,680
here's the earth we divide it

406
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,839
15 degrees of longitude and with a

407
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,639
primary in in greenwich

408
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:25,920
which gives you

409
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:27,279
an international date line in the

410
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,040
pacific

411
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,000
okay

412
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,560
how this works in practice is any

413
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,360
territory that is in one in in a zone

414
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,279
can be in the zone or it can decide to

415
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,519
be somewhere else and that happens a lot

416
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,320
so

417
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,600
actually no i'll give you the width of

418
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,360
the zone so the zones are 15 degrees

419
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,120
apart as well but the line down the

420
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,639
middle and it's

421
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:48,160
seven and a half degrees either side so

422
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,399
it's they span 15 degrees from the

423
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,680
center of that point so if i take the

424
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,800
lines away it's probably a little easier

425
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,639
to see

426
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:56,399
right in practice it gets a little

427
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,440
messier

428
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,120
because you know it's the real world and

429
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,040
there's country boundaries and all sorts

430
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,360
of stuff going on um

431
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,519
not everything runs on one or

432
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:07,360
time zones either there's quite a lot of

433
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:10,079
half our time zones um daughter about

434
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,680
and in fact there's a couple of what

435
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,680
three 45-minute ones

436
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
nepal being the most um

437
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,839
sort of well-known example

438
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,399
uh the time the thing to kind of know

439
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:21,440
about

440
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,360
this is such a messy thing the

441
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,680
international dateline

442
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
is a phenomenon caused by having the

443
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,959
prime meridian there is no standards for

444
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:33,279
this at all it's just a side effect of

445
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,199
having the prime meridian so there's a

446
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,680
lot of leeway in terms of if let's say

447
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,399
you're piling a ship across

448
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:42,160
the dateline it's entirely up to you

449
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,600
really when you set your clocks and how

450
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,000
you how you shift across and any lines

451
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,560
that you see are guidance really so this

452
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
way you get quite a lot of um difference

453
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,079
when you sort of

454
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,320
see how google have it and how you know

455
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,399
other maps and draw it because there

456
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:57,600
really is no

457
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,839
standard for it at all and of course

458
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,639
peop some uh islands have jumped across

459
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,560
the date line so you've got this

460
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,000
notion of the the line islands of

461
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,120
kirbati which are plus 14 hours which

462
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,480
means that any point in time you could

463
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,320
have three days on the go at once you

464
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,839
get a monday tuesday wednesday same

465
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,680
moment in time having three essential

466
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,959
local um values yeah super messy it's

467
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,040
probably like a whole talk on that

468
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:22,399
but um

469
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,240
other things too china really should be

470
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,240
three time zones um when you look at

471
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,079
where it's covering but it all runs on

472
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:30,240
beijing time

473
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,079
um and antarctica this is the one i kind

474
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,600
of wanted to get at the bottom of i was

475
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,199
when i pitched the talk i didn't know

476
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:36,720
the answer to this so

477
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,040
to me it seems obvious that if you're at

478
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,360
the polls the whole system falls apart

479
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,279
right you can run around and be in all

480
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,959
the time zones you can jump across and

481
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:46,000
you know

482
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,360
how does that work how does it actually

483
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,600
work practically in antarctica so what

484
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,839
you've got here is all of the

485
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,480
antarctic research stations

486
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,000
and the kind of dull answer when i got

487
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,440
to the bottom of it is that they more or

488
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,759
less follow wherever their host country

489
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,519
is you know so the

490
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:04,000
the british um would follow uk time they

491
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,680
would also observe daylight saving time

492
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,120
even though they really don't need to in

493
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,279
antarctica

494
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:11,519
but it keeps you in sync with your host

495
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,480
country

496
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:14,160
and sometimes they

497
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,800
hold the sort of same

498
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
time as their whether being server like

499
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,320
a supply station or something like new

500
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,519
zealand perhaps they might keep new

501
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,639
zealand time because that makes more

502
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,040
sense so just practicality is what that

503
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,880
was going with and this other thing

504
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,320
turned out when i was digging through it

505
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,240
which amused me as well as like not only

506
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,000
have you got you know six months of

507
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,000
daylight and six months of night time

508
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,800
and

509
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,959
keeping wacky clocks to whatever your

510
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,959
host nation or the clocks don't actually

511
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:41,680
work very well um they seem to go a bit

512
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,920
fast so yeah i can't imagine what

513
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,360
there's probably a good thriller in that

514
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,959
like things going wrong and when things

515
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,720
actually happen or something

516
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,399
all right something sensible let's do

517
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,560
dell exciting time

518
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,759
i think the way to understand daylight

519
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,680
saving time actually the way to come at

520
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,959
it is to look at daylight patterns

521
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,959
across the earth and that's a kind of

522
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:00,399
useful way and so we'll look at the

523
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,480
extremes we'll look at equator so the

524
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,559
equator you've pretty much got

525
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:07,039
12 hours of my time 12 hours of daytime

526
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,919
there's not really a lot of variation um

527
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,199
so you could move it i mean you could

528
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:12,880
apply dst and just you know move

529
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,240
everything by an hour but why would you

530
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,359
you know

531
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:16,959
it's probably inconvenient to move your

532
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,559
clocks for no reason

533
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,959
and the polls are more extreme

534
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,480
like i've said before about antarctica

535
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,720
you know you've got 12 hours of daylight

536
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,359
12 hours of that's right you have six

537
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,080
months of of daylight six months of

538
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,000
night time or you know a month of

539
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,760
twilight in between so you can move the

540
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,880
clocks as much as you like but it's

541
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,240
really not going to make any difference

542
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,679
whatsoever you get more of the same just

543
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,280
be moving it so

544
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
um so where you actually get daylight

545
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,520
saving time is in these sort of

546
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,679
uh temperate bands if you like so of

547
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:49,120
europe um or australia perhaps you know

548
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,799
anywhere but there's variation over the

549
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,679
course of the course of the year um and

550
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:55,600
the purpose of it really is to try and

551
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:58,000
extend the amount of natural light

552
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,480
you're getting in the evening

553
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,919
in the summer because obviously you

554
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:03,360
don't get as much in the i'm talking

555
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,880
about the northern hemisphere but you

556
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,640
know let's say you live in greenwich you

557
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,640
get up at six o'clock in the morning

558
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
um in the winter you can see from here

559
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,240
that you're actually getting up in the

560
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,760
dark like we've all kind of experienced

561
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,400
this

562
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,160
and anything below that line is stuff

563
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,840
you're sleeping through right so there's

564
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,120
a lot of natural light there that you're

565
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
going to sleep through in the summer

566
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,200
so the point of that of daylight saving

567
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,640
time is to kind of extend that by

568
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,480
shifting the clocks so that's what it

569
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,080
looks like when you shift the clocks

570
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,520
everything moves up and you get an extra

571
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:31,039
hour of daylight in the evening so

572
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,960
that's the purpose of it

573
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,400
um

574
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,000
it's usually attributed to ben franklin

575
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,200
ah really not no he i mean he was he

576
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,120
wrote a humorous essay

577
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,520
in which he suggests um he makes

578
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,600
calculations for how much candle wax you

579
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,240
could save in paris um

580
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,400
he suggests firing cannons to wake

581
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,080
people up um

582
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,799
so he's kind of playing with the idea of

583
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,120
getting people up early um but there's

584
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,799
no notion of putting clocks forward and

585
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:03,039
back or anything like that yet um this

586
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,960
is the first series proposal um george

587
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,520
hudson he was from london he moved to

588
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
new zealand and he was a keen

589
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,600
entomologist so he wanted some time to

590
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,520
look for insects basically yeah he

591
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,640
wanted a couple more hours in the

592
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,400
evening he pitched it to the wellington

593
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,320
philosophical society

594
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,320
they were actually quite um receptive

595
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,000
they were quite keen um but in the end

596
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,120
it didn't really happen so this was

597
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:28,799
picked up in 1907 by william willett uh

598
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,440
he was a successful london builder

599
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,039
and his so his

600
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
the buildings and houses that he made

601
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,240
were famous for their kind of use of

602
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,080
natural daylight so this was kind of on

603
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,760
his mind

604
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,160
fun fact he is also chris martin's great

605
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,160
great great granddad i think as well but

606
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,039
i don't know what you would do with that

607
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:46,640
information but there you go

608
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,559
um he produced this pamphlet called the

609
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,200
waste of daylight um

610
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,280
here's what he was suggesting

611
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,960
it would be good why you might want to

612
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,280
do it essentially it was about energy

613
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,640
you know you can save a lot of energy if

614
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,000
you don't have to run

615
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,720
uh lighting in the evening so

616
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,480
um he got quite a lot of support i mean

617
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,039
he pushed this entire life um

618
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,880
winston churchill gave speeches on his

619
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,600
behalf saying you know the extolling the

620
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,840
virtues of daylight saving time

621
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,160
um

622
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:15,360
[Music]

623
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,679
but the first known example of it

624
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,000
actually being employed um comes from

625
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,400
canada this is thunder bay

626
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,000
in canada or called thunderbay now it

627
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,400
was fort william back then

628
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:29,039
um and fort william and another

629
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:30,960
neighboring town

630
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,640
adopted daylight saving time so it's in

631
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,760
the records there there may well be

632
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,200
others but that's that's the only one we

633
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,200
know of at the moment and the first

634
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,360
country to use it is actually um germany

635
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:41,840
in world war ii um they were again they

636
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,000
were using it to try and save coal save

637
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,559
energy um and the allies jumped on board

638
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:48,640
pretty soon afterwards um a lot of

639
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:49,520
europe

640
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,360
adopted it as well so

641
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,480
um during wartime britain was on double

642
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,919
summer time so we were effectively on

643
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:57,520
european time you know we kind of

644
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,840
shifted if the europeans were in summer

645
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,240
time then we've jumped two and we were

646
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,440
on the same which makes sense if you're

647
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,480
trying to coordinate a war the last

648
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:05,840
thing you want to be

649
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,000
trying to get off by one error you know

650
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
in your in your clocks so

651
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,159
um in 2016 i don't want to say

652
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,480
celebrated marked shall we say they

653
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,120
accept 100 years of daylight saving time

654
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,240
um

655
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,840
there's a good exhibition at the royal

656
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,080
observatory um worth the visit if you at

657
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,320
the time so i'm going to look quickly

658
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,000
now at dst parents way of the world

659
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,080
because one of the things is it's within

660
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,559
territories not everybody

661
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,559
not every part of the territory wants to

662
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,919
sometimes something like australia like

663
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,000
in the north they observe it but in the

664
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,840
south they don't um

665
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,799
canada

666
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,799
in the yukon they they don't in

667
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,559
saskatchewan they don't but other places

668
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,840
do

669
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:46,400
my favorite is america america is really

670
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,679
unusual hawaii doesn't um and bits of

671
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:52,159
arizona don't

672
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,600
so

673
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,039
what you've got here is you can see the

674
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,200
red parts the arizona

675
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,799
officially do not observe daylight

676
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:00,320
saving time but you'll notice there's a

677
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,320
kind of patch there i've got it in blue

678
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:04,240
i'm hoping that comes up and you can see

679
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:07,120
it that blue area is the navajo indian

680
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,360
reservation and it stretches out into

681
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:13,039
utah new mexico and utah and new mexico

682
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,880
observed daylight saving time so the

683
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,360
navajo indian reservation also observes

684
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,760
it even though it's in arizona

685
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,159
however there's a little red spot in the

686
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,840
middle there that's the hopi indian

687
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:26,480
reservation um

688
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,360
it being entirely within arizona

689
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,559
it does not observe daylight saving time

690
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,799
yeah

691
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,200
so we have dst news this was weird like

692
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,200
i pitched this in january february and

693
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,480
then march comes around and usa votes to

694
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,159
put daylight saving time permanent

695
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,600
daylight saving time um in 2023 well it

696
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,039
has passed the senate it hasn't passed

697
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,960
the house so who knows they've also gone

698
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,720
down this road before and reverted it in

699
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,240
the 70s so

700
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
i don't know if it'll happen we'll see

701
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,520
europe's also kind of in the same boat

702
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:00,400
europe voted in 2018 to stop observing

703
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,640
dst britain being part of europe that

704
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,240
time was also with this but um there's

705
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
just been a lot going on and they

706
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,200
haven't had a chance to

707
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,360
to do it so both eu and uk observed it

708
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,960
this year but i suspect at some point in

709
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
the future they'll get round to

710
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,880
um making that happen

711
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,799
i can't really leave it without trying

712
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,240
to cover the pros and cons this is kind

713
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:21,919
of a modern take on it basically it's

714
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,520
good for the economy you know with an

715
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,520
extra hour at night people go to bars

716
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,600
people go traveling and

717
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,600
it boosts the economy by by a decent

718
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,520
number which is the kind of main purpose

719
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:34,640
for doing it um cons really you're

720
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,480
giving yourself jet lag it's just

721
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,520
horrible you know you're putting

722
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,799
yourself forward an hour and there's all

723
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,799
sorts of heart attacks and accidents

724
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,720
that go up as a result of the shift from

725
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,799
one to another so

726
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,200
okay to answer the question of computers

727
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,960
somewhere i'm sure you've all got a

728
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:50,880
phone in your pocket or something like

729
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,159
that so

730
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:53,679
there's a decent chance you're running

731
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,679
android or ios or this being emf you

732
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,720
wrote your own who knows

733
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,080
but if it's anywhere so unix or linux

734
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,279
based

735
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,279
there's a pretty good chance it has a

736
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,880
copy of the time zone database within it

737
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,679
um

738
00:24:09,679 --> 00:24:11,200
timezone database has many names it's

739
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
been around since the 80s

740
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,840
86 that get started so

741
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,000
this is what it is it is a database that

742
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,159
contains this is from their faq so i can

743
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
get it right it contains code and data

744
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,480
that represent the history of local time

745
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,480
for many representative locations around

746
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:27,919
the globe they cannot skirt around the

747
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,559
language there it's updated periodically

748
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:32,080
to reflect all of the things i've just

749
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,320
talked about so utc offsets delete

750
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:37,039
saving time blah blah blah

751
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:38,559
the most surprising thing if you've not

752
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,720
come across it is it's an open source

753
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,000
project

754
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,600
and it's run entirely by volunteers like

755
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,360
emf like this this is an entirely

756
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,520
volunteer driven project but it's

757
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,279
fundamental to the internet like you

758
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:51,279
know if this thing wasn't there

759
00:24:51,279 --> 00:24:53,520
um you'd have to set your own phone be

760
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
disastrous right yeah

761
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,120
um there was a talk earlier this year

762
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,960
from paul eggert who is the current

763
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,039
maintainer and he goes into a lot of the

764
00:25:01,039 --> 00:25:02,720
history on this so if you're interested

765
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,240
in the history specifically of this i

766
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,840
recommend that talk i will link to it

767
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,679
and tweet it later on if you're if

768
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:08,960
you're up for it

769
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,919
um

770
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,840
here's how the process works so there's

771
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,559
a mailing list and if you're at all

772
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:15,840
interested in time zones then you can

773
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:17,039
join the mailing anyone can join the

774
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,360
mailing list um here's an example of an

775
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,559
email that came in

776
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:23,840
in march and it's from the palestine

777
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,520
ministry of telecom and information

778
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,520
technology saying here are the dst rules

779
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:29,840
for palestine for this year

780
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,320
um that gets turned into an entry in the

781
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:33,840
database which looks a bit like this and

782
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,159
this was turned around in like

783
00:25:36,159 --> 00:25:37,840
a week you know it was done very very

784
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:38,880
fast

785
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:39,679
um

786
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:40,559
and then

787
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,880
what happens is the upstream

788
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,120
um you know if you're on debian or

789
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,039
booter or whatever you know that they

790
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,320
bring that version in and then it's

791
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:49,520
rolled out to all the other operating

792
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,240
systems here's kind of looks up close

793
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,760
um

794
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,000
the rule at the bottom is human readable

795
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,679
you have to trust me i think most

796
00:25:57,679 --> 00:25:59,440
techies would read that the thing about

797
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,600
is that gets compiled for all the

798
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,480
various systems as well um the most

799
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,159
interesting thing i think is all of the

800
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,799
comments there's some fantastic um sort

801
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,360
of notes on the history of time zones

802
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
and daylight saving and all sorts of you

803
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:15,520
know politics behind it um it's on

804
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,200
github you can look it up it's it's well

805
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,440
worth a couple of hours your time

806
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:20,400
um

807
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,440
and to finish this is

808
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,360
you've all seen this this feels right to

809
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,760
me about the timezone database um

810
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,080
there are some threats to it uh it was

811
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,360
sued in 2011. um there was a some heated

812
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,440
discussion on the on the mailing list

813
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:38,320
last year um but it is fundamental to

814
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,520
the internet and we cannot afford to

815
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,760
lose it so i know i'd like to think by

816
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
thanking the maintainers of the tz

817
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,799
database frankly because you know my

818
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:46,480
phone works um

819
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:50,039
so with that i am

820
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,158
you
