1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,480
[Applause]

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,000
um which this make this mate

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,799
left

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,300
okay this one great hello so I've never

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,280
been to EMF I thought maybe there'll be

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,680
like 20 people in a tent this is so many

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,539
people hello

8
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:19,380
um

9
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:22,320
so uh if this goes a bit too fast or a

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,359
bit too detailed then we put all the

11
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:25,619
notes on a

12
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,960
um a page that we'll share at the end

13
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,119
so I run a studio called Geeks for

14
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,619
social change which I started in about

15
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,500
2015. this kind of came out of a desire

16
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,180
to blend together kind of activism

17
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,640
technology and research

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,500
so sort of by actually working within

19
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,079
Community groups to make things better

20
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,539
at my heart I'm kind of more of a

21
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:47,640
scrappy activist than anything else

22
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,680
um I'm kind of really embedded in sort

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,180
of feminist trans abolitionist

24
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,640
anti-racist politics and I just couldn't

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,440
see myself represented anywhere in Tech

26
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,480
and a lot of the existing stuff out

27
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,399
there just felt really wide of the mark

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:01,760
for me

29
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,019
um so as I'll get on to in this talk I

30
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:05,700
was also just really burnt out from

31
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,020
doing this activism

32
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,060
and wanted to do something joyful and

33
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,159
fun and to be able to deliver projects

34
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:13,020
with a sort of very fully automated

35
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:15,060
luxury queer communism Vibe which is

36
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,860
kind of you can probably tell from my

37
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,840
cardigan

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,180
um so to get away from the coal face a

39
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,799
lot of activism can get at where you get

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,360
really burnt out and sort of actually

41
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,100
start building this world we keep

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,320
talking that we want to live in

43
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,180
so this Talk's going to go through how

44
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,799
we've been doing

45
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,360
um the work we've got planned and like

46
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,860
maybe how you can take part if you want

47
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,840
to talk to us

48
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,860
so part one is about making a

49
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,259
just making as the basis for

50
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:45,899
experiencing Joy

51
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:48,240
so I imagine almost everyone here uses

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,640
making coding producing sewing sculpting

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,560
or whatever your creative output is as a

54
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,200
form of coping right so the world sucks

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,119
but I can make a nice thing and it kind

56
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
of gives my life value

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,280
it feels like we we can't change the

58
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,899
world or it's

59
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,240
um but we can make some cool doodads and

60
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,098
this process kind of is therapeutic it

61
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,080
keeps us mindful lets us use our hands

62
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,420
work in non-hierarchical ways and

63
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:14,040
generally you know mess around and find

64
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,040
out with sort of low stakes

65
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,800
I think this is really really deep and

66
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:20,640
something that doesn't get enough

67
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,040
attention and at the core of often what

68
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,660
gives our lives meaning on what we

69
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,580
Center our identities around however

70
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,379
we're not really living in a society

71
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:30,000
that allows this joy to be at the

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
Forefront of our lives and it's often

73
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,560
something we have to fit into the cracks

74
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
so I've got a long quote here oh hang on

75
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,900
my my notes just went ah

76
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,420
so

77
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,099
let me get this up

78
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:45,959
so this to those quote which I read out

79
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:47,700
so we live in a world which is generally

80
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,099
disagreeable where not only people but

81
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:51,599
established Powers have a stake in

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,540
transmitting sad effects to us

83
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,819
sadness sad affects or all those which

84
00:02:56,819 --> 00:02:59,340
reduce our power to act the established

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,780
Powers need our sadness to make us

86
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,459
slaves and this kind of goes on but the

87
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,319
gist of this is it's like there's this

88
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:05,819
force of the world which is preventing

89
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,980
us from doing things which make us happy

90
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,019
essentially

91
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:12,599
so deloz here talks about desire of

92
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,280
production as the basis for our being

93
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,019
and this is an additive process that

94
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:18,120
drives us be it everything from sort of

95
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,099
like the desire to go for a wee to eat a

96
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,080
burger to play with your phone to like

97
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,879
design a Shader on stage or build

98
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,739
something out of scaffolding or turn

99
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:26,879
mercury into gold or all the other

100
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,840
things we've seen this weekend

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,580
so like this kind of comes on to this

102
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,080
doing stuff as an escape from the

103
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,400
drudgery

104
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,540
um

105
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,280
a lot of the effort that's needed to

106
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,720
begin and maintain these things is

107
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,700
really something that needs attention

108
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,620
so many people I think have got jobs

109
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,120
they hate or think are kind of useless

110
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,940
and do this stuff in the weekends and

111
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,620
the gaps to feel valued

112
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:51,900
um David Graber pointed out that the

113
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,400
more you get paid like the less likely

114
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,080
your job is to have value to society and

115
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:56,040
he's written a whole book about it

116
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,360
called jobs that's very good

117
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,760
and I recommend it so we learn all these

118
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,260
skills and then often the daytime

119
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,760
application seems boring and we do this

120
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:05,400
stuff in the evening

121
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
um

122
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,379
so like making is literally our escape

123
00:04:10,379 --> 00:04:13,140
from oppressive power structures

124
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:13,799
um

125
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:15,659
so you know

126
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:17,100
um these are the things that we don't

127
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,358
necessarily have to jump through hoops

128
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,699
to do so they exist in this space where

129
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,259
we can do our Niche interests with our

130
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,360
friends that bring us joy and we can do

131
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,040
it actually like collaboratively and

132
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,320
collectively

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,479
so I would say like joy in this context

134
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:31,979
doesn't mean the joy you get from sort

135
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:33,540
of like going to a party getting drunk

136
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,340
taking drugs whatever you want to do I

137
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,479
think I'm talking here about the

138
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,220
satisfaction of like setting your mind

139
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,960
to a really hard problem or a really

140
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,020
hard Challenge and then fixing it or for

141
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,120
some value of fixing it you know I think

142
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,800
this stuff makes you feel alive and it

143
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,360
gives you a feeling of agency and like

144
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,860
you you can do something and I think

145
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,479
this is more a kind of like months and

146
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,400
years not days and weeks feeling

147
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:55,560
generally

148
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,259
doing good projects can be one of the

149
00:04:58,259 --> 00:04:59,820
the most rewarding things and I think

150
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:01,620
anyone who's been part of a big event or

151
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:03,120
a group or a festival probably feels

152
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,800
this and that's probably in large part

153
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,240
why people are here today to share what

154
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,100
they've been working on

155
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,960
it can form part of your identity and it

156
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,340
literally changes how you think about

157
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,800
the world and how you interact with it

158
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,259
so to summarize doing and making stuff

159
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:18,600
is not just fun but possibly like a

160
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,160
really basic form of interacting with

161
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:21,240
the universe

162
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,979
so like capitalism is kind of bad and

163
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:25,199
gets in the way of this and yeah if you

164
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,940
think it sounds like I'm describing

165
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,100
communism you're probably right um I

166
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,660
should look into that

167
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,580
so

168
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,979
the difficulty then comes when you want

169
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:37,820
to do it with other people

170
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,780
and this is where it gets hard because

171
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,639
like people are messy and relationships

172
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:44,580
are messy and the world we live is messy

173
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,320
so this might be sort of taking your

174
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,880
personal practice instead of doing it by

175
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,039
yourself setting up a hackspace forming

176
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:52,199
a Dungeons and Dragons group or a

177
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,120
knitting Circle or going LARPing making

178
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,280
a Minecraft server maybe even just a

179
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,800
weekly meet up at the pub

180
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,600
um it could also be trying to mobilize

181
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,699
some friends to go to a protest form a

182
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,860
mutual Aid group or like a trans clothes

183
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:07,740
swap like a Zine fair or putting on sort

184
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:09,780
of a vaguely political film festival or

185
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,039
organizing a club night for a

186
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:13,800
minoritized group you know the the Gap

187
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,240
here between political and non-political

188
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,919
is very blurred you know the person is

189
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:18,780
political

190
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,620
um

191
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,300
so there's no real clear distinction

192
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,560
here although there's kind of obviously

193
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,419
a spectrum

194
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,400
so while the core of these activities is

195
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,860
very different the actual activity

196
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,360
um becomes the same you're You're

197
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,699
Building relationships and literally

198
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:34,259
like Community organizing for whatever

199
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:37,759
value of community you're working with

200
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,080
um again these relationships can be the

201
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,400
ones that give our lives meaning these

202
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,199
are our friends our family the people we

203
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,580
work with the people we feel comfortable

204
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,220
with the people we're not sort of like

205
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,300
obliged to hang out with like we are

206
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,099
with you know sort of like colleagues or

207
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:53,039
government or other people

208
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,840
it's important to note that like we're

209
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,979
not really taught how to work

210
00:06:55,979 --> 00:06:58,259
cooperatively at any point in our

211
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,660
educational work systems people are very

212
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,699
used to being in these rigid structures

213
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,080
and they have a boss they moan about and

214
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,639
underlings that they do whatever they

215
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:06,419
want

216
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,099
so despite the fact it's more or less

217
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:10,680
the default way of doing hobby groups we

218
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,560
don't really learn about doing consensus

219
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,840
conflict resolution restorative justice

220
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,160
or a bunch of other things that would

221
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:18,539
really help

222
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,220
so this kind of organizing stuff with

223
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,720
other people can get really tricky just

224
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:22,979
because we're kind of missing this human

225
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,340
relationship toolkit

226
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,080
so it's this relationship work that's

227
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,160
kind of now where I'm going to start

228
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,380
focusing on

229
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:33,060
so

230
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,919
um this is a kind of key concept we've

231
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,360
used in our work a lot the differences

232
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,680
between communities of place and

233
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,840
communities of Interest so we all exist

234
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,400
within both

235
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,020
and they kind of they're worth like

236
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,819
thinking about a little bit

237
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:47,039
so a community of place is basically

238
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,780
just where we live

239
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:50,340
it's our immediate neighborhood the

240
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:52,199
things we walk past every day

241
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:53,639
so I think this used to be the main

242
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,440
space which would be what you would

243
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,139
consider like community life like

244
00:07:58,139 --> 00:07:59,940
um sometimes you know someone asks you

245
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,080
where you live you don't save the city

246
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:03,180
you say like your ward or your town

247
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,280
but so now this can feel very alienating

248
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,020
I think especially to people who live in

249
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,840
in cities I live in a really mix in a

250
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,000
city area which is Hume in Manchester if

251
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,860
anyone knows it and it's kind of

252
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,599
enormously divided by age there's a

253
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:16,979
student population that keeps itself to

254
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:19,139
itself the older people live in a lot of

255
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,460
these like cul-de-sacs with their own

256
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,840
community centers and they kind of don't

257
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,900
mix I mean the university is literally

258
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,340
erected these gigantic fences to keep

259
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,840
them in too so it doesn't really help

260
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,000
but you kind of end up with like you've

261
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,139
got you know

262
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,539
on the ground people can live near each

263
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,099
other in ways that are kind of invisible

264
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:36,839
even though it seems like we live in the

265
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:38,339
same place

266
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:41,399
so like this is still somewhat

267
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,019
self-selecting like where you live at

268
00:08:43,019 --> 00:08:45,180
Birth is still probably the single

269
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,120
biggest predictor of your life chances

270
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
but in the reality world we live in this

271
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:52,440
is probably a lot more like the finger

272
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,940
quotes real world than the sort of

273
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,800
self-select selecting hobby groups we

274
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,620
end up with kind of online or again over

275
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,959
a larger area

276
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,120
um you could end up sort of working in

277
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,680
this sort of sub-sub sub subset of a

278
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,640
city

279
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,459
so communities of Interest are kind of

280
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:10,019
exactly what they sound like

281
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,519
um I think this is what most people are

282
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,500
here they'll be in a hackspace group or

283
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,040
a friendship group around an interest

284
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,140
um I think the rise of the internet

285
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,200
has made these far easier to do and

286
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,580
they've sort of shoved out communities

287
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,800
of place to some extent

288
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,480
the interplay between these can be

289
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,320
really

290
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,660
hard and I think this is why it can feel

291
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,120
so hard to get stuff done right now

292
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,339
um we're sort of in this new era where

293
00:09:35,339 --> 00:09:36,839
such a large proportion of the internet

294
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:40,140
is like very online in ways that are

295
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,060
controlled by gigantic companies who

296
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,440
directly set what behaviors are

297
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,800
accessible or like discoverable

298
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
this is both kind of increased

299
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,700
alienation between people who are on and

300
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,779
offline

301
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:54,180
but also kind of like Within These

302
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,339
communities so online communities you

303
00:09:56,339 --> 00:09:58,680
know famously tend to you get into scene

304
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,240
drama very quickly

305
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,040
so on some level we're working on a

306
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,200
crossover between the two

307
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,079
the size of the geography expands as the

308
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:09,600
size of our interest gets more Niche so

309
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,519
for example if I think about trans

310
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,440
organizing this makes no sense on award

311
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,300
level which is about you know 10 000

312
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,100
dish people because there's a group

313
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,540
that's about point three to point five

314
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:20,160
percent of the population we need to

315
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:21,600
cast a wider net

316
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,459
but on the flip side if I'm thinking

317
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,800
about protecting a local park or meeting

318
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,540
neighbors for coffee I'm thinking you

319
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
know a couple hundred meters from my

320
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,260
house and also like everyone else is

321
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,060
going to have their own place they go

322
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,620
for coffee in their own local park so

323
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,820
you're not expecting that to be of

324
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:39,240
interest outside of where you are

325
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:41,220
um but you know these things Silo fast

326
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,440
so interest groups then you know it ends

327
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,060
up being kind of like death metal genres

328
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,440
where you're kind of like oh no we hate

329
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:47,940
them they hate us

330
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,860
and this scene drama can kind of take

331
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,300
over

332
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,620
um so I think this sort of like real

333
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:54,060
thinking about returning to communities

334
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,040
of place and trying to leave our comfort

335
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,660
zone of communities of interest is kind

336
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,380
of an important thing

337
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,120
and then I just say

338
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,000
doing it under the Tories sucks

339
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,899
um

340
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:09,060
I hope this isn't very controversial for

341
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,140
this audience

342
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,800
but it's extremely disempowering

343
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,180
um it feels like talking about

344
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:18,000
possibility and change whilst it's we're

345
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,800
struggling to exist so you know we've

346
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,120
kind of got this intersecting cost of

347
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,700
living crisis the ongoing pandemic the

348
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,019
corrupt and often fascist government

349
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,880
there's a social isolation and

350
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,920
loneliness crisis an upswing and

351
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,959
structural racism and hate crime and

352
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,279
kind of Highly coordinated and

353
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:34,019
well-funded attacks on trans people that

354
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:36,180
are creating an incredibly intolerant

355
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,620
environment for making any kind of

356
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:38,820
change happen

357
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:40,800
I think covered especially has torn

358
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
apart a lot of the normal functionings

359
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,860
of how student groups especially

360
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,959
integrate with local communities that

361
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:48,899
we're still sort of coming to understand

362
00:11:48,899 --> 00:11:51,740
let's get some water

363
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,500
I think a lot of us

364
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,240
especially who are perhaps if you're

365
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:59,399
like two or more

366
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:01,440
of kind of trans disabled person of

367
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,240
color neurodiversion working class

368
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,220
square carers and not all of these to be

369
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,320
clear and other marginalized groups have

370
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,820
sort of never been further from kind of

371
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,579
political representation

372
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:13,800
um the party sucks the alternative to

373
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:15,420
that party sucks the Alternatives of

374
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,579
that party sucks and at some point we're

375
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:19,139
kind of all the way over here and I

376
00:12:19,139 --> 00:12:20,700
think um

377
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,320
we've then got this billionaire price

378
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,880
that only allows certain stuff to come

379
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,440
through and whatever the hell is going

380
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:28,760
on with social media right now

381
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:31,139
so a lot of us not only see no

382
00:12:31,139 --> 00:12:33,360
representation of ourselves at all

383
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,519
we maybe through our community of

384
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:36,600
interest and that's it which is another

385
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,820
thing that tethers it to it we've kind

386
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:39,839
of

387
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,800
um

388
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
these sort of daily attacks on our kind

389
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,399
of ability to exist

390
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,899
so to be clear I do really respect

391
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,040
people who are trying to make change in

392
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,420
these systems I'm just finding

393
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:50,160
increasingly I'm giving up my friends

394
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:51,660
are giving up the networks I'm giving up

395
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,519
with and we're trying to come back to

396
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,200
this sense of like what can we do on the

397
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,700
ground to make

398
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:00,860
Joy happen in our immediate communities

399
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,620
um

400
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,880
I'd say too that

401
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,320
injecting these sort of big p politics

402
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,079
into our work unfolding really confusing

403
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,240
and complex ways honestly there's

404
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,980
something really cringe feeling about

405
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,959
talking about any politics which I think

406
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,060
is maybe why I'm so nervous I feel like

407
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:22,500
everyone I talk to who does anything

408
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:23,880
related to activism or Community

409
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,440
organizing they hate all the terms all

410
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,240
the terminology the culture and all of

411
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,680
it

412
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,120
um

413
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,519
but yeah you know I'm very much working

414
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,440
on being cringe and being free

415
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,940
feels good

416
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,600
um

417
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,700
I think a lot of this stems from the

418
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,500
fact that people think of activism as

419
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,480
being like going to a protest or kind of

420
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,699
being obnoxious on Twitter and for many

421
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,440
people that is the front door at least

422
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,420
has been historically but I think we

423
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,240
simply have to find better ways

424
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
of being more able to resist the State

425
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,540
of Affairs that are kind of inherently

426
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,060
joyful sustainable inclusive can pay

427
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:59,339
people a wage to do so could censor the

428
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,540
needs of structurally marginalized

429
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:03,540
people and take us back excuse me

430
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,220
so what math is all about this which is

431
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,839
kind of enabling the sense of collective

432
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:08,880
Joy from which I think Springs or

433
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,959
resistance effectively

434
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,940
there's a real talking about injecting

435
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,560
politics into everyday life there's a

436
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,500
real um issue here so I was in we were

437
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,880
invited here to do this talk under this

438
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:22,560
kind of equality diversity and inclusion

439
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,760
banner and I think it's just worth

440
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,980
saying like you know the festival isn't

441
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,480
very diverse realizes it it's trying to

442
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,620
fix it which I think a lot of

443
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,000
organizations are doing right now which

444
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,079
is great

445
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,699
there's a lot of structural reasons why

446
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:34,320
this is the case that a bit too personal

447
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:36,660
to get into but I think and the idea of

448
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100
it being someone's fault isn't

449
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,320
necessarily helpful but I think it's

450
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,579
good to look at the structural issues

451
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,639
behind this so This study kind of blew

452
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,399
my mind when I read it which said that

453
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:49,620
men have five hours more Leisure Time a

454
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:52,260
week than women

455
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,899
so like this is a whole hobby I mean how

456
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:56,339
many things do we spend five hours a

457
00:14:56,339 --> 00:14:57,600
week doing

458
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,100
and like you know there's the side of

459
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,139
all this free late of this um finger

460
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:02,820
quotes free labor

461
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,440
that is radically classed engendered

462
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,060
they've not done this study based on

463
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:07,620
other demographic factors they only have

464
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,500
this number and I'd love to know more

465
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,540
um but I think just thinking about the

466
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,160
freedom of having Leisure Time and

467
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,839
having so much of it and people having

468
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,880
different quantities of it is something

469
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,959
that really needs like some

470
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,420
consideration

471
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,500
um

472
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,220
whoops

473
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,399
and I've lost my place again be right

474
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,360
with you

475
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:32,839
okay

476
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,480
so and I think the problem that we get

477
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,759
into here comes because because there's

478
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,560
such this unequal distribution of free

479
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,899
time what we do in that time tends to

480
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:44,880
represent it and kind of comes around

481
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,800
this sort of

482
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,600
accidentally quite sort of normal

483
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,399
normative kind of Grace and Perry calls

484
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,079
it like the default man you know who has

485
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,399
the free time to do this and everyone

486
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:55,259
else needs kind of an extra affordance

487
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:57,540
to be part of this

488
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:01,139
so in the context of disability studies

489
00:16:01,139 --> 00:16:03,660
I got this quote from just boys if it's

490
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:05,759
did we put that on a slide

491
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,579
oop as the thing stopped

492
00:16:08,579 --> 00:16:11,220
oh sorry there we go this is kind of a

493
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,779
long quote

494
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:14,699
um so but I think it's important to read

495
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:15,899
out so

496
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:17,820
why does the idea of disability being

497
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,980
creative and avant-garde seem so absurd

498
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,839
is it because of the taken for granted

499
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,519
assumptions about disabled people that

500
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,139
they are in need of the help of others a

501
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:27,600
passive consumers of services constitute

502
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,820
a minority of individuals in society who

503
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,560
unfortunately must bear the brunt of

504
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,779
their own medical problems What If

505
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:35,040
instead we see that rethinking

506
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,600
disability enables us to explore

507
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,100
critically and creatively assumptions

508
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,259
about disability and ability

509
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:42,120
which in turn can offer better ways of

510
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,620
understanding the implications of both

511
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,720
bodily diversity and everyday social

512
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:47,820
spatial practice so this is from an

513
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:49,620
architect who wrote this but I think

514
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,220
this could sort of be um applied to most

515
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,660
contexts we work in right where it's

516
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,060
like if we put this idea of

517
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,820
who are we including first it creates

518
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:01,320
different interesting challenges that

519
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,820
are just as um

520
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,899
interesting to solve

521
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,220
so I think anyone who's tried to

522
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,780
organize anything

523
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:13,079
will know how hard it is

524
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,640
um there's stuff you hear over and over

525
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,280
again where like people if you're trying

526
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,780
to get involved in things it can often

527
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,220
feel like oh I tried to join this

528
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,299
activist space and everyone was just

529
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,059
yelling at each other

530
00:17:23,059 --> 00:17:25,799
sometimes I'm doing the yelling

531
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:27,780
I think there's also the sense that

532
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,039
people involved in this space are

533
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,360
complete dicks

534
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,700
which is true some of the time and you

535
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,380
get in trouble for stuff because there's

536
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,360
a lot of other things going on in that

537
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,640
space and it um

538
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:40,740
or like the other the other way which is

539
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,700
you know you're trying to help out a

540
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,900
community center they don't really have

541
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,340
a volunteering program they don't get

542
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:46,200
back to you you sort of get you know

543
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,419
easily put off

544
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,340
and from the side of kind of trying to

545
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,260
organize a group it can be just as

546
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,660
frustrating so a really common thing is

547
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,340
like people come to you and they just

548
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,720
want to offer a skill for an hour and

549
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,980
actually it doesn't quite work like that

550
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,360
if we had something we could fix in an

551
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:01,679
hour someone would have probably done it

552
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:03,419
so you know like people thinking they

553
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:04,919
can fix homelessness with a poster or

554
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,160
something is like a real thing I've seen

555
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,900
or like you know someone says they'll

556
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,340
make a website it's a really common one

557
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,539
and it doesn't work and they don't

558
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:14,520
listen to anyone and it sort of hangs

559
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,840
around and there's all this awkward

560
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,940
half-life of like institutional websites

561
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,260
that are broken

562
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,120
or the or like they're just volunteers

563
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,500
come and promise the world and then just

564
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,640
like vanish off the face of the Earth

565
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,780
the next day

566
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,940
so like I say there's no easy fix to any

567
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,039
of this stuff it's just um we're kind of

568
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:32,160
dealing in this world of like unfunded

569
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,400
stuff that's made structurally hard

570
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,740
um in centers that have that have been

571
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,059
kind of cut and cut and cut over the

572
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,178
years

573
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:44,220
I think a lot of this happens because as

574
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,960
soon as you step outside of kind of come

575
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,640
you know these structures that might be

576
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,200
oppressive but people know their place

577
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,480
in kind of a hierarchy you start dealing

578
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,340
with these actual breakdowns and they

579
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,320
can be really jarring so structural

580
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:57,299
discrimination is really ugly operates

581
00:18:57,299 --> 00:18:59,160
on multiple scales

582
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,200
and the Dynamics have sort of existed

583
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:02,820
long before you got there and will exist

584
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,320
a long time after

585
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,820
putting your toe in can feel like it's

586
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,980
getting bitten off it takes a lot of

587
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,720
hard work to kind of start decolonizing

588
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,220
ourselves and learning the kind of

589
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,020
racist transphobic classes things I'm

590
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,640
still working on it

591
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,960
and it's kind of meeting people where

592
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:17,460
they are and they have the power and it

593
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,960
can be it can be it's really

594
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,299
disconcerting

595
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:23,039
so like we I don't have any answers for

596
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:25,380
this unfortunately I'm hoping that by

597
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:26,760
sort of bringing it up we can start to

598
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,980
have discussions about it but I'm now

599
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,179
going to talk about the work that we've

600
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,380
just started doing on Community

601
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,539
Technology Partnerships

602
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:36,200
ah

603
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:41,220
so we're trying to take a lot of this

604
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,640
good stuff

605
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,660
this kind of desire to make the desire

606
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,860
to do things to do them with your

607
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,600
friends

608
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,160
and kind of put it together in a way

609
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,720
that overcomes these ideas more from the

610
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,740
ground up

611
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,120
so we're still working through this we

612
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,559
got some funding we've got a couple of

613
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:57,240
years to work on it it kind of infuses

614
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,580
all of our work anyway so we'll you know

615
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:02,400
we'll be in the I'll probably go in the

616
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,260
the one with the picnic benches over by

617
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,580
the main tent if people want to come and

618
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,780
talk about it we'd love to find out what

619
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:09,200
you're up to

620
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:13,799
um

621
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:15,780
so on the surface of it it seems simple

622
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:17,220
so yeah like I'm saying people have

623
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,600
skills they want to use Community groups

624
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,860
have unmet needs why is this so

625
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,600
difficult to happen

626
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,460
what we originally what we found is that

627
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:24,840
a lot of tech methodologies are actually

628
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,120
really unsuitable for this so the two of

629
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,440
the big ones I like design thinking and

630
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,480
human centered design and they sort of

631
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,860
Proclaim to be liberatory but if you

632
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,179
read through them it's still very much

633
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:34,260
of this idea that will sort of

634
00:20:34,260 --> 00:20:36,059
helicopter someone in put them on the

635
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:37,380
ground they'll fix a problem or take

636
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:38,580
them away and we kind of have this

637
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,740
experts and non-experts thing

638
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,840
it's taken quite a lot to sort of piece

639
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,659
to pull this apart

640
00:20:45,659 --> 00:20:47,520
where we're coming from from this

641
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,200
instead is this approach called the

642
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,840
capability approach

643
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,799
um

644
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,600
so this is kind of a human development

645
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,400
approach that's sort of used by the UN

646
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,559
and the for sustainable development

647
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,900
goals developed by Martha nusbauman and

648
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,460
Martin are the two really famous names

649
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,200
and it asks

650
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,120
quite simply what is it that people are

651
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,500
able to do

652
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,679
and be as a group

653
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,179
and then what things are getting in the

654
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:13,919
way of that what blockers are there and

655
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,320
how can we remove them so rather than it

656
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,580
sort of starting from this idea of the

657
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,960
thing we're trying to do like the one

658
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,000
thing we're sort of looking at the

659
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,559
hundred things that might be in your way

660
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:23,820
if you're trying to say set up a

661
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:26,520
community group or whatever

662
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,500
so this can seem like a simple question

663
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,120
but it's actually a very concrete

664
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,919
ethical test that represents people's

665
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,140
fundamental existence so rather than

666
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,760
having choices made for them on the

667
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:36,960
basis of kind of external

668
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
characteristics or assumptions of their

669
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,320
abilities that might come

670
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,640
you know if you're not a part of that

671
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,740
community

672
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,380
um it it re-centers the communities at

673
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,120
the center of interventions

674
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,799
so like by basing our work on this

675
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,000
approach rather than something that's

676
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,500
been kind of invented by you know

677
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,960
someone in California it usually is we

678
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:55,919
think we found a way to Recon

679
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:58,200
reconfigure this

680
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,059
so we call this community allergy

681
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,080
Partnerships

682
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:02,880
we think people are the best judges of

683
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,919
their own personal circumstances and the

684
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,200
best place to fix it

685
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
our approach to developing this has been

686
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,520
these um three stages that we've used a

687
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:12,900
few times now

688
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:14,520
so Step One is like direct engagement

689
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,620
with an involvement of which so you've

690
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:19,500
got to work directly with people

691
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,240
in a sort of place-based creative

692
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,580
partnership so you can have interest but

693
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,960
there has to be an element of play Space

694
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,039
because that's how you keep it honest

695
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:28,740
and kind of desilo it and then using

696
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,659
this to um actively enable the

697
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:31,919
realization of self-defined

698
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:33,539
opportunities for individuals and groups

699
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,400
so it's about working together to

700
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,400
improve our Collective capabilities

701
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,220
the explicit goal of this is that is to

702
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,260
increase our power to act

703
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:44,880
so if you've ever lived somewhere where

704
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:45,960
you don't think it's possible to get

705
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,340
anything done and then you've perhaps

706
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,960
moved City or come to a Maker Camp and

707
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,480
all of a sudden you're a wash with ideas

708
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,220
and possibilities and creativity and

709
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,539
meeting people that's kind of what we

710
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:57,120
want but like as like a day-to-day thing

711
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,860
and not like the rarified thing we get

712
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,899
to go to a few times a few times a year

713
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,799
to illustrate this this has been a lot

714
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:06,780
of theory I'll give you a few examples

715
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:08,100
from stuff that we've worked on with

716
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,500
various groups in our neighborhood

717
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,419
so the first one is a project called I'm

718
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:13,860
okay

719
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,600
we worked with a local no borders

720
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,460
Manchester group who wanted to create a

721
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,620
tool for their signing Support Network

722
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,360
so as part of the hostile environment

723
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,700
policy people seeking Asylum have to go

724
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:25,740
and sign into one of 14 like signing

725
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,480
centers in the UK

726
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,659
it's kind of a bit like a parole system

727
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:32,520
it's been report repeatedly described by

728
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,380
people as like the most dehumanizing

729
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,080
aspect of the whole Asylum process

730
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,400
there's an abolish reporting hashtag

731
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,600
that has a lot of stuff on it and

732
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,340
there's groups working on this

733
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,440
they tend to put these reporting centers

734
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,880
in the middle of nowhere

735
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,500
um there's kind of no seating or shelter

736
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,080
they're kind of in industrial Estates on

737
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,640
attending you get asked to arrange a

738
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,320
completely inane questions that just

739
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,419
seem no one can quite understand what

740
00:23:54,419 --> 00:23:55,860
they're trying to get to it seems just

741
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:58,260
to annoy you

742
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,059
but like at these centers The crucial

743
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:01,559
danger is if they do decide to deport

744
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:02,880
you even though they're not meant to

745
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,340
they will they will and have immediately

746
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,779
detained people drive them to the

747
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,100
airport and try to extradite them on

748
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,059
flights

749
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:11,580
so this whole process is incredibly

750
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,679
stressful because every time you go it's

751
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:14,940
kind of like you know maybe there's a 1

752
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,080
in 50 chance I'm just going to get

753
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,159
deported

754
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:18,960
so what the new wireless group have been

755
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,059
doing was doing this manually

756
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:22,799
um by standing outside registering

757
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,120
people when they go in checking they

758
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,980
come out

759
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,900
um this is requiring a massive amount of

760
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,820
labor on the ground

761
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,620
so they basically approached us and we

762
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,000
talked about this and what we've ended

763
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:35,100
up making is it's like a

764
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,260
a little piece of Bot software is MIT

765
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,000
license you can do what you want with it

766
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,779
but it it well uh it

767
00:24:42,779 --> 00:24:44,700
sets up a telegram bot

768
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,740
and people can just text in when they go

769
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,539
into a session and if they don't check

770
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,580
press out when they come out after 30

771
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:53,159
minutes the telegram group chat gets a

772
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:55,440
notification so the idea was we were

773
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,520
using all the tech they were already

774
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:58,200
using kind of mobile phones it works on

775
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,299
SMS and Telegram

776
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:01,980
and like

777
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,940
um

778
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,679
sadly we've not really got to test it

779
00:25:04,679 --> 00:25:06,000
because of the covered the changes in

780
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,559
covid they changed how they do it but

781
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:09,059
we're working on doing a proper pilot

782
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,880
and then a second release

783
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:14,100
um so yeah that's our first example it's

784
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:16,820
on our GitHub

785
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,900
the second example is kind of an even

786
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,520
simpler one you know the last one it was

787
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:22,020
like a very big social problem and we

788
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,400
ended up actually making quite a small

789
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,159
simple tool that like is designed for us

790
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:28,020
not even to own in the end and we think

791
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,760
it's got other applications

792
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,919
this was simply a case where when when

793
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,779
covet started in my neighborhood we've

794
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,279
got a lot of um

795
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,980
so a very deprived older population

796
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,260
the landlady at the community Pub

797
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,940
um was just like we need to do something

798
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,559
about this they had some family in Italy

799
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:44,400
and we're seeing what was happening

800
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,320
there so we had a group who was willing

801
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,240
to do deliveries which was Acorn a

802
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,919
renters Union we had

803
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:51,600
um one of these schemes where they

804
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,980
picked veg that's on the fields going

805
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:55,220
off

806
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,760
um and they had the kitchen and they had

807
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,020
the drivers and they just needed someone

808
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,700
to basically put it all together

809
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,200
so this ended up literally just being an

810
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,539
airtable database but it was kind of

811
00:26:03,539 --> 00:26:05,159
like well designed we did a proper

812
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:06,600
service design we got to think through

813
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,580
the problem we made a database that fit

814
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:10,559
it all together so it was probably ended

815
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,600
up being you know kind of a week's worth

816
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,760
of maybe not even a week's worth of tech

817
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:16,620
labor and this is now fed you know

818
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,240
delivered over 5000 meals to people's

819
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,360
house

820
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,740
the final example I'll give

821
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:25,020
is um this Flagship Tech we're working

822
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,340
on so hopefully we'll come and tell you

823
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:28,620
about next year called Place Carl

824
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,419
so this came out of a huge co-produced

825
00:26:30,419 --> 00:26:31,799
project that happened where I live in

826
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,880
Hume

827
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,380
they wanted to examine the causes of

828
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,539
social isolation loneliness for the over

829
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:38,940
50s was the focus of the project

830
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,559
this divested this had thousands of

831
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:42,240
conversations divested loads of money to

832
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,460
community groups and found this really

833
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,480
common thing where people thought

834
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,620
there's just nothing still in my

835
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,520
neighborhood

836
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,140
this has really led to like social

837
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:52,520
isolation up and down the country

838
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,059
um in the UK

839
00:26:54,059 --> 00:26:55,980
um there's estimated there'll be two

840
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,380
million up people who are lonely and

841
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,380
socially isolated by 2024

842
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:03,360
and there's like long-term longitudinal

843
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,279
studies that show that loneliness is as

844
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:06,480
bad for your health as smoking two

845
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,100
packets of cigarettes a week which is

846
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:11,220
crazy to me so despite these massive

847
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:12,779
Investments of time and money by like

848
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,580
City councils Health Providers housing

849
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,320
associations into like loads of

850
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:18,000
community directories

851
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:19,620
it they just weren't working the

852
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:21,000
information wasn't getting to people so

853
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,360
we went to find out why

854
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,320
let's have a bit more water

855
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,220
um I think I'm a little running out of

856
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,659
time

857
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:36,240
so very broadly speaking rather than

858
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,100
trying to do this as a kind of one-off

859
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,080
top down Tech intervention

860
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,340
we worked with all these local

861
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:42,960
Partnerships

862
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,940
to get them actually working together we

863
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
built some software that basically

864
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,240
Aggregates data from like Google

865
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,340
Calendar Outlook Facebook Meetup

866
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,200
Eventbrite whatever people were using

867
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,659
any kind of sorts it all and filters it

868
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:56,279
all out by region

869
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:57,659
and it's got a community of Interest

870
00:27:57,659 --> 00:28:00,059
hugging thing too

871
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:01,200
um I would love to go into this more and

872
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,399
we can talk about it later but I still

873
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,080
have two minutes left and then we also

874
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,520
designed a training program to go with

875
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,500
it so it was very much like this

876
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,940
three-tiered approach of like working

877
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,279
with local strategy

878
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,659
that's already there on the ground the

879
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:13,860
existing Partners in a neighborhood

880
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,840
using the technology that people already

881
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,220
had so we didn't expect them to install

882
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,840
another app we were often training them

883
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,039
to use things they already had on their

884
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:21,179
phone

885
00:28:21,179 --> 00:28:22,679
and then building a training program

886
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:24,480
around that so again using these tools

887
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,399
they already had

888
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,140
this worked incredibly shockingly well

889
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,940
and we ended up with about 250 events a

890
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,520
week for our little Ward we're currently

891
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,260
about working on a version for this for

892
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:35,580
the trans community in London called the

893
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,840
trans Dimension that will be launching

894
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,460
at the start of July so you can look out

895
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,360
for that

896
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,500
but we made this with gendered

897
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,760
intelligence

898
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,320
um who are lovely people and have been

899
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:44,520
coordinating a partnership there for

900
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,440
about 30 groups

901
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,640
so I'll leave you with some final

902
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,500
thoughts

903
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,899
um as I said we've got Lottery funding

904
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:53,880
to explore this idea and we've got a

905
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,380
little team together

906
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,580
um we'd love to find out what people are

907
00:28:56,580 --> 00:28:58,500
up to

908
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,700
um I will leave you with this final

909
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,840
quote

910
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:01,740
um

911
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,080
which is just which it says the space

912
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,399
beyond fixed and established order

913
00:29:05,399 --> 00:29:06,960
structures and morals is not one of

914
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,980
disorder

915
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,440
is the space of emergent Origins values

916
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:11,940
and forms of life so this is where we're

917
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,140
getting at we're not trying to make new

918
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,399
structures

919
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,380
we're trying to enable things to form

920
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,299
organically

921
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:19,919
and um

922
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:22,200
yeah I look forward to telling everyone

923
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,419
how we're doing this time next year

924
00:29:24,419 --> 00:29:25,799
um yeah if we've got some info here

925
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,240
we've got a Discord we've got some

926
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,039
little flies with our info on so um

927
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,530
thank you all for listening

928
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:40,450
[Applause]
