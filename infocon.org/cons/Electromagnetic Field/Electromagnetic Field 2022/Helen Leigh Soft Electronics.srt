1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,600
hello

2
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,240
it's bit weird being back isn't it

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,320
um first talk in three years so please

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,360
be gentle i shall try and uh

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,839
to share some good information for you

6
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
so um in this talk i'm going to be

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,119
giving you i'm going to start off with a

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:20,880
very brief introduction to my own work

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,359
to provide some context about how i

10
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,760
became interested in this field and also

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,960
the kinds of things that i tend to make

12
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,800
and given that it's a hacker camp i will

13
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,360
be focusing on a lot of practical tips

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,000
to help you prototype and experiment as

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,719
well as throwing in sprinkling in some

16
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,920
inspiring uh use cases from artistic and

17
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,760
industry um so i'm going to give you a

18
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,320
whistle stop tour of a few different

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,719
parts of soft electronics i'm going to

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,280
start off with electronic embroidery and

21
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:56,160
then i'm going to touch on e-textiles

22
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,399
before moving on to flexible circuits

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,800
soft robotics and then the concept of

24
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,120
softness in electronics so

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,799
that's what the next half an hour is

26
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,520
going to be full of i hope you enjoy it

27
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:09,680
so as i say let's start off with a

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,920
little introduction to myself so my day

29
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,240
job now i'm head of community at

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,479
crowdsupply which is a curated

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,320
crowdfunding platform for open source

32
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,799
hardware part of nasa electronics which

33
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:23,040
you may have heard of but before i moved

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,280
over to the us to do that job i spent

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,119
many years as a writer and a

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,280
professional maker i used to write about

37
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,439
hardware for make magazine and hackaday

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
and blah blah blah but i also

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,479
wrote a book called the crafty kids

40
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,400
guide to diy electronics which is a

41
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,400
children's book about electronics taught

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,640
three craft so and this was the first

43
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,040
time that i i mean i'd done sewable

44
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,240
electronics before and i'd done

45
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,840
electronic embroidery but this is the

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,479
first time that i really went deep um

47
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,479
during the research for this book

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,200
um and it made me notice the switch in

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
my audience so

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
i've done as i say i've done personal

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:01,360
from throughout my personal curiosity um

52
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,119
i'd experimented with snowball

53
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:05,759
electronics um but um

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,680
the teaching the basic concepts of

55
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,318
electronics through craft really

56
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:12,239
helped me hit a different audience it

57
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,160
suddenly became

58
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,040
90

59
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,040
little girls and 10

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,400
boys and i was like what is going on

61
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,160
here it's pretty interesting by putting

62
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,920
electronics in the context of craft it

63
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,400
really changed um the type of people

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,239
that were coming to my workshops so and

65
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
this is a talk at

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
a conference not an education conference

67
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,360
so i'm not going to go too deep into the

68
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,200
pedagogical details

69
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,000
but i will say that my experiences

70
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,840
running workshops teaching basic

71
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,200
electronics

72
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,280
with a standard through-hole learn to

73
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,760
solder kit versus a sewing circuits kit

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
was completely different it taught

75
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
largely the same skills you know simple

76
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,360
circuits parallel circuits yada yada um

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,200
but the medium completely changed the

78
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:55,120
demographics and the vibe so i thought

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,440
that was really interesting

80
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,280
um after the book was published um i

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,959
worked on another project here that

82
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,400
worked that put technology in the

83
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,319
context of craft and this is the mini

84
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,400
moo it's my hand on the box hand model

85
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
as well as an electronics weirdo

86
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,360
um it's a diy wearable instruments that

87
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,159
i designed for pimaroni and imogen heap

88
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:15,920
and kids

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,599
sew wire code and play this glove it's

90
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
really cute it's based on the mini moo

91
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,440
which is a expensive like two and a half

92
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,400
grand

93
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,000
midi controller um but uh but this is

94
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,840
this is like 40 dollars so a much

95
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,560
cheaper and really fun thing and again

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,959
it was it was a very appealing project

97
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,360
to teen and tween girls who were

98
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:40,000
experimenting with microcontrollers

99
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,519
um and actually

100
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,599
um the kids in the workshop who were

101
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:46,640
good at sewing and had a confidence

102
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,159
boost at the beginning of the lesson and

103
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,959
also they got onto the coding portion

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,879
and earlier than the people who were not

105
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,879
so good at sewing so it balanced like

106
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,319
the classroom a little bit that's quite

107
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,519
fun

108
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,280
moving on and the final strand of my

109
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,280
personal work that i wanted to introduce

110
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,680
you to is instrument making so when i

111
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,680
wasn't making things for other people i

112
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,280
tend to

113
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
make instruments or sound making devices

114
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,560
and i like to use experimental materials

115
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,280
in that work from soft electronics

116
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,358
electronic embroidery and so on but also

117
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,519
using architectural materials and kind

118
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,320
of sculptural materials so that's me in

119
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,000
a nutshell very quickly and hopefully

120
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,919
that will give you some contact context

121
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,080
for the rest of this talk i've been

122
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,160
using these technologies in my own work

123
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,240
for a number of years so

124
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,360
hopefully some of my learning my painful

125
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,280
learning will help you avoid the pain as

126
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
you start experimenting with any of

127
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,960
these techniques

128
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,960
so

129
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,360
when most people think about electronics

130
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,160
they think about wires and boxes and

131
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,120
stiff fiberglass printed circuit boards

132
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,520
now the wires in those boxes and the

133
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,440
traces on the circuit boards are all

134
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,720
just paths for electricity to move along

135
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,720
and by choosing a different type of

136
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,280
material to make these paths we can make

137
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,759
all sorts of unexpected and exciting

138
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,199
electronics

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,880
in this example we're looking at an

140
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,280
embroidery sampler with a very simple

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,240
circuit

142
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,720
you've got at the bottom you've got a 3v

143
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,000
coin cell

144
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,080
and then there's an led at the top

145
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,039
and

146
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:21,120
you can make the same circuit on a

147
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,520
breadboard on a printed circuit board or

148
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:26,000
just by soldering some wires together

149
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,639
but here the fiberglass that is over

150
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,479
there i'm pointing up here here the

151
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
fiberglass of the circuit board is

152
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,479
replaced by felt and the copper traces

153
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,639
are replaced by a curvy flowing stitches

154
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,360
in this case um based on i think a steel

155
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,560
thread

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
um i would say that these kind of

157
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,520
embroidery hoops are actually really

158
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,240
great for learning to sew um conductive

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,759
stuff because it keeps everything in one

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,720
place more on that in a moment okay

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,320
onwards

162
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,720
so conductive thread yes whole slide on

163
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,560
this so it's the starting point for most

164
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,960
people who want to experiment with soft

165
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,880
electronics so i'm going to spend you a

166
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:06,000
little time here guiding you through um

167
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,400
the basics of what exists and and what

168
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,560
you might like so my number one i've got

169
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,400
two favorites and i've tried pretty much

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,880
every conductive thread on the market um

171
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,759
but the the there's there's some there's

172
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,840
a few different genres of thread let's

173
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,160
take a look at some of these

174
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,199
so

175
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,680
these are just my own genres of thread

176
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,120
they're not like official technical

177
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,199
titles i will say that so this there's a

178
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,520
type of thread that's quite fluffy and

179
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,919
you might see um like strands coming off

180
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,240
of on it like something like this

181
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
and a fluffy type of thread now that

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,800
kind of thread knots really well

183
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,199
but because it's fluffy like this you

184
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
can see you've got all of these threads

185
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,360
coming off of the side and if you sew

186
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,759
things too close together it's like

187
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:52,000
short circuit city so like any single

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,680
one of those threads touches another bit

189
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
of a thread and your circuit isn't going

190
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,800
to work so a practical tip that i use

191
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
here is

192
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,280
after you've sewn things in place um

193
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,560
just spray it with a little bit of

194
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,639
hairspray and that will keep the hair

195
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,360
that will keep the flyaways in place

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,520
and so that's that one

197
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,960
and then there's another type of flood

198
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,919
that is

199
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,400
nowadays more common it's a waxy type of

200
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,280
thread um you will find that

201
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,360
sold by adafruit and

202
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,759
just generally out of there um it

203
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,800
doesn't

204
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,479
cause shirt circuits but the knots

205
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,400
really like to come undone so again a

206
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,240
little tip here that i've learned in my

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,840
years of experience is to just put a

208
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,080
little dab of either hot glue or clear

209
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
nail varnish on your knots after you've

210
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,000
made them to keep them from going out

211
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
and um

212
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,720
so they've got the fluffy you've got the

213
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,120
waxy and then you've got the um you've

214
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,280
got the metal base the metal ones that

215
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,680
are pure metal so there's this is mostly

216
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,440
made by a company a german company

217
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
called kalgrim

218
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
and absolutely beautiful threads you can

219
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,800
solder them all the other types of

220
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,120
threads you can't solder you can solder

221
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,680
the calgrain ones but it's very brittle

222
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,080
to work with very nice though

223
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
but then my number one favorite is a

224
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:07,919
thread called madeira um and they do

225
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,240
fantastic and you can use that so you

226
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,479
can use that in both top and bottom of a

227
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:14,879
sewing machine so um they're great you

228
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,960
can buy majira thread only from one

229
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,440
place in the uk and that's light

230
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,720
stitches

231
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,960
um but they're a german company again

232
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,639
and you can buy them on the internet as

233
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,039
well but if you yeah they're quite hard

234
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,360
to get hold of but yeah the

235
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,159
the um the madeira threads

236
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,120
are

237
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,159
um

238
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,839
developed by a professional embroidery

239
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
company which i will have a look at

240
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,640
later

241
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
um but yeah so those are my favorites

242
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:42,000
and those are the genres and my tips for

243
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,519
working with each of the genres of

244
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,760
thread but just make sure you take care

245
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,600
of uh take care of these things right

246
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,160
here we go let's move on okay two more

247
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,399
um very practical tips to give you and

248
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,560
which is um the things to watch out for

249
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:56,480
when you're starting off with sewing

250
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,120
your circuits are loose connections and

251
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
dangling knots so loose connections

252
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,279
means that you're likely to have an

253
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,440
incomplete circuit so wiggling your

254
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,120
component about maybe

255
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,120
it light slips sporadically then you've

256
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,200
probably got a loose connection

257
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,680
um but once you so you you should make

258
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,279
make your connections really nice and

259
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,519
tight and snug and three tight stitches

260
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,519
should do it quite nicely

261
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:20,800
and once you've got your components

262
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,800
stitched on nice and tight and you also

263
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,440
need to keep an eye out for knots and

264
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
loose ends which can dangle around and

265
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,080
make short circuits that's why you start

266
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,839
out on these embroidery hoops because

267
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,680
you can flip them over really nicely and

268
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,080
inspect the back i'd say nine times out

269
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,000
of ten when i've run embroidery

270
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,959
workshops um it's it's been loose

271
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,320
underneath um wires that cause the first

272
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,640
errors so yeah definitely watch out for

273
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,720
those two things

274
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,200
so those basic st tips that i just

275
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,720
shared should start you out on

276
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,800
embroidering electronics and i wanted to

277
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,959
bring this slide up here to take a look

278
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,360
at some more advanced techniques and

279
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,040
this is um this is an

280
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,880
an embroidered synthesizer that i made

281
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,279
last night last year which is actually a

282
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,680
riff on a noise maker called a crackle

283
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,560
box or crack doors if sorry dutch

284
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,079
hackers i find just mangled your

285
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,160
language um but there's a dutch artist

286
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,480
in the 60s that made

287
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,320
that made this called the michael vice

288
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
bits

289
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,399
um and this is my version of it um and

290
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:23,920
the three techniques on this project

291
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,519
that i um

292
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,360
that you might find useful

293
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,079
um are in the center you can see that

294
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,480
there's a chip on the board an eight leg

295
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,440
dip chip um and making through-hole

296
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,519
compo oh sorry yeah so by adding a chip

297
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,760
you can either solder individual legs

298
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,680
which historically was what most people

299
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,880
did

300
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,720
really difficult and if your chip burns

301
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,839
out um you've got to unpick everything

302
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:49,360
and it's a disaster

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,959
so i made um a series of flex pcbs with

304
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,000
castellated edges that i could solder

305
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,959
the dip chip socket into

306
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:02,320
and then sew the flex pcb

307
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,800
onto the embroidery service and that

308
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,959
means you can remove the chips those are

309
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,640
all on my github i think

310
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,040
um so that's that's that's a tip and i

311
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,560
don't see many i don't see anyone else

312
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,240
doing that so i wanted to like be like

313
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,760
you should do this you should totally do

314
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:18,640
this

315
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,240
um and then the other thing i wanted to

316
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
say is pretty much any through-hole

317
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,959
component can become a sewable component

318
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:25,920
um and

319
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,320
the way that you use it is the way you

320
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,880
do that is with a pair of needle nose

321
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,600
pliers and you just basically twist the

322
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,440
component round and round the needle

323
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,079
nose pliers until it forms a loop smush

324
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,160
it down a little bit and then just sew

325
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,959
on you can see there i've done that with

326
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,800
the two capacitors so you just make a

327
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,040
little loop to sew it onto a thing that

328
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
works for leds that works for light

329
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,440
sensors you can do you can put quite a

330
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,320
lot of through-hole components onto

331
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,639
onto a piece of embroidery and with very

332
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:59,279
little effort just a just a pair of

333
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,600
needle nose pliers

334
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,839
so okay and this is a really example

335
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,440
this is an amazing example this is not

336
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,519
my work i am not this good this is an

337
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,920
example of really advanced electronic

338
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,320
embroidery from an artist called irene

339
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,560
posh and this is actually a fully

340
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,160
functional programmable 8-bit computer

341
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,519
made with gold embroidery and magnets so

342
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,240
this actually works it flips over look

343
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,440
her up on the internet she's got loads

344
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,959
of really interesting pieces of work

345
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,720
yeah that's irene posh and the

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,320
embroidered computer very cool project

347
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,279
okay

348
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,519
um so the field of electronic embroidery

349
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,200
is like

350
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,760
maturing at a rapid pace at the moment

351
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:41,440
it used to be a bit more of a niche

352
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,079
technology mostly practiced by diyers

353
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,680
like me artists academics and so on but

354
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
nowadays there are new materials new

355
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,160
machines and new processes bringing them

356
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,079
into industry

357
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,000
i spent two weeks with the folks at

358
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,680
microsoft research just before the

359
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,760
pandemic hit and i was lucky enough to

360
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,720
see one of these bad boys in action this

361
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,639
is a zsk industrial embroidery machine

362
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,959
loaded up with madeira thread which if

363
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,639
you're paying attention earlier is my

364
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:12,320
favorite type of thread

365
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
so here you see and

366
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,160
normally i would play a video for this

367
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,320
but um it didn't it doesn't really work

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
so basically

369
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:21,440
it's incredibly fast this is an

370
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,000
industrial machine that is picking and

371
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,639
placing and like creating these um

372
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,959
threads that are capacitive touch and

373
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,040
the the microcontroller you can see in

374
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,040
the middle there is the adafruit circuit

375
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,360
playground express and yes the embroi

376
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,440
the embroidery machine did embroider

377
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,399
that in place as well automatically it's

378
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,120
like

379
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,760
this does not convey the speed of this

380
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,760
thing it's an industrial machine so when

381
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,120
it's up and running it sounds like a

382
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:48,399
machine gun

383
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,120
and it's done in seconds it's incredible

384
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,079
and it was the first time i've seen a

385
00:13:53,079 --> 00:13:56,079
microcontroller being placed on an

386
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:57,760
industrial embroidery machine so it's

387
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,000
very exciting still fairly experimental

388
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,480
but it's really coming into it

389
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,440
um

390
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
so these are another thing from the

391
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,800
industrial these are um pick and place

392
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,560
sequins um basically in order to create

393
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:12,880
more advanced e-tec styles you need to

394
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:15,199
have a way to industrialize them and

395
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
that includes a way of mass you know

396
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,720
you've got to have these mass produced

397
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,560
so you can't hand sew on all of these

398
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,320
things so lots of lots of development at

399
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,680
the moment is going into creating

400
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,839
components that can be used in the

401
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,480
embroidery industries version of a pick

402
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,839
and place machine

403
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,279
is very cool

404
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,040
and one more example of industrial

405
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,959
electronic embroidery with this is

406
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:38,399
really cool so this is actually this is

407
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,079
not experimental this is actually in use

408
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:41,920
at the moment and this is what we call

409
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,839
moss embroidery which is a chenille

410
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:47,360
fabric technique that you might see on

411
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,760
towels and carpets and so on and and

412
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,480
tests of the thread are pushed through a

413
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,760
substrate and they create this like

414
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,160
mossy loop kind of effect

415
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,120
and this is used in medicine a lot now

416
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,760
um as electrodes instead especially for

417
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,760
people with sensitivities to adhesives

418
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,240
or babies these are sewn into stretchy

419
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
garments that are then placed on the

420
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,680
body to to sense various things instead

421
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,839
of having like metal electrodes it's

422
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,480
soft it's it's not allergenic and it's

423
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,680
actually um it's it's um it's really

424
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,959
great for all sorts of things and not

425
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,279
only it not only um an input it doesn't

426
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,760
only sense things this actually is used

427
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,920
as an output for electro stimulation

428
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,839
therapy of muscles and so on so yeah

429
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,680
this is actually in use today so that's

430
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
really cool

431
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,279
moving on briefly to

432
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,880
e-textiles

433
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:38,480
it's used very generically it's not

434
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,480
super useful anymore the word e-type

435
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,880
styles but i'm using it here to refer to

436
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,320
conductive materials that have

437
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,639
cloth-like properties

438
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:47,440
um

439
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,320
so

440
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,120
there's two different types of fabric

441
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,680
there's woven versus knit

442
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,279
and the difference between that is the

443
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,440
yarn or the thread that composes them so

444
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,759
a knit fabric is made up of one yarn

445
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,839
looped around continuously

446
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,079
and a woven fabric is made of

447
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,720
intersecting yarns crossing each other

448
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,040
at right angles to the grain

449
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,160
um

450
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,959
so knit conductive fabric has different

451
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,440
resistance in each direction as a result

452
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
and but the woven fabric is the same on

453
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
each side because it's the thing and

454
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,600
these both of these fabrics are

455
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,279
available from adafruit if you want to

456
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,720
have a go on them

457
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,320
another great material you might want to

458
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,720
have an experiment with is velostat

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,759
velostax is pressure sensitive fabric

460
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,399
it's much much cheaper to use

461
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,440
than pressure sensitive sensors and you

462
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,600
can cut it out and you can make flexible

463
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,759
sensors with it i made meowing yoga

464
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:44,240
pants with my with my friend phoenix

465
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,959
once using velostat definitely if you're

466
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:48,800
interested it's a great material to have

467
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:51,759
on your radar and pretty cheap as well

468
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:53,600
i also wanted to give a shout out to

469
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,560
various types of tapes and this is my

470
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:58,480
neighbor when i used to live in berlin i

471
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,959
made um made them made her a cape

472
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,000
um but here this is using so copper tape

473
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,039
is everywhere um and you can you can you

474
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,720
can use like just ordinary slug tape

475
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,880
from hardware that's fine for putting it

476
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,679
on fabric but actually i much prefer a

477
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,679
fabric conductive tape which is made of

478
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:18,720
nylon and you can get them from adafruit

479
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
or you it's also called maker tape and

480
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,640
you can get that from brain dog gadgets

481
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,679
and that's what i've used in this

482
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:27,359
project and it's a really nice um

483
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,960
it's really nice to use on fabric and

484
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,320
it's very very quick and dirty it's

485
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,480
great for prototyping

486
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,000
um another axe i know um another um tape

487
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:37,360
i wanted to give a shout out to is

488
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,400
z-axis tape which is what cbtronics uses

489
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:42,640
and that's only conductive on the z-axis

490
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,080
so it's really fun for sticker type

491
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:45,039
stuff

492
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:46,720
i also have an honourable melting i

493
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,640
don't do felting but i know people do

494
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,720
and you can get conductive felting stuff

495
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,400
so if you like stabbing things with

496
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,640
needles to make them into shapes there

497
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,240
are conductive materials available for

498
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
you to do that

499
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,760
and i also wanted to give a shout out to

500
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,720
crochet another a dark art as far as i'm

501
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,919
concerned um but and this is a piece of

502
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,280
work um done by and dr anarato already

503
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,600
and she does lots and lots of crochet

504
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,840
um and she argues that yarn is harder

505
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,120
and she's done lots and lots of really

506
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,480
interesting electronics crochet projects

507
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,559
and i she did a talk at the open

508
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:22,480
hardware summit this year called knotty

509
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,080
hardware that i would highly recommend

510
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
you check out as well

511
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,880
um one of the most essential things for

512
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
people to be aware of when they're going

513
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,000
into

514
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,880
um electronical electronics is you must

515
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,559
know about the bible of snowball

516
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:38,480
electronics which is the kobe kant

517
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,600
website

518
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,160
um this is one of their pieces they make

519
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,960
extremely high-end

520
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,960
beautiful this is this is the morning

521
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,640
dress that they made and it's a wailing

522
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,720
speaker those are hand sewn speakers

523
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,559
that work on that dress it's an

524
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,960
exquisite piece of work and but the the

525
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,960
website that you put that i put there

526
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
it's called how to get what you want and

527
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,320
it is filled with ideas and workshops

528
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,840
and projects that they've done and

529
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,440
really well documented so you should

530
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,000
really be aware of that

531
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,160
okay moving on very briefly to flexible

532
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,600
circuit boards so

533
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,679
the substrate of a normal circuit board

534
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:15,120
is made of fiberglass which is a very

535
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:18,000
stiff material in a flexible circuit

536
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,120
board um the material substrate is made

537
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,679
out of is called captain and it's laser

538
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,520
cut instead of rooted which means you

539
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,039
can make some much more interesting

540
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,600
shapes now flex is not new it's been

541
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,520
used in industry for a very long time

542
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,760
but it's only made its way into the

543
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,559
maker diy world recently because osh

544
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,600
park this um us circuit board service

545
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,760
and made it available very cheaply and

546
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,440
i've been experimenting with it so this

547
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,760
photograph i put it up here it's it's by

548
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,799
this guy called carl jager and he's got

549
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:51,039
he does loads of flex experiments on

550
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,760
youtube so if you are interested in flex

551
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,960
definitely check out his youtube channel

552
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,799
i can't do all this so some of the

553
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,799
practical use reasons to use flex are

554
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,960
obviously it flexes

555
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,679
hello and it's also very thin and you

556
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:07,679
can and it's also laser cuttable so you

557
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,760
can make really intricate shapes

558
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,120
and there are a lot of design

559
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,760
considerations for flex for example like

560
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,840
the minimum bend radiance you've got to

561
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,520
you've got to use teardrop shapes on

562
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,600
your vias and pads um

563
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,480
but

564
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,000
it's actually surprisingly easy to

565
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,080
experiment with especially if you go via

566
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,440
ash park because there's they've got

567
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,840
like um the design rules up there so

568
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,600
would highly recommend and that's

569
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,840
essential watch which is great

570
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
and that's my project that used vocoder

571
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,960
let's move on okay soft robotics um is

572
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,000
um

573
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,799
so this is if you've been out into into

574
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,559
the if you might have seen these people

575
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,400
this is the the same people that did the

576
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,679
tentacles um and the reef and their ayah

577
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:49,679
giants and they make huge emotionally

578
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,760
expressive robots robotic creatures and

579
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,360
spaces like really really cool stuff and

580
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,039
they're here so you should definitely

581
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,880
definitely go and check those out while

582
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,080
you're here

583
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,960
so conventional robots are typically

584
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
made from rigid parts which makes them

585
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
vulnerable to harm from bumps and

586
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,159
scrapes and so on and these these parts

587
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,760
also make them fairly immobile they

588
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,679
can't squeeze past things they are their

589
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,520
shape they do what they do

590
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,640
but soft robots um are being made out of

591
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,960
elastic and rubber and all these things

592
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,200
and a lot of the designs are inspired by

593
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,679
octopuses and starfish and worms and so

594
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:26,480
on and this is an octopus spot which is

595
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
a squishy underwater robot with eight

596
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,799
limbs that bend in every direction and

597
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:33,520
it's got a pneumatic control core it's

598
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:35,840
very cool so it expands the mantle with

599
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,679
water jets like the fluid to shoot

600
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:40,080
forward and then the floppy arms stiffen

601
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,320
and turn to crawl over things and then

602
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,320
it can squish in between rocks to get

603
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,480
places so this kind of technology and

604
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,799
soft robotics is a really exciting field

605
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:51,280
full of lots of challenges for different

606
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,440
spaces it's very cool

607
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,120
and if you want to get started out with

608
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,440
it um there are a few things starting to

609
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,720
come onto the market that are suitable

610
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,200
for diyers this is programmable air

611
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,360
which is an arduino-based pneumatics

612
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,600
platform um by

613
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,159
uh by tinkermind there on on twitter and

614
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,840
so if you're interested in experimenting

615
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,640
do check that out then finally we're

616
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,559
talking briefly about the concept of

617
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,480
software in electronics so this is my

618
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,840
tentacle project i've actually

619
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,679
resurrected it i'll take it to the pub

620
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,679
afterwards so you can play with it

621
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,280
i made this when i was really depressed

622
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,720
and i wanted something

623
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:27,120
soft and loving and comforting to wrap

624
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
around me and like you know do something

625
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,880
comforting which was purring um and i've

626
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,840
just really enjoyed um

627
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,679
wait hang on with my slides gone oh no

628
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,960
we're not watching that i haven't got

629
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,720
time for that

630
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,480
i haven't got time for that

631
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,360
yeah here we are so so this might the

632
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,960
softness i wanted something something to

633
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,039
wrap around me and by putting the

634
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
electronics inside

635
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,760
of something soft it completely changed

636
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:56,240
the feeling of of that piece of

637
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,280
electronics i think material choice can

638
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,880
really change a project so this is um a

639
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:04,960
leather glove i've actually got this

640
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
with me as well it's like an

641
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,919
elbow-length glove

642
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:09,919
and it's exactly the same code as the

643
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,919
children's glove from earlier

644
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,159
but the material choice

645
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,480
felt for children and then this like

646
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,320
amazing black leather for me it

647
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,919
completely changed the vibe of the

648
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:23,679
material so that's a that's consider

649
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,520
your material choices and consider what

650
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,520
they will do to the people who are

651
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,360
interacting with your electronics you

652
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,880
can do some really really interesting

653
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,559
things

654
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:35,039
okay um and then i've got a bonus slide

655
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:36,960
yes i've got three minutes left i got my

656
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,600
bonus slide amazing so i haven't even

657
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,279
touched on the cool microcontrollers and

658
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,880
single board computers that you might

659
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,799
use with these kinds of things but here

660
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,960
are my favorites if you're just getting

661
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:49,039
started i would highly recommend either

662
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,679
the adafruit circuit playground express

663
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,640
or the micro bit both of them come with

664
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
really nice large pin pads so even

665
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,240
little kids can sew through them

666
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,159
um if you're moving on if you're already

667
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:03,760
familiar with micro controllers and

668
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,320
single board computers my two favorites

669
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:07,200
are

670
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,720
i'm such a fan girl for bella um balor

671
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,279
and balor and beagleboard are a really

672
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,960
great combination

673
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,279
for really amazing embedded

674
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,039
low latency stuff

675
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,720
and in fact somebody from bella is

676
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,159
actually here this weekend i think

677
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:24,080
they're doing becky stewart's doing a

678
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:26,320
workshop on sunday um which i'm hoping

679
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,919
to go to as well

680
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:29,600
really like i love bella for for that

681
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:32,240
kind of stuff another big person i

682
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:34,159
really like are the solder party boards

683
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:35,840
and they're done by the swedish guy

684
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,919
called arturo and he's got a lot of

685
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:39,919
really interesting um

686
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,159
boards that use castellated edges which

687
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:43,760
are normally used for prototyping and

688
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:47,200
breadboards um but for me it's a great

689
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,520
hook to to

690
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,760
secure my stitches in place so you put

691
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,600
the stitch through one

692
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,440
and then the cascellated edge basically

693
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,960
hooks it on so it's really nice and

694
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,039
secure i love a capsulated edge board

695
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:00,640
for sewing

696
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,720
and then finally um two shout outs to

697
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,279
people who are actually doing made

698
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,799
boards for

699
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,679
made for these kind of things one is the

700
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:12,320
make fashion people up in up in canada

701
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:13,440
and they're doing they've actually got

702
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,799
some new boards coming out which have

703
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,799
got some fascinating stretchy platted

704
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,120
cables very exciting about those lots of

705
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,480
led's for their stuff so if you're

706
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,480
interested in integrating leds into your

707
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,200
work and check those people out and also

708
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,760
a big shout out and a big thank you to

709
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,440
the original um made for sewables

710
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,480
um range which was arduino i mean we is

711
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,480
an arduino series of boards by leah

712
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,039
buckley from mit and she did the lily

713
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:41,120
pad series which is open source hardware

714
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,200
as well as on many in fact

715
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,159
uh

716
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:46,000
everything but apart from the micro bit

717
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,600
that i've listed here is open source

718
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,200
hardware i don't know about make fashion

719
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,880
who knows but many of them are open

720
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,799
source hardware so if you're interested

721
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,480
in actually creating some of your own

722
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,960
stuff for this you can just go along and

723
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,440
take a look at what they've done so

724
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,840
i've got 20 i think that's it i've done

725
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
half an hour this is

726
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
this was like an hour-long talk so i've

727
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,320
kind of had to compress it a lot but i

728
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,559
hope that i've given you a whistle stop

729
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,880
tour of some of the fun stuff that can

730
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,640
come with soft electronics with some

731
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
practical tips and uh yeah that's me um

732
