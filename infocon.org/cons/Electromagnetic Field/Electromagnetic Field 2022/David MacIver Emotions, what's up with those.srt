1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
[Applause]

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:09,920
hi so thanks for coming everyone uh i am

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,599
indeed going to be talking to you about

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,559
emotions and what's up with those

5
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,160
which is something that no one ever told

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,720
me until i had to figure a lot of it

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,880
out and so hopefully i can save some of

8
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,080
you the pain

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,600
um

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,199
i thought i would just start writing

11
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,519
with a worked example um worked example

12
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
i'm surrounded by spiders for some

13
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:30,400
reason

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,079
just obviously provoking some strong

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:33,760
emotions uh no this isn't my actual

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,360
worked example but um they weren't

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:36,960
kidding about the spiders

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,840
um

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,360
which is

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,640
um let's talk yourself i was

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,559
procrastinating on writing this talk

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,239
i'm like one or each of you might have

23
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,600
experienced a procrastination i know

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,640
this is like a rare experience but uh

25
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,520
um

26
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:50,640
but

27
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
i think most people who procrastinate

28
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
like they have the wrong idea about

29
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,239
uh procrastination how it works like

30
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,079
procrastination isn't something you're

31
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,719
doing because like you're lazy it's not

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,680
some weird mysterious thing going on uh

33
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:05,040
that where you're just like

34
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,400
self-sabotaging for no good reason

35
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,680
procrastination is mostly just like you

36
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,280
don't want to do the thing

37
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,520
on some level and that was very much my

38
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
my experience here like once i i pinned

39
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,720
this down i was um like i had original

40
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,880
plan for this talk and

41
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:20,400
like i was procrastinating because on

42
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,920
something i was like this is a bad plan

43
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,119
david you don't want to give this talk

44
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:24,479
this way like what's wrong like

45
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,960
something's wrong here and

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,320
um

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,720
i despite my claims to be emotionally

48
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,159
aware it did take me a couple of weeks

49
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,000
to finally pin down what this was so i'm

50
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,920
talking through this like there's a

51
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,600
there's a strong fear i wasn't qualified

52
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,680
for this talk like ever like um i'm just

53
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
some guy this is my this isn't my

54
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,439
background like i'm a computer scientist

55
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,520
i am or a software developer i didn't

56
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,479
even finish my computer science phd um

57
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,439
but

58
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,320
um

59
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,119
like

60
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,720
um there's definitely some part to me

61
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,880
going like no don't get this talk no

62
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,360
it's not not your not your field um and

63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,719
this is like a reasonable concern right

64
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
like there are definitely talks which if

65
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
i was going to come up and give you a

66
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
talk about cell biology i really hope i

67
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,600
would be having like this feeling of i'm

68
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,960
not qualified to give this talk because

69
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,318
i don't know a thing about cell biology

70
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,800
i lasted biology and gcses

71
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,280
um but i am actually qualified to give

72
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,080
this talk like i'm not um like i have

73
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:18,160
been working on this on my own and with

74
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,599
other people for

75
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,760
um like most of five years now i've

76
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,080
written about us extensively um i'm not

77
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,680
telling you this to like show up my

78
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,879
credentials like i'm just saying that

79
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,959
this feeling that i'm not qualified to

80
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,080
give this talk it's pointing at

81
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
something but it's not pointing at like

82
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,879
i actually can't give this talk

83
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,040
there is a problem by the way um which

84
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,319
is that they're

85
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,640
this

86
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,560
i am qualified to give this talk

87
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,319
insofar as anyone is qualified to give

88
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,080
this talk and also nobody is qualified

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
to give this talk if it was the type of

90
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,319
talk i was conceiving of because

91
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:56,239
um

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,560
there's a way of engaging with all of

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,159
this material like from the therapy

94
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,440
literature from the psychology

95
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:03,840
literature which is that basically if

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,599
you read it and you believe what they

97
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:06,879
are saying

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,200
uh you're gonna go wrong because

99
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,120
everyone is talking really confidently

100
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,280
about how emotions work about here this

101
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,560
is like the one theory that fits

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,519
everything

103
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,480
and

104
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,239
um it work and they tend to work really

105
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,000
well for

106
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,440
the subset of people they work really

107
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,599
well for and really badly for

108
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,200
um

109
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,159
some of the people they didn't work

110
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,080
really well for um which sounds

111
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,920
tautological but i mean like there are

112
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
people in both groups and i've known a

113
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,959
lot of people

114
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,840
sort of

115
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,040
in the course of trying to learn about

116
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,360
all this who have basically been messed

117
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:38,959
up because they've gone too all in on

118
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,799
some particular theory that wasn't

119
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:42,720
working well for them

120
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,070
um

121
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:44,319
[Music]

122
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,760
and so at this point i've got like

123
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,280
this starts to be like okay i'm no

124
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,040
longer procrastinating for a mysterious

125
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
reason i'm procrastinating for a very

126
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,400
good reason that

127
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:56,640
i'm about to do now that i was going to

128
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,640
do a bad plan

129
00:03:58,640 --> 00:03:59,680
um

130
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,519
so there's a very simple answer to the

131
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:02,799
question like what did they take me too

132
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:04,720
seriously let's make sure you don't

133
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,400
hardly by giving a worked example about

134
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,959
um how bad i am giving this talk but

135
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,120
more importantly i want to sort of

136
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,519
go in like giving you some

137
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:15,360
guidelines on how seriously to take this

138
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,478
talk

139
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:17,839
i'm pretty sure almost all the things

140
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:19,199
i'm gonna be saying to you are useful

141
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,639
like this has helped me this has helped

142
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,000
other people i know

143
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,440
um i

144
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,919
i'm i'm not going to just be spouting a

145
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,360
bunch of nonsense that you can't know

146
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,600
that won't help at all

147
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,040
some of the things i say might even be

148
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,840
true um it's uh

149
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
i think like

150
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,199
most of what i'm saying is going to be

151
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,360
approximately true

152
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,639
and

153
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,000
it certainly isn't stuff i've made up

154
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,199
like it's based on a whole bunch of

155
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,040
different and reading and practice and

156
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,360
so on um but

157
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:49,440
it's definitely not completely right and

158
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,120
i can't necessarily tell you which bits

159
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,960
are and aren't right uh this is just how

160
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,280
i currently understand it

161
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,120
it is how i currently understand it

162
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,720
again like based on all sorts of other

163
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,880
work but this is the

164
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,560
sort of the bits i've synthesized

165
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,400
together that work well for me and

166
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
people like me so

167
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,880
um like if you two are a highly

168
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,639
analytical nerd who likes thinking about

169
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,320
things too much i think we might have

170
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,639
one or two of us here um

171
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,600
then

172
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,120
this should probably be more useful to

173
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
you than a lot of like the therapy

174
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,960
literature if you are

175
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,160
very if you think about things very

176
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,720
differently you might want to like try a

177
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,240
different approach

178
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,440
um

179
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,280
this is mostly stuff i wish someone had

180
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,479
told me much earlier than they did

181
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:33,520
unfortunately it's going to be very high

182
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,800
level overview because i only have half

183
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,240
an hour and so i can't like take you

184
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
through a detailed therapeutic

185
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,039
breakthrough in which you like get to

186
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,560
the bottom of any emotional problems you

187
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,000
may have but like it's sort of i'm

188
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
trying to point to

189
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,720
in the direction of like where i

190
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,280
think healthy emotional processing lives

191
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,440
and like give you some guidelines on how

192
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,120
to get there

193
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,160
um

194
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,319
but yeah i actually you do actually have

195
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,759
to do the work if you want to use any of

196
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,960
this like you're not going to come out

197
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,759
of this suddenly like going man emotion

198
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:04,000
stakes it makes sense now

199
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
um

200
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,560
yeah so this is stuff i figured out in

201
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
the last five years or so i got to my

202
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,080
mid-30s and went and

203
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,759
started a phd

204
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:12,880
and

205
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,039
was as traditional on a phd in miserable

206
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,880
um and

207
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:17,840
went

208
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,560
and decided to fix this um

209
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,400
sorry i'm speeding through this slide a

210
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,080
bit more to get to the interesting bits

211
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,199
but um the

212
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,680
um i did also go to therapy uh

213
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,199
for me personally the books were useful

214
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,880
if you find a great therapist then the

215
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,880
therapist will probably probably be more

216
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,039
useful but this is the path i took

217
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:39,680
um things got better um partly because i

218
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,160
quit my phd um it's uh

219
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,360
one of the

220
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,440
advantages of being emotionally more

221
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,880
emotionally aware is that you can tell

222
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:48,720
when what you're doing is a bad idea and

223
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,360
i turned out the phd wasn't for me

224
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:53,039
um and now it's now and i'm going to

225
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,599
tell you about um what i did

226
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:57,120
okay so return to the question like

227
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,880
motion's what's something what's up with

228
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,800
this i'm now just going to tell you

229
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
what's up with this um

230
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,639
so the first thing is like emotions um

231
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,240
they are fundamental they start with

232
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,639
labeling behaviors like um

233
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,080
the reason there is an emotion called

234
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,319
anger is not because you can feel angry

235
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,800
it's because you can behave angrily

236
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,120
it's it's not that you can't feel anger

237
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,599
but the description starts when it

238
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,919
starts with the externally visible

239
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:26,318
behavior

240
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,160
when you feel when you're feeling an

241
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,960
emotion um that is basically saying you

242
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:32,960
want to behave that way in some on some

243
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,520
level um like it may

244
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
not in the sense that you totally

245
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,639
endorse feeling like that feeling that

246
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:39,440
way

247
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,240
but

248
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,479
uh some part of you is going anger anger

249
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,560
would be good now or fear fear would be

250
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,160
good now like this and this is like the

251
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,080
procrastination it wasn't that i didn't

252
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,680
want to write the talk but some part of

253
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,919
me didn't want to write the talk

254
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,120
um

255
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,000
this is because i think it's a good idea

256
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,160
i think one of the easy traps to fall

257
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,879
into is basically going emotions are

258
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:02,240
irrational things that are happening for

259
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,919
no good reason that's not true like

260
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,120
almost all the time when you're

261
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,440
experiencing some strong emotion it's

262
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,400
because

263
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,000
like some part of you is like this is a

264
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,080
good idea like this is this is the thing

265
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,160
that i need to do right now in order to

266
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,000
get what i need

267
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,639
um that doesn't mean it's right uh like

268
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,759
sometimes

269
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,960
an emotion is telling you something

270
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,280
useful and important and true and

271
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,280
sometimes it's just a bit confused like

272
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
your emotions are you and um

273
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,479
if any of you are infallible like please

274
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:31,520
come talk to me afterwards because i'd

275
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,559
love to know how you did but i'm

276
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,080
certainly not

277
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,679
um

278
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
when it's wrong and this is like one of

279
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,120
the important bits it's like you can

280
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,320
change this you can um

281
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,919
basically go oh right this is the

282
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,600
emotion i'm feeling right now i don't

283
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,040
need to be feeling an emotion i can feel

284
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
another emotion um

285
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,880
and when it's right you can like improve

286
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,240
on your behavior you don't have to

287
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,519
ignore the emotion you can and you can

288
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,120
um go

289
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:00,399
you can basically go oh right that's

290
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,399
useful information i will act on it um

291
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,880
like i didn't fix my problems with

292
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:06,480
procrastination on the talk by basically

293
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,720
like making the emotion go away i fix my

294
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,920
problems with procrastination on the

295
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
talk by going ah this emotion is telling

296
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,440
me useful information let me do

297
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,000
something about that

298
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,200
um

299
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,440
here's another worked example um in for

300
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,680
the other category problem um again this

301
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,000
one might be slightly relatable uh which

302
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,240
is help i'm at a festival

303
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:28,080
full of lots of cool people i don't know

304
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,040
any of you

305
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,480
um

306
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,360
and

307
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,200
um i should say this isn't the current

308
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
one for me this one i think this one is

309
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,640
something that i more or less fixed a

310
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,040
couple of years ago but um it's still

311
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,480
useful to go through

312
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
um

313
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,519
uh you would presumably like to talk to

314
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,800
people at the school festival like we're

315
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,160
all here to socialize um but uh many of

316
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,120
them you don't know that would be awful

317
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:50,640
like can you imagine just going up to

318
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
someone and saying hi this is hey i'm

319
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,600
david like

320
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
um uh the worst right

321
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,399
and well like why why is it awful um and

322
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,560
the

323
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,560
um

324
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,079
this is the sort of like the core

325
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,040
concern i find i or i found is that like

326
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,240
you're going to go up to someone you're

327
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,360
going to make it weird you're going to

328
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,680
be like fumble you're going to

329
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,560
um

330
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,480
you in some way uh screw up and

331
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,720
um

332
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,399
but like why is that bad like people

333
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:25,120
make people make mistakes um

334
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,160
and

335
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,680
um

336
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,680
and it's not yet necessarily the end of

337
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:31,279
the world i know it sometimes feels that

338
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:33,040
way but it isn't i promise

339
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
um but for me like it feels like oh no

340
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,560
everyone's going to laugh at me

341
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,839
everyone's going to like know i'm one of

342
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,360
the weird kids everyone's getting

343
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,240
there's going to be all sorts of social

344
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,720
consequences for this

345
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,000
um

346
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,200
i don't know if you've noticed but this

347
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,040
isn't so this isn't a school like we're

348
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,519
we're we're not a bunch of uh we're kids

349
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,040
we're not most of us we're not going to

350
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,360
see anyone here again unless we really

351
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
want to the social dynamics are totally

352
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,720
different

353
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
um this is very much like a for me for

354
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,640
me a a school reaction it is a

355
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,320
like i'm going to be seeing this person

356
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,240
every day for the next four years and

357
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,279
they're going to laugh at me with all

358
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,040
their friends and so on

359
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:10,240
um

360
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,360
but that's not where we are we're um

361
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,880
like we're all the weird kids here

362
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,040
everyone's fine um

363
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,560
like

364
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,920
things are basically going to be fine

365
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,839
there will be almost no major social

366
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,839
repercussions for screwing this up even

367
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:24,959
when we do

368
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,000
um

369
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,600
and

370
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
so maybe this isn't so bad maybe you can

371
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,360
just go up and talk to people and like

372
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,600
that's basically okay

373
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:35,680
uh

374
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,680
and

375
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,519
for me the going through this sort of

376
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,040
thought process genuinely does change

377
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,399
the emotional response like it doesn't

378
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,920
suddenly make the emotion go away i

379
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,839
don't suddenly go yes being awkward that

380
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:50,160
sounds great i love being awkward um but

381
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,320
the sting of it does lessen and every

382
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
time you do this the um it does get

383
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
better and for me personally like it's

384
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,000
embarrassing how often this isn't to

385
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,079
school is the key emotional revelation

386
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:06,000
revelation i need um because we um and i

387
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,680
apologize to anyone here who is still in

388
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
school because i know there are some

389
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,680
children in the audience so

390
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,120
for for you

391
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,000
school situations are the learn to do it

392
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,560
better rather than they learn to not be

393
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,720
to recognize the emotional difference

394
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,079
um

395
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,760
but for me like

396
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,519
a lot of your patterns of emotional

397
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,000
reaction are laid down in childhood um

398
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,480
if when sort of therapists talk about

399
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,639
like small t trauma like what they

400
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,519
generally actually mean is this is a

401
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,200
emotional pattern that you have learned

402
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,720
when you were younger and no longer

403
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:40,240
applies to your current situation it's

404
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,240
like it's a bad emotional lesson

405
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,920
um and

406
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
for some people those come from families

407
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:46,880
for some people just come from school

408
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,120
i'm a school person my family was great

409
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,800
um

410
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,959
but school not so much

411
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,079
and

412
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,760
like

413
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,600
recognizing that this is the sort of

414
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,360
shape of the reaction emotional reaction

415
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:01,279
you're having and

416
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,040
noticing the ways in which your current

417
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,200
environment is different from where that

418
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,720
reaction was learned

419
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,600
uh

420
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,360
really sort of starts to

421
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
shift your emotions in like a more like

422
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:15,839
situationally appropriate direction

423
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:16,300
um

424
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,519
[Music]

425
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,200
i'm just going to go through like the

426
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,160
points of the theory in detail now um

427
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,040
and

428
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,160
um

429
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,760
i think the first one is just like

430
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,079
emotions label behavior this is i think

431
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:28,880
the

432
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,720
more counter and most counter-intuitive

433
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,399
part of my claims because like everyone

434
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,480
is very much used to thinking of

435
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,399
emotions as very sort of internal things

436
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,000
um like the emotions are what you're

437
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,480
feeling not what you're doing and

438
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,000
um

439
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,560
it's worth sort of laboring no

440
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
elaborating like why this is

441
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,440
backwards in terms of where emotions

442
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,760
come from as a concept

443
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:55,920
uh the basic answer is like you can tell

444
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,360
that emotions are an external thing

445
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,480
because there are a lot of words for

446
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,240
them um

447
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,240
when we have lots of words for things

448
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:05,040
it's because you can point to them um if

449
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,199
you think about trying to experi explain

450
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,920
pain to someone um it's incredibly hard

451
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:11,839
to explain you're in like the current

452
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:14,000
pain you're experiencing because pain is

453
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,120
not a shared reference like um i can't

454
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,199
say it's like it's like this and then

455
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,720
statement or whatever like that's

456
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,440
considered antisocial so um

457
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,320
uh

458
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,399
so you end up with sort of very fuzzy

459
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,040
references and similarly like flavors

460
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,839
are much harder to describe than

461
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:32,800
um

462
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,519
things you can look at because um like

463
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,279
with a thing you can look at you can

464
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:38,639
just point you can say look it's the

465
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,639
thing i'm pointing at with the flavor

466
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
like what you're currently tasting you

467
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,160
can maybe share you can show the food

468
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
but um it's

469
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,839
um it's harder and so the more insurer

470
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,320
in the shared world things are the more

471
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
we have words for them and we have a lot

472
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:56,839
of words for emotions

473
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,120
um and

474
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
also i guess descriptions are clearly

475
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,560
made up like um it's this it's not to

476
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:05,440
say that emotions aren't real things but

477
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,800
um

478
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,920
i think

479
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,519
where the boundaries of an emotion are

480
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,360
like emotions blur into each other like

481
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,600
they're just descriptive words for

482
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,920
general patterns of things uh the

483
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,519
metaphor i usually like to use is that

484
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,519
emotions are like colors and like

485
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:23,360
anger irritation uh annoyance are no

486
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:26,480
more real things than like red fuchsia

487
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,240
magenta like they

488
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,440
um

489
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,759
they are descriptive

490
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:33,600
uh words for

491
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,839
observed things but

492
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:38,880
they just um

493
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,800
they just they're just sort of described

494
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,279
broad regions of the ends of space oops

495
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,279
i thought i have a more point there um

496
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,240
and so

497
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
like

498
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,199
often i think what people get hung up on

499
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:52,240
when trying to describe emotions is um

500
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,800
like am i feeling angry am i feeling

501
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,880
grumpy am i feeling like one of these

502
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,320
different fine grand words and like

503
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,079
often the question is about as useful as

504
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,160
a hot dog a sandwich um

505
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,320
it's um like

506
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,440
the

507
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,880
thing you are trying to understand when

508
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,320
you try to understand your emotions is

509
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,399
your behavior and emotional words are

510
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,560
useful labels that all but not

511
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,480
necessarily like very clear-cut

512
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
distinctions

513
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:18,820
um

514
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,000
[Music]

515
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,800
and

516
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,320
obviously like there is an internal

517
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:23,920
counterpart to emotions this isn't a

518
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,399
pure behavioral theory like um

519
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,199
but

520
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,680
um you know you can feel like you can

521
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,199
behave angry

522
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:33,360
angrily but you can also feel angry

523
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,160
um

524
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,759
i keep using angry as an example because

525
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,279
it's a really easy example but the same

526
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,759
thing applies to any other emotion like

527
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,360
similarly you can

528
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,920
behave afraid and you can feel afraid

529
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,279
um

530
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
uh

531
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,240
some emotions it's easier to see what

532
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,920
the behavior is like than others but

533
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,759
there's usually an external counterpoint

534
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,720
an

535
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,519
external part

536
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,000
and the way this usually works is that

537
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,519
basically the emotion you're currently

538
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,040
feeling is the behavior that comes

539
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,400
naturally to you um so

540
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,679
um when you feel angry uh it's very easy

541
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,079
to act angrily and it's very hard not to

542
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:11,679
the world's hard not to

543
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,679
act angrily you can you can control your

544
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,760
behavior but if you sort of naturally

545
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,199
let yourself do

546
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,799
gravitate to

547
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,559
a particular

548
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
to uh sorry if you do the behavior that

549
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,160
comes naturally like what will come out

550
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
is anger you will sort of your voice

551
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
will raise you will sort of take an

552
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,559
aggressive aggressive posture etc

553
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,160
um

554
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,200
and

555
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,640
importantly this happens even when

556
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
you're not aware of your emotions i mean

557
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,000
i i'm sure like most of us have

558
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,400
encountered someone angrily shouting i'm

559
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,919
not angry

560
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:43,360
um or

561
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
like someone going no i'm completely

562
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,200
calm while their hands are shaking on

563
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,679
stage or something and like there is um

564
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,600
when uh like

565
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,120
the part of you that is handling these

566
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,840
emotions is doing its thing even if it

567
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,799
is

568
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,520
even if you're not consciously aware

569
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
of it doing a thing

570
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:03,919
um

571
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,320
and in fact most like when you're not

572
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,000
aware of your emotions

573
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,720
it's very it's even harder to not act on

574
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,720
them because if you don't know you're

575
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,559
angry you can't withhold withdraw from

576
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,400
being angry if you don't know you're

577
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,640
anxious you can't take steps

578
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,200
to do it it's like because of the fact

579
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,320
that

580
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
emotions is doing what comes naturally

581
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,799
you have to notice that like what that

582
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,640
you could do otherwise

583
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:32,640
and if you want to essentially say okay

584
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,640
i'm angry but i don't have to behave

585
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,640
angrily okay i'm afraid but i can do it

586
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,640
anyway it like it really helps to have

587
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
that bit where you say i'm angry i'm

588
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,200
afraid um

589
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,480
um

590
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:46,400
when i say feel emotions i like what i

591
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,919
really mean is like literally you feel

592
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,280
emotions there's

593
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
a common experience that people have of

594
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,160
like assuming that um everyone is using

595
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,960
metaphors um i i got to experience this

596
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,559
with visualization for example like i

597
00:18:58,559 --> 00:18:59,919
don't visualize and so i assumed

598
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,120
everyone who said they had pictures in

599
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,720
their head was using a metaphor or know

600
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,080
that they just have pictures in their

601
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,919
head and this is the same thing with

602
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:07,520
feeling emotions like

603
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,200
um when people say you feel your

604
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,880
emotions like they are literally talking

605
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,280
about physical feelings in your body um

606
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,000
like when you feel angry like your skin

607
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,160
flushes uh when you feel afraid you

608
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,600
might feel sort of tightness here it's

609
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,880
not necessarily the same physical

610
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,160
sensations i think there's a lot of

611
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,280
commonality but

612
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,440
the

613
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,640
if you are currently bad at noticing

614
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:32,240
what your emotions are the thing you

615
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,840
need to do is start paying attention to

616
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,360
physical sensations that map to those

617
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:37,600
behaviors

618
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,280
there are some subtleties to this and um

619
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,600
like not all emotions are like super

620
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,360
obvious physically but if you're not

621
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:46,880
paying attention to the physicality of

622
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:48,960
it that is where you need to start

623
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,280
um the general sense you used to as this

624
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
is called interception it's um it

625
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,480
basically

626
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,559
is just um

627
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,160
the way we are aware of internal

628
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,679
feelings it's like when you notice you

629
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:01,280
have an upset stomach when you notice

630
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,640
that something is hurting that's

631
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,000
interreception

632
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,200
um and this is also what you will use to

633
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,880
actually like learn what you're feeling

634
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,360
and what emotions are experiencing

635
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,200
um

636
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,720
sorry i said this one already uh but

637
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,360
yeah like basically um

638
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,280
the way to notice what emotions you're

639
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:20,880
experiencing is to pay attention to

640
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,559
these physical changes and sort of learn

641
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:26,799
to identify them and recognize them

642
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,720
and this is just something you can get

643
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,440
better at i will provide a reference to

644
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,400
a

645
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,320
book to an annoyingly named therapy

646
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,240
technique called focusing later which is

647
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:37,679
essentially just the skill of getting

648
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:39,280
skilled into reception in order to

649
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
understand your emotions it's um

650
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,480
like it's easier for some people than

651
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:44,080
others but it's uh

652
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:47,360
um it is just a learnable skill

653
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:48,720
um

654
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,480
i've been talking about parts like part

655
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,240
of me wants this part of me once

656
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,720
believes that um and

657
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,600
uh

658
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,200
this is from this is another therapy

659
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,039
thing um but it is also just like

660
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:00,559
literally like part of the normal

661
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:01,919
language like people say this sort of

662
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:03,280
thing all the time

663
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,039
and

664
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,720
it's

665
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,159
once you start sort of paying attention

666
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
to feelings like it's really annoying

667
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,200
because like the

668
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,799
the a lot of the things people say about

669
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:14,640
parts sound nonsensical until they sound

670
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,880
obvious

671
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,400
and like the most nonsensical sounding

672
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,600
ones it is useful thinking of these

673
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,600
parts as people in their own right like

674
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,120
it's useful imagining like there is a

675
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,200
little version inside you that is

676
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,919
angry you or they're oh and um is

677
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,919
currently the bit going no i want to

678
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,600
shout i want to um

679
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,320
do this um

680
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,919
this isn't literally true probably um

681
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:39,600
like some some people experience it as

682
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,559
more literally true than others um

683
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,559
i think i've

684
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,480
i've had experiences of sort of doing

685
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:48,480
work with parts and feelings where i

686
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,679
know where

687
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:51,840
like the best way i can describe it is

688
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,840
that the part informed me that yes it

689
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,480
had a name and this as i say this feels

690
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,240
ridiculous until it seems obvious but

691
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,679
like don't don't worry too much about

692
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:02,159
the literalness of it um the way i think

693
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,679
is most useful in captions is you know

694
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,120
the thing that people say if i'm a

695
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:06,880
different person when i'm with my family

696
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,240
with them for when i'm with my friends

697
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,000
or in this context like

698
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,840
your parts are those different different

699
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:15,120
people like they're different versions

700
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,880
of you and those different versions of

701
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
you are um

702
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,039
all simultaneously present and just come

703
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
out when in situations

704
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:24,799
that

705
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:27,520
need them and you can access sort of

706
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,360
like the feeling of what it would be

707
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
like to be that version of you

708
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,960
independently of those situations by

709
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,080
just basically poking at it with

710
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,760
interception

711
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:36,799
um

712
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,080
and

713
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,880
um again i will provide a reference to a

714
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,720
book afterwards for sort of doing parts

715
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,120
work um but

716
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,159
um

717
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,919
but this is but this is what i mean when

718
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,840
i say a part i mean like a version of

719
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,039
you that you can access in some

720
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:53,200
circumstance

721
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,400
um

722
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,159
like i say feeling an emotion is a

723
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:57,760
strategic choice like the part the part

724
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,600
of you doesn't feel an emotion because

725
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:02,240
um like just for the laws i mean it

726
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,720
might if the emotion is humor but um

727
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,720
um like it has learned at some point

728
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:09,919
that this is a useful reaction um like

729
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,200
uh

730
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,960
when i'm scared of screwing up by

731
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,440
introducing myself to people um that was

732
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,280
a legitimate fear back in school like it

733
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,039
wasn't that i

734
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,240
made up in my own head that um

735
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,559
no that bad things could go badly wrong

736
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:25,679
there were actually circumstances in

737
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:26,880
which things could go badly wrong and i

738
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,960
learned that reaction

739
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:29,320
um

740
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,799
[Music]

741
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,200
and yeah sorry i've got to hit my slides

742
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,840
again um and yeah so so these emotional

743
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:38,400
responses are learned from experience um

744
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,480
that doesn't mean they're right and it

745
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,600
doesn't mean they're right either

746
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,760
because like they've overlearned them

747
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,880
they've learned them in a situation

748
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,039
where it doesn't apply um

749
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:48,720
it also just also just like sometimes

750
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,159
they're wrong because like sometimes

751
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,679
we're wrong um it's uh

752
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,760
and certainly i've learned emotional

753
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,600
responses in response to things that

754
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,440
existed entirely in my head at the time

755
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,799
and don't actually make sense even in

756
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,000
retrospect but like usually they are

757
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,840
more right than wrong

758
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:06,720
um

759
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,840
but most importantly you should probably

760
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:09,279
take it seriously regardless of whether

761
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,440
it's right or wrong like one of the

762
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,000
reasons why it's useful to

763
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,159
think of emotion of hearts as people in

764
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,159
their own right is this teaches you how

765
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,320
to treat your emotions um

766
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,120
if

767
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,279
like if a friend of yours is current

768
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:25,360
comes to you and is just like i'm really

769
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,039
afraid of this scenario happening you

770
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:29,039
don't go oh you idiot you don't need to

771
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,440
be afraid of that it's um

772
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,480
nothing's wrong you're worrying for

773
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:35,200
nothing you're overreacting like um it

774
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,200
feels about as bad when you treat a part

775
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,400
like that as it does when someone else

776
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,760
hurts you like that

777
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,080
and so

778
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,840
going in and sort of taking these

779
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,600
reactions as seriously and treating them

780
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:50,320
um as like in principle likely to be

781
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,600
right even

782
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,760
but

783
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,120
not necessarily completely right is the

784
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,559
way to go

785
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,360
um sorry i'm just going to skim through

786
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,600
this i have slightly mistimed everything

787
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,400
um

788
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,080
but yeah so one of the sort of important

789
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:08,320
things to access with interception is

790
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,039
like a sense of what feels true it's

791
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:12,080
um

792
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:12,840
when

793
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,559
you

794
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:17,200
um like when you say something out loud

795
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:19,520
pay attention to the sense of like ah is

796
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,159
that right is that or is it more like

797
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:23,039
this

798
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,279
um and so you can basically gain more

799
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:28,559
access to

800
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,640
a lot of this information by saying

801
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,919
things like

802
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:33,600
part of me believes this part of me

803
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,840
wants to do that and seeing like how the

804
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
feeling changes how the feeling responds

805
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,080
uh an exercise i sometimes get people to

806
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,600
do is just go around saying like

807
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,440
obviously nonsensical things and seeing

808
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
like what the feeling of like oh that's

809
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,880
not right is like

810
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:47,840
um

811
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,240
the population of the uk is 400 million

812
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
population the uk is not flooded just to

813
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,600
clarify

814
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,120
the sky is pink

815
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,480
um like

816
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
noticing the instantaneous reaction

817
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
basically oh that's not right and

818
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,520
correcting from that

819
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,520
and you can

820
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:05,440
do this with emotions as well you and

821
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,799
you see you can see this if you go

822
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
through some of my work examples like

823
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,600
um trying to

824
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,360
pay attention to where the feeling is

825
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,520
coming from what it means and

826
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,690
home in on a true version

827
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:20,640
[Music]

828
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:22,159
and

829
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:23,760
using this you can sort of take these

830
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,000
emotional beliefs these reactions like

831
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,799
um i should be angry i should be sad and

832
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,600
go like where is this coming from

833
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,640
um

834
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,840
does this still make sense in context um

835
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:36,840
and

836
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,480
um

837
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,840
and

838
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,000
um what are the emotionally salient

839
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:43,279
differences

840
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:44,320
uh

841
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,480
it is hard to do this in the moment um

842
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:48,640
usually i find this is better in advance

843
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,640
of the thing i'm worried about or doing

844
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:54,480
essentially a postmortem of going um so

845
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,320
that's how this felt was that right or

846
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,439
could i have done this differently

847
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,120
um

848
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,640
but i think like all this actually

849
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,240
starts with not like trying to change

850
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,520
your emotional responses but basically

851
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,039
just learning to treat them as useful

852
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,600
information

853
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,200
and asking like what you want to do and

854
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
then actually doing it

855
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,720
you can

856
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,840
i think

857
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,279
those of us who are bad at emotions

858
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,399
i guess

859
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,799
i would pass tense from

860
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:25,200
sometimes past tense for me um

861
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,880
uh like often it's very tempting to just

862
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,559
override the emotion and go nope this is

863
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,399
what i've got to do um but paying

864
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:32,399
attention to these feelings and going

865
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:34,159
okay how do i take this into account

866
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:35,840
well this is like what what should i do

867
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,840
based on that what do i want to do

868
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,120
um is the first start

869
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:42,960
um often this is particular like what

870
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,039
would make us feel safer like

871
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,960
if some part of us is worried about

872
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,039
things going horribly wrong

873
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,039
you can just make plans to stop things

874
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,020
from going horribly wrong

875
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,320

876
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,480
and

877
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,720
yeah

878
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,480
so yeah basically just don't treat your

879
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,240
emotions automatically wrong it's very

880
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,480
easy to do that and like

881
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,919
don't uh and will tend to not help

882
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:10,000
um but don't do things on nightly right

883
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,200
either like go in with sort of open

884
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,159
curiosity and go maybe um what's up

885
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,480
what's up with that like

886
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,679
um and either um

887
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:22,080
and either act on it or um try to adjust

888
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,039
it

889
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,240
um

890
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,039
you

891
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:26,720
have to be prepared to like take it into

892
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,600
account with um

893
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,480
and act accordingly but you don't have

894
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,840
to do sort of the naive thing just

895
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,880
because you're angry doesn't mean you

896
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,720
have to shout it can it can mean you

897
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,159
calmly explain to someone why what they

898
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:39,840
did was wrong

899
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:41,840
um and you're going to get this wrong um

900
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:43,039
it's impossible to get this right all

901
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:44,399
the time because getting it right all

902
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,159
the time is essentially acting perfectly

903
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:49,039
in all situations and nobody does that

904
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,559
but every time

905
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,080
these things come up you can do better

906
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,159
for the next time

907
00:28:54,159 --> 00:28:54,560
um

[Music]

909
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,520
yeah

910
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,600
and so basically what i want you to take

911
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,679
away from this is to integrate your

912
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,679
emotions better into your life try to

913
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,480
learn to understand them and try to

914
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,360
feel better every time things go wrong

915
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:13,840
feel better and better

916
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:16,240
here are some for some further reading

917
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,080
i've written an article about this which

918
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,760
has some overlap with this talks it

919
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,200
elaborates on some bits and this is

920
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,399
about some others

921
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,880
these are two books i do recommend

922
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,360
i'm sorry these books are quite woo um

923
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,760
all of the best books on therapy are a

924
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,919
bit strange and you do need to go in

925
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,399
taking them not um even less or

926
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:36,080
differently seriously than you would me

927
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,840
but certainly not too seriously

928
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,120
um and

929
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,679
um i wish you all the best of luck uh

930
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:46,320
thank you very much and i will be around

931
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,799
for questions afterwards
