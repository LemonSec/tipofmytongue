1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,650
so you're probably thinking this is the
most boring taught you have heard in

2
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,070
this entire learning session

3
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:17,759
them just a bit background while Ben
setting this up

4
00:00:17,759 --> 00:00:21,539
we are a team of 12 who've been doing
for stayed over the weekend

5
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,849
and where all people who would have been
MF anyway

6
00:00:24,849 --> 00:00:28,679
but we've spent some other time over
intent there and

7
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:31,689
one other things any viewer for Snyder's
10

8
00:00:31,689 --> 00:00:36,059
is the bane of our lives if pieces of
paper because you've got someone who's

9
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:36,559
still

10
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:40,010
you but mississippi's paper and pen you
try to navigate that at the same time

11
00:00:40,010 --> 00:00:41,370
and everything else you try to do

12
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,649
it's been a nightmare so been decided

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,399
when he was acting up I love this that
he wanted to find a different way to do

14
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:48,809
it

15
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:51,860
and we're gonna have a demo

16
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:56,219
which I hope you can see on screen a
might have a

17
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:03,219
be its back

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:06,860
we get

19
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:11,000
that they have them okay so

20
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:14,460
might be below excellent

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,660
so like a lot of people I am

22
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,560
someone turnarounds will now I'll see
inset quake everyone she got a Currys

23
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,790
because they're selling knocks off cheap
but they quit

24
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:27,730
several knows I am buys them and land
does nothing with them

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,090
leaving them in their best rules
including me and so we have an idea that

26
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,170
we should probably use this to duel
operation report forms on because we

27
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,200
didn't want to carry around

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,790
lots a big bits a paper I am if anyone's
ever used as a jobs report form

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,680
or seen a land ambulance ripple forms
and they're quite nasty

30
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,060
I am and quite verbose and come in
triplicate

31
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,420
ands get wet and horrible and then they
get thrown away when you hand them over

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:55,190
to an ambulance cuz there were many like

33
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,630
I'm so we thought wanna is not because

34
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,729
the battery lasts for ever I'm and you
can use them

35
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,380
while wearing gloves or even people
throw up on them on

36
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,490
so you know cuz that they're not ready
the resistive it'll

37
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,760
and a USSSA infrared as I believe so
woman is due to quit little demo

38
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,130
with this even as a side down which I to
go about sorry

39
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:20,730

this is really dug a very well as a

70
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,610
should be should have thought this
through the phone ok fine

71
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:09,310
if the computer the smiling answer yep
that is a bit delayed

72
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:14,270
I'm how dare the

73
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:18,590
I the its website called up

74
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,858
good thing that miss we've been running
the system or the whole weekend and this

75
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:23,930
is the first time anything has gone
wrong with it

76
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:27,350
and apart from a really weird but that
we had a beginning

77
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:31,050
which was that from minor injury it that
came up saying the patient had lost

78
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,490
consciousness though

79
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,350
we have to correct that because we
didn't really have anybody losing

80
00:04:35,350 --> 00:04:36,630
consciousness and

81
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:42,360
minute cut the finger okay buyers little
bit better

82
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,840
okay so essentially a you've got that
which is with

83
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,000
we would be filled in so are you on any
medications or do you have any known

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,520
allergies

85
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,820
about 10 months I was but nothing else
okay see kids love

86
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:00,669
it is lovely blue ring thing when you
scroll across the top is kinda deserted

87
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:01,250
to see

88
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:07,080
I am okay I you can fill in bits so the
head and face the arms legs or whatever

89
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:08,440
actually put in extra details

90
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,330
whereabouts looted did did the Bob us to
be Obama finger

91
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:16,270
all your figure okay Singh Phillaur fill
out the dead

92
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,580
I am leaving a log

93
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:23,020
observations is interesting what should
we take a blood pressure do think we

94
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:23,630
need to do that

95
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:27,909
I may have lost a lot of fluid okay fed
up

96
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:31,360
so we can start filling in makes like
all had to be admitted oxygen

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,890
with is it painful responses things like
that and we can keep doing that overtime

98
00:05:35,890 --> 00:05:39,510
a hot treatment

99
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:42,630
so should we do plaster I think elder
fair enough

100
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:47,250
can have another from flowers well yeah
okay

101
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:50,970
this is the former it really don't want
to have to use a

102
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:55,500
because it did not talk about
resuscitation a

103
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,600
and also the ambulance bet so we can
sell filling the call sign up the

104
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,660
ambulance when they arrived in when they
disappeared

105
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:05,020
saying though that we haven't used
either of those this weekend

106
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:09,090
been remarkably site yes possibly even
what we wanted to have

107
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:14,099
has been very safe yeah yeah

108
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,670
were on Sep 10 till tomorrow yeah okay
so we can't we have notes

109
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:22,730
and then that the final bit you know the
outcome I'm

110
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:24,260
ok

111
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,520
Co be denied I'm

112
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,990
so yeah

113
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:33,380
a are the poll be walking aidid thanks
I'm off back to nothing I rode

114
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:36,830
buyer lol

115
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:40,820
the last night which I quite like it
effectively we have decided

116
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,780
sir know you've got a a little but box
here that you can so to put a big

117
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:49,150
signature in is it about it

118
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:52,950
but axe and the thing about this that we
like the most though is because

119
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,990
most the time you don't need a full page
report form

120
00:06:55,990 --> 00:07:00,090
and so we wanted to do is so get the to
beat it did for us

121
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,789
if we can and some is gonna

122
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,180
not bother with that one and we got this
option here coal miner we invest

123
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:11,550
so this is the majority what we have to
deal with that fills in things at a

124
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,330
location first day boyd's

125
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:17,690
I it was a self-referral and other bits
get filled in the treatment bet

126
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:22,180
we actually have a at a special version
that we made to the that today

127
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:26,560
lol area map estate about problem be a
public problem about as working

129
00:07:32,030 --> 00:07:32,599
right away

130
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:37,010

132
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,900

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,890

allergic to data transfer okay fair
enough

140
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:18,570
a secure survey to think then

141
00:08:18,570 --> 00:08:21,800
observations earlier treatment I think

143

145
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:35,100
actually make it here that has actually
happened we've been there basically

146
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,380
doing first aid for people ambuj is the
Nexus 7

147

it we basically days we

148
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:47,020
we sign of and has had before

149
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,260
and then at the end what happens is we
effectively encrypting on the device

150
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,830
Anna if you press yes and while that is
ill-equipped on here

151
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:59,890
and then we just that affectively taking
off manually

152
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,920
we haven't connected these to the at the
wifi at but it turns out that other

153
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,740
