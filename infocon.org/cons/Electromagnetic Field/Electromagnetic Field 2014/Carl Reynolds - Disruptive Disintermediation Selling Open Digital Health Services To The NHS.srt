1
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:12,229
poor slash day of a job

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:15,980
a.m. at 2014

3
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:19,939
say I'm gonna festival try to persuade
you to NHS IT

4
00:00:19,939 --> 00:00:24,289
really could be a lot less bad I that is
gonna great state at the moment

5
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:27,680
and then I'm going to speculate as to a

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,060
why that might be hopefully in a
plausible way

7
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:34,210
and then I'm gonna let you know about

8
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:38,480
what we've been up say so far trying to
sort this out hopefully persuade you to

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:38,980
get involved

10
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:44,578
can anybody see

11
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:47,620
something on on the screens near the

12
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,659
or I'm online just black

13
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,300
it is just black then the puzzle will be
a bit their heart

14
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:59,108
okay says a picture of a

15
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:03,339
a chest x-ray and the question is is the
nasal gastric cue

16
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:07,229
in place if you could see it cannery
feared if they wanna

17
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:10,920
speculate on sir maybe

18
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,049
good is in the lung yes a Starbucks on
the left hand side and

19
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:19,450
and the the Chiefs games for the right
the way the film is

20
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,380
say Stephanie the wrong place and I saw
this sorry just is an 80

21
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:28,240
other well actually we're dealing with
concrete things in health care

22
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,720
and this is an example of a better
health information that

23
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,530
know having access to a I'm I have a
real consequence

24
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,840
say where the stage on his right knee is
not as good as it could be

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,560
I can tell you three short stories about
that 1 I've never post that pic she saw

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,330
a moment ago

27
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:52,480
not so long ago a I'm I was working in
intensive care unit I'm a dog training

28
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,390
and again by the way

29
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,170
and I was their response would also for
the intensive care unit in the nighttime

30
00:01:58,170 --> 00:02:01,880
and intensive care doctors essentially
put troops into troops

31
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,929
I measure will go through the shapes and
from time to time you need to make sure

32
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,660
that she was in the right place usually
just of dividend

33
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,579
that's quite important having achieved
is defeating in your lungs

34
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,890
rather than your stomach his this highly
sub-optimal

35
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:19,929
and it they happen to me happens to me
in

36
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,019
in 25 2014

37
00:02:23,019 --> 00:02:27,129
this this year earlier this year
happened about 4 o'clock in the morning

38
00:02:27,129 --> 00:02:31,268
I was unable to say any of that the
x-ray system is down I was unable to say

39
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:32,390
any of the images

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,689
and I had several on well patients who
have been doing things today

41
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:39,510
and it mattered I law me to be able to
see what was going on

42
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:46,170
and the system let me down that's a
shame but what's even more for shame

43
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,730
is that the mechanisms for learning from
that failure

44
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:55,738
I also let me down say I for iPhone
incident at a time in this is supposedly

45
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:58,879
someday they would get back to me within
an hour the hotline that I code

46
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,709
they didn't get back to me I filled out
an infinitive form

47
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,200
and I'm not so convinced that this
wouldn't happen again

48
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,138
it will happen again and that's the
problem

49
00:03:10,139 --> 00:03:13,739
the second tile was when I was a bit
more

50
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,169
a bit more junior highs working
ambassador then and and

51
00:03:17,169 --> 00:03:21,040
there is a patient had had a fractured
neck a fear that falling over the broken

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,679
ahead

53
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:25,299
and unbeknownst to the team looking
after them

54
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:29,560
and also very very recently within the
last week or so had a camera test

55
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,609
because they've been

56
00:03:30,609 --> 00:03:34,900
anemic in Tonopah to comment on how to
look into that stir into the

57
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:38,609
stomach and it also had elected into
that bow and

58
00:03:38,609 --> 00:03:42,169
this lady of the shit how to help fix
was very slow to get better

59
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:46,599
and we were really encouraging hata move
around but she had pain there was really

60
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,810
no in keeping with

61
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:51,009
so it's a pain that people normally have
off a historic affects

62
00:03:51,009 --> 00:03:57,099
unfortunately when they had done the
camera test at half price about

63
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:01,358
and we didn't know about that because
when we

64
00:04:01,359 --> 00:04:06,430
when we look at what's going on with the
patient at the moment in the NHS

65
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:10,439
we frequently have to look at lots lots
the different systems is very fragmented

66
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:12,620
say the blood results will be in one
place

67
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:17,320
X-rays have been another and of could be
wrong report so this particular hospital

68
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:20,329
were uploaded of the some arbitrary time

69
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:22,849
time frame into another

70
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:27,229
online chat hold up and that situation
is

71
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,318
is dangerous cuz you can very easily and

72
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:33,639
innocent human factors for me the very
very easily if you make it really

73
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,449
difficult to see a comprehensive view of
somebody's problems

74
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:40,629
you can very easily have people working
with that an incomplete be

75
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,319
and then you can have something like
this being met say

76
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:47,750
that lady died she nobody realized I
have powers

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:52,159
was perforated until it was too late and
I think there is a

78
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:55,409
it would be much much more likely that
we would have worked out what was going

79
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,550
on if we'd known

80
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,020
the recent events that happened to the
fat tail

81
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:04,940
I'm kind of forays into the question the

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,580
is this offer communication breakdown is
always the same say

83
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:13,620
and this is just

84
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:17,139
the case unfortunately that frequently
we r

85
00:05:17,139 --> 00:05:20,759
I am communicating using things like
pages

86
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,930
and fax machines and there is a

87
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:28,800
there is not capture a fkn there's no
good digital capture of the

88
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,789
communication

89
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:33,360
and not infrequently people are lost to
follow-up

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,440
I or test that doctors wish their
patients had don't don't happen they

91
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,479
initiate the request for the test but
its

92
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,750
just lost the system how the fax machine
breaks something like this

93
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,680
and that's that's another a

94
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,130
barry very real day-to-day problem

95
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,520
say we have these

96
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,008
the saucer from really they say they
said they seem intractable waste

97
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:05,400
a issues as they near I practiced four
years I've been working 0 ths

98
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,349
it doesn't doesn't and there's not a an
appreciable

99
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:14,090
have feeling that it's getting better
the people on the front line really want

100
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:16,049
to make it work and and the

101
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:20,060
the question I'm for a living the high
life if it is an immense pressure on the

102
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,370
people in the front line to

103
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,600
together right so how does the
receptionist fact there are 40 caught

104
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,479
this too thick for the fax machine

105
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,349
anyone I

106
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:35,229
she for you to go he's a yeah I mean
this is the

107
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,190
this really sad that there is a fax
machine but i think thats what ive

108
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,229
innovation

109
00:06:40,229 --> 00:06:43,590
and the people on the front line a
desperate to make it work as if you

110
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:45,320
don't make it work then

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,800
your patience to do less well you have
to stay longer in the hospital visits

112
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:52,210
and efficient there isn't a spectacular
mountain of goodwill and

113
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:56,310
energy being applied to to cope out with
a broken system

114
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,860
say

115
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:03,190
I think fundamentally if a system where
are able to a

116
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,300
to be a learning system into more
quickly evolved and

117
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:10,870
closely follows we get better quite
quickly but why these problems here i

118
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,280
mean

119
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,119
as he surely someone just follow the bug
report on the stuff gets fixed

120
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,639
well there isn't really a bug reporting
the

121
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,419
system for the NHS the crisis that we
have is a safety system

122
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,229
called the national reporting and
landing system at a bar abolished

123
00:07:27,229 --> 00:07:27,969
recently with a

124
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:31,560
they maintain the functions those no
kinda which

125
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,889
is a system for whenever something on
toward unexpected happens

126
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,710
medical that health-care professional
recognizes I'm

127
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,479
to a patient there they fill out
incident form

128
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,050
and supposedly that would be then elated
centrally

129
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,850
and anything that factional animal from
these events would

130
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:54,390
will be fed back to assist them and this
is the effect now work for the National

131
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:55,789
Patient Safety Agency that

132
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:00,270
I that maintains a system for for if a
year on the common

133
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:05,200
and i staying out health informatics
must be used at a time

134
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,349
and i fix it the subset have safety
incidents they relate to

135
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,130
healthcare information systems same
software essentially as

136
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,790
and as a an area to look in a bit more
that and there were seven thousand two

137
00:08:17,790 --> 00:08:19,510
hundred seventy three incidents

138
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:22,680
this is that if you can see that the

139
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,700
society pretty picture I think this is a
I'm

140
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,969
handling a cluster analysis for the free
text that the incidence

141
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,330
it is I think there is a hierarchical
clustering I'm going to that's typically

142
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,610
use for web results snippets so if you
search for something like Apache

143
00:08:36,610 --> 00:08:40,330
you would hope that a class with Apache
helicopters Apache Indians in

144
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:44,730
without say this is entirely automated
it comes out with the source if things

145
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,350
which

146
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:49,260
the resonate with with frontline health
professionals the computer is unable to

147
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:49,990
do stuff

148
00:08:49,990 --> 00:08:54,980
as you keep Yukon I Yukon communique you
can access the system's

149
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:00,800
stuff falls over frequently set
limitations about how often the person

150
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,290
reporting the incident

151
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:06,719
I'm is ignorant say they will let me
this on a granularity the you gonna get

152
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,440
in your

153
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,830
bug report is he didn't do I wanted to
do

154
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,030
there's no to I'm you can be difficult
to reproduce these bugs are actually

155
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,230
drew down and see what's going what's
going on

156
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,050
also this massive under reporting to the
very little incentive to airport in a

157
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:22,699
system where you think anything back

158
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,850
and I i common search string not found
in this dataset

159
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:31,710
is still not fixed broken again you know
men's frustration probably before people

160
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,830
give up and don't bother reporting it
all

161
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:37,390
cuz there are not serve ongoing issues
and there's no

162
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:42,480
adequate adequate mechanisms to fix them
with respect broken so far in NHS

163
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,100
complete failing with a big problem

164
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,980
we still using bleeps pages this service

165
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:53,079
say why they like that

166
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:57,349
and you can say if he did say leadership
like special now so I think that's part

167
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,839
of the problem instance for even more
subtle not

168
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,069
that markets I is broken or

169
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:07,829
or performing sub optimally the end-user
lacks influence a there's no means to

170
00:10:07,829 --> 00:10:08,359
make the

171
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:12,740
miss the broken system better frequently
there's no you can vote with your feet

172
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,819
as you can in the consumer market

173
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:19,019
you have a middleware that in the
hospital administration a by sis

174
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:19,589
software

175
00:10:19,589 --> 00:10:22,920
and then a sort of coercive
implementation that leaves the

176
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:27,579
than you do in a choice respect for the
happiest but also granularity problem

177
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,290
west of where is commissioned

178
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:33,618
and at the wrong level I think it's not
it doesn't meet the specialist needs of

179
00:10:33,619 --> 00:10:34,420
the individual

180
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:38,479
clinical teams which is why you often
have trouble getting people to use

181
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,670
electronic systems rather than just
sticking with

182
00:10:40,670 --> 00:10:44,199
and their paper prices that frequently
are a lot more optimized for their

183
00:10:44,199 --> 00:10:45,040
particular needs

184
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,129
then there are structural barriers say

185
00:10:48,129 --> 00:10:51,139
there are really quite okay procurement
processes

186
00:10:51,139 --> 00:10:55,370
again not set up for their the right
level of granularity of buying software

187
00:10:55,370 --> 00:11:00,100
as information governance where at
always his is bandied around this as a

188
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:01,269
block and there's lotsa

189
00:11:01,269 --> 00:11:05,389
I'm I i think there is a couple of
professionals within the NHS

190
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:08,399
I T and administrative function here

191
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,399
really have been bought up in very close
relation with the larger vendors and

192
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,509
a very quick to and teary

193
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:19,819
Prof at per five big I more enterprise

194
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:23,360
I'm solutions and information governance

195
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,480
minutiae perhaps rather than focusing on
usability and and what the actual

196
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,360
need the software meets and three

197
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:35,709
a they have rather than using the
internet and secure means to communicate

198
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:37,268
air into their own

199
00:11:37,269 --> 00:11:42,459
secure network and three which is a big
barrier to entry if your smaller

200
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:45,569
and he tried to do business in the NHS
and then there's

201
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:49,180
de facto if you're trying to be
something light webapps

202
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:52,439
and that my so the hospital many
hospitals

203
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,880
still use ie7 I is is a problem just

204
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:00,180
technically when you trying to make a
javascript application I run fosse's

205
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,719
that's really have another barrier to
entry say I think

206
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,940
black reviews the focus would be a

207
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:13,150
I'm a big bag bad that you have as an
end-user's picture an unfriendly

208
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:17,130
Teeple that and you may or may not
recognize from a nice

209
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:23,430
work on usability you to design so final
part I

210
00:12:23,430 --> 00:12:26,620
practice right either things definitely
could be a lot better

211
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:30,570
I I speculated as the a

212
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:34,090
some other reasons why that might be the
they aren't as good as they could be

213
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:37,890
and hope for your persuaded that is
important optimize

214
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:41,760
healthcare did so services far as
possible

215
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,700
given that most about value of how I'm
quite highly

216
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:50,830
so what we do I think championing their
health operation aspect of the health

217
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:51,480
service

218
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,290
say what was the health service for I to
add

219
00:12:55,290 --> 00:12:59,890
ideally looking of that and everybody
making sure they don't get sick as far

220
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:00,600
as possible

221
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,970
treating them appropriately when they
affect I'm

222
00:13:03,970 --> 00:13:07,560
whether of him the question of whether
or not the systems we have in place

223
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:11,290
me that need as well as they could do i
think is a real important starting point

224
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,540
and said to send patients and clinicians
can be champions about

225
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,839
I we have a thing called the NHS Hack
Day which is stereo NHS and they don't

226
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:19,490
calm

227
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:23,100
on which the men who set up a couple
years ago under the banner peekskill up

228
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:23,880
the NHS

229
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,590
have seen everybody is welcome had to
come along to this event we

230
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:31,180
we have that and we have a former white
people

231
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,599
pitch problems that they have
experienced and and have had service

232
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,990
and then we

233
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:40,160
I'm thread prototype solutions to them
but it's a lot of fun

234
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,579
and most different people different
species meters quite positive thing

235
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:46,930
mister showcase how much you can get on
with open source software and open

236
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:47,709
governance

237
00:13:47,709 --> 00:13:53,949
as possible and then finally I have fun
I have a startup would open house KK I'm

238
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,310
I'm the CEO and cofounder of it and we
have

239
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,719
a real-life NHS open source open
governance project

240
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,390
at UCLA age and where we have we have a
contractual relationship with them their

241
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:07,120
pay for us to develop software that

242
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,600
I we're developing software in a
entirely open-source an open government

243
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,350
and fashion so que habla con for such
open

244
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,700
health care for such opal you can see
individual

245
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:23,160
I'm healthcare professionals doctors
nurses raising issues requesting new

246
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,120
features and you can see us responding
to them

247
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:29,279
you can help if you if you are I'm if
you have the means to

248
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,189
that would be before so I'm get involved
this paper the set is ours

249
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:37,730
not set say I'd love to hear your
thoughts on

250
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:40,839
what I said and a few things anything
out of that

251
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:44,730
we should be doing could be doing now
I've missed thank you very much for

252
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:51,730
listening

253
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:55,220
this way

254
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,100
so the next NHS hot day

255
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:04,010
is in its Nexus month ago I had to be
says 27th and 28th

256
00:15:04,010 --> 00:15:07,790
during check on NHS acted upon and it's
gonna be in Leeds

257
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,219
and say we do them roughly every four
months and a place where they are

258
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:12,730
various

259
00:15:12,730 --> 00:15:19,730
any other questions

260
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,990
hi and so it's all very well having an
open source project

261
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:30,440
to solve a health problem how difficult
have you found it taking something has

262
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,589
been developed in actually getting into
minted within the NHS

263
00:15:33,589 --> 00:15:37,540
yeah say the primary mention every poll
as

264
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,800
is in the NHS and you have theory we
have the same challenges that any

265
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:44,329
commercial software vendor has an NHS a

266
00:15:44,330 --> 00:15:48,180
you have to find a customer you have to
satisfy the customer the committee or

267
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,060
their information governance
requirements

268
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:53,589
you have to come over overcome the
barriers that I mentioned in terms if

269
00:15:53,589 --> 00:15:56,060
and three in browsers and so on

270
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,699
say you know it's it's hard but I think
they're

271
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,130
11 means for doing a stair and harness

272
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,830
the dissatisfaction at the end user and
in particular that is a powerful group

273
00:16:07,830 --> 00:16:10,089
venues as in NHS hospitals which is

274
00:16:10,089 --> 00:16:13,550
the the medical a body reconcile
somebody in particular

275
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:17,689
that's kinda been re- 10 my way to meet
their needs and they can see that we

276
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:20,480
helping them to look up to their
patients in a more efficient way

277
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,640
they're able to then and push forward to
that to the relative

278
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,670
but put pressure on Iran the relevant
administrative

279
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:32,120
functions of people there are involved
with procurement have so far another

280
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:38,450
question

281
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:41,480
yet and can you tell as a little bit
more about what

282
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,529
a pole and said dot is and what it does
shot with the Internet yeah

283
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:50,019
NHS IT SEZ yet say I iPhone is a
framework for

284
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,250
looking of the lesser pace for patients
and managing

285
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,959
wards a patient from them I'm and then
we have

286
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,099
using the prime why we week that we
customize and we charge for

287
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
customization and

288
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,670
deployment and support and not use and
age they have

289
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:09,569
I'm some people that they call al Said
which is barren

290
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,178
I'm customized version of up alright
hope of being able

291
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:16,959
and that stands for the electronic
clinical infections the this database

292
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,240
they use it to keep a list of all of the
patients that have an infectious disease

293
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,709
and Infectious Diseases team I look
softer and to keep track of the progress

294
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:29,460
that have the patience for making papers
impatient and as outpatients

295
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,170
and the value proposition for them other
than it being more fish in having a

296
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:38,160
paperless tortoise in a Word document or
Excel spreadsheet had to give them an

297
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,040
audit trail

298
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:46,040
and they can happen con access they can
use it for research

299
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,600
say to my knowledge there on any

300
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,649
other open source open government
projects in the NHS it would welcome

301
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,680
your contribution

302
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,780
add to den today or tomorrow that you
could raise an issue with

303
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:03,170
in a public way it and you said today or
tomorrow I'm going to take a less

304
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,580
problem no I don't think why they're our
rivals solutions but there isn't

305
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,120
anything this university adopted

306
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:11,239
probably them there most commonly use

307
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:14,730
thing for this problem is that what
document on Excel spreadsheet I think

308
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:18,340
that's because if they customization
individual clinical teams made

309
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:25,340
you get when you have a blank she like
her a wide open

310
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,110
Hyatt do these customizations get put
back into

311
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:35,590
the project so they can be used
elsewhere to hospitals

312
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:40,189
yesterday it's all on you say take a hub
da compost life-saving health care for

313
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:40,580
such

314
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,629
opal and everything the

315
00:18:43,630 --> 00:18:46,740
everything that we doing is a Hyundai
with their business models say is we

316
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,720
want to just charge for customization

317
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,750
and deployment and support there's no

318
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:55,220
release all opens open open I spent on
it also stole

319
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,210
open governance is how I would welcome
contributions from people outside of our

320
00:18:59,210 --> 00:18:59,960
organization

321
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:06,960
what do the big players like UGA Draka

322
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:11,480
I static systems thing couple you within

323
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:18,480
if the source movement how they handle a
I think I'm far too small to have them

324
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,480
at this stage there have been I they say
they have been in NHS England

325
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,790
possibly partly as a result of our
efforts has and there's now an NHS open

326
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:29,780
source program

327
00:19:29,780 --> 00:19:33,570
say I i think some of them are paying
lip service there

328
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:36,570
open standards and open API things at
this time

329
00:19:36,570 --> 00:19:39,939
rather than going as far as actually
embracing

330
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:43,750
I open it now open source labor
government stop I'm

331
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,450
but I think I would too a.m. we know how
I think them enough if they're winning

332
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,620
too many

333
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,419
multi-million pound contracts for
delivering no good enough software

334
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,100
unfortunately

335
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:56,120
hi

336
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,340
I'm what you doing some really amazing
but I was wondering if it may need

337
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,080
something like

338
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,750
GDS the equivalent at GDS to come in
really revolutionize

339
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:08,400
kinda right even the NHS something with
that level have clout

340
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,730
now and I will not be brilliant I think
the

341
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,010
the setup for making that happen is is
difficult because if they're

342
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:20,690
the White hospital the setup I mean you
know that

343
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:25,299
I could change but they have I'm enid
aidid

344
00:20:25,299 --> 00:20:29,000
money alter ultimately does come
centrally from the public out there any

345
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
testing them and so on

346
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:34,820
say I mean they could they could be I'm
some means for doing that another way

347
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:37,610
and I would fully support as adult I
would

348
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:41,199
working for the NHS with came out noted
NHS I would

349
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:45,840
love to be doing one day with my startup
inside the NHS in at

350
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,918
PDF equipment or something like that
were possible I'm

351
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:53,330
attentively I I think trust may SunTrust

352
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,918
may just get the value proposition
actually you can

353
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:00,190
antibody Karen reduce your cost I'm

354
00:21:00,190 --> 00:21:04,340
by have supplied by using more open
source

355
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:07,370
I was hoping to make san martin
governance was on there really is

356
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,129
eyes kinda with a win win for the
benefit to patients but it does say

357
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:15,620
commercially strategic say I think you
maybe that's the way that this change

358
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,699
happens rather than

359
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:23,700
GDS coming and going over how I would
welcome them

360
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:34,360
now to get any other questions

361
00:21:34,879 --> 00:21:41,879
thank you very much well
