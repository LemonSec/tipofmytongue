1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,140

Romeo Yankees here and also

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:22,439
November 0 from you again he's here and
I was that

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,869
this is actually a what be this this
call plane was awarded to me

6
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:30,099
just today have it's an American call
sign but strangely enough actually took

7
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,579
the test in Cambridge

8
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:34,810
sow and you can do that you're entitled
you don't have to be american

9
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,489
and despite my I am american but

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,489
I live here since 2008 and so it's kinda

11
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:45,968
it's fun and I actually I'll give you a
little about history

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,140
kinda like why did I actually get
interested in in this now

13
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:53,329
at there is a talk on the mail with the
same

14
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:57,199
same time all this and amateur radio
original their hobby

15
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,690
embraces talk is much more technical in
nature is much more the

16
00:01:01,690 --> 00:01:06,140
technical introduction to amateur radio
now the content in mind my presentations

17
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,860
all a little bit more the cultural

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,850
nerd ology and i actually make kinda
loose argument as to

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,449
establishing with the advent electricity
in using electricity for communications

20
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:19,549
that was really Genesis above where
you're getting started

21
00:01:19,549 --> 00:01:23,619
so it's a little bit more the Colts will
discussion there will be other talks

22
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,610
little talk about

23
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,270
a amateur radio overall and so he want
to know about

24
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,990
packet radio what nonce you can come see
me we can talk individually

25
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,699
this is more a kind of cultural part
like what does it mean what is

26
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,790
what exactly this is you know
interestingly interestingly enough to

27
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:40,229
embrace

28
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:43,270
have the video talk I also this

29
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,039
and tennis mentor nurses terminology

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,829
in the ham radio above an older guy now
and burping

31
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:55,719
sorry guys a the idea of a mentor

32
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:58,890
somebody kinda guides you through the
process of understanding at this

33
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,680
thats team to beat elmer and the term
Elmer is not use very much in the UK but

34
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,180
a in one the sets classes to learn

35
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:11,580
a amateur radio doctor Bligh Roger he
was really fantastic and really had a

36
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,320
lot of spirit he was a new him

37
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,549
and he didn't necessarily have kind of
some so the cultural hangups I think

38
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,850
some the old guard has

39
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,880
he really brought in some enthusiasm in

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:25,269
the environment and then of course
various people contributed

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,360
into giving me a little bit more empower

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:31,390
and credit history at the new demo have

43
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:35,160
hamming around soul everyone is in there
am

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,790
anybody self-identify as a nerd yeah
stupid weeds

45
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:43,790
it's great guys a young kid you're in
good company and the really really the

46
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:47,070
the basis for this is from I think you
there we keep a year which

47
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:52,220
which in erie I say to all eyesight of
my sources in the comments of you ever

48
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:54,220
wanted to copy this for yourself

49
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,350
for information that way the idea is
that we highly technical

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:02,859
or that we're kinda living a life
fantasy and is lined with fancy might

51
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:04,510
think that it's I for you might think

52
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,590
his head in the clouds also think that
as creating things imagining things

53
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:14,170
what could be not necessarily what
things are and soap sometimes

54
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:17,458
as nerds were kinda mean we're social
outcasts are getting frustrated we're

55
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:17,790
going

56
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:21,650
I hate the world world should be a
better place I wish that the world could

57
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:23,269
change in this direction

58
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:26,410
minutes with the that's the beauty is
governor them because

59
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:30,480
we actually help revolutionize be a help
change the world

60
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,350
we make the world a better place and
it's very strange to see this kind of

61
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:35,440
Romanticism

62
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,859
a have nerds in the media PC Facebook

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,310
a you see that use a facebook me
Facebook movie

64
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,500
you seeing Silicon Valley Holton catch
fire

65
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,580
really kinda strange romanticism in the
media

66
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,280
nerds in a realize that yeah we we do
kinda make the world better it's it's a

67
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,570
it's an interesting thing

68
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:57,959
some that's the idea nerd clients

69
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,090
in the context that this whatsoever to
radio science and radio really

70
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:04,430
this is a lot of words but I'll give you

71
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,480
anything it is people there interested
in the concept

72
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,959
radios that be be playing with
propagation that be

73
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:15,459
that possibly using radio to be able to
control things

74
00:04:15,459 --> 00:04:19,500
to be able to communicate is wont to
different elements at this buttons

75
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,110
kind people are fascinated by this this
is not low power FM

76
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,580
this is not broadcast this is actually
just trying to be

77
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,250
trying to have a conversation with
people at interestingly enough

78
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,960
if you ever feel like you're a bit
antisocial I'll won the great things

79
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,840
you you know were when he really social
creatures but we still

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:43,289
kinda like to have that comfortable
distance amateur radio is great because

81
00:04:43,289 --> 00:04:47,449
we can turn on the radio we can call out
sick you and see if someone's out there

82
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:50,690
the respondent talk with us and then the
beauty in

83
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:53,919
other is that if you've done you know
being social

84
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,409
just turn the radio off and that's
beautiful because

85
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:01,430
work for somebody who has I'm an
outgoing guy and I talk a lot but

86
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,710
I there are times when its nice to say I
just a little bit %uh socializing and

87
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,280
but the room really really the key thing
with amateur radios that you have to go

88
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,809
through a licensing process

89
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,090
in order to curb that improve yourself
and the

90
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,150
early licenses their very reasonable
people can

91
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:23,159
people oftentimes get a license here in
the UK within a week and

92
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:26,530
in the States it's actually self-study
most the time

93
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,549
so often times people cram cram cram
sometimes the night before

94
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,740
and actually get get a license pretty
immediately what licenses are actually

95
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,310
granted

96
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:38,780
through volunteer coordinators volunteer
examine a reason a

97
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:41,830
invigilators here in this country and
they make sure that

98
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:45,930
everybody you know a has the credibility
to hold the license

99
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:48,200
which is fun

100
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,550
alright so what about CB radio everybody
gets I am sorry that slight CB thats

101
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:58,700
breaker breaker 123 rights am not
exactly this is probably

102
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:02,110
into any you can aid in the audience

103
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:07,650
now RXL I sound really enthusiastic so
most times people confuse me for being a

104
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:08,349
Canadian

105
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,840
have many times at the Canadian is tired

106
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,440
or maybe just a little bit further just
depressed when they speak they're

107
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,700
oftentimes confuse for being American

108
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:21,060
and so you go on a man what's life like

109
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:24,610
as an american living here and they will
get very offended

110
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,690
they all say I'm not American and
Canadian

111
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:32,210
and it's very offensive but to to to
american did he say hey man

112
00:06:32,210 --> 00:06:35,479
in a simply positive are you can AT&T

113
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:40,450
no I'm not another the canadian-american
that's okay that's a nice compliment

114
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:41,210
that you gave me

115
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:44,409
similar to CB radio on it like hands

116
00:06:44,410 --> 00:06:47,980
the they've worked so hard to study the
study their tests they

117
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:51,960
city information the really focused on
you know signal propagation and

118
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,900
wavelengths and

119
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:56,690
and 12 then tell us and they got I II

120
00:06:56,690 --> 00:07:00,110
how dare you how dare you confuse me
with CB radio and

121
00:07:00,110 --> 00:07:04,140
really any back in the day before cell
phones CB radio was kinda this

122
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:07,960
wonderful free world but it is
unlicensed at this point

123
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,260
and a lot of people this is this is an
editorial comment but it really attracts

124
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,340
the dregs of society

125
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,549
if you really if you really into a tree
into trucking in prostitution

126
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:22,090

motorway

127
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:26,140
go for it go to town go to CB radio

stop and he and in I would say

140
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,000
no no no no because these guys were
socially valued

141
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,650
they said we like the idea you dreaming
and philosophizing exploring this

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:21,030
unknown world and so we're gonna give
you the respect you deserve

143
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:24,258
so where they nerds now and besides

glasses and pocket protectors and now

145
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:30,699

146
00:08:30,699 --> 00:08:34,990
cell yeah so little bit more contact
contact

147
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:38,330
so marconi I'd like to think that
marconi

148
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:42,010
some are co-lead a his Italian he all he
emigrated

149
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:47,439
route to europe and I want to mention
that he was growing up it may be they

150
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:48,810
said a Marconi

151
00:08:48,810 --> 00:08:52,790
that sounds a lot like macaroni hi drove
him to say

152
00:08:52,790 --> 00:08:56,890
on there must be a better world
somewhere and so he he saw the research

153
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,630
it hurts

154
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:01,270
and he was like wow this is great %ah
what I should do is

155
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:04,819
maybe I can use this electricity and be
able to communicate

156
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:09,709
using a spark gap transmitter was spark
gap transmit it really is

157
00:09:09,709 --> 00:09:13,520
it's this thing it just creates a las
static this

158
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,140
buzz buzz buzz is like turning on your
vacuum cleaner

159
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,770
a and picking it up on your radio
somewhere else it was a spark at

160
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:23,650
transmitters so I actually didn't really
have a tunable dial

161
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:27,670
didn't have any kind of frequency just
through some noise out there and if he

162
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:28,329
used

163
00:09:28,329 --> 00:09:32,120
at Morse code use the Telegraph then you
could actually start

164
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,399
communicate wirelessly now I will I
actually say that

165
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,709
a Guglielmo marconi was the

166
00:09:39,709 --> 00:09:43,310
I would see the grandfather nerd them
and you know of course we couldn't go

167
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:45,060
back in time to see whether he was

168
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:48,939
picked on for his macaroni sounding name
but maybe maybe that was that

169
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:52,430
that was that was enough inspiration
push to go into

170
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:56,270
that so one more thing is he was a band
with pig

171
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:59,939
I mean he he just he's older than with
possible but

172
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,200
I guess there was nobody else to
complain about that sell yeah

173
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,250
but interestingly enough me these guys
all over the world were kind of like wow

174
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,120
this is interesting list are playing
with this

175
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,230
and so they started building their own a
billing on radio equipment billing on

176
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,180
their own stations and by the time

177
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,319
it's not that long you know the first
cross Atlantic communication going

178
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
going into finally having damage to
raise stations

179
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,560
actual book saying hear all these people
participating on

180
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,329
on on the band's and sell I would say
between 1910 and 1930 that was really

181
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,099
the Genesis

182
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:37,660
really the enthusiasm all the homie
where people got into

183
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,110
some this is for camp it everybody knows
who had numerous

184
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,110
now she says she's a beautiful actress
am

185
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:49,880
I shoes very prolific but she actually
contributed

186
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:56,260
to helping win the war and Co invention
is this this frequency hopping spread

187
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,110
spectrum

188
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,740
a concept which really is the beginning

189
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:04,360
what actually enabled us to be able to
use mobile phones because

190
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:08,589
as we use mobile phones were kinda were
bouncing between a strong tower

191
00:11:08,589 --> 00:11:11,940
connecting week 1 and soapy move
somewhere else

192
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,510
we you know we what we move

193
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:17,540
move to that spectrum that that other
towers going to and then were able to

194
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,480
that seemed to work quite well so I
would say the most beautiful

195
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,960
original owner people like this that but

196
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,160
I'll have to see pictures 2 really
that's true

197
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,030
yeah I mean she was she was amazing and
she

198
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:35,660
started exploring this idea and and so
during that time

199
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:40,280
and you can see Kansas evolution Korean
spy cam technology

200
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:44,339
where spar cap was was just throwing a
budget white noise out into the

201
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,730
out the atmosphere in pick it up
somewhere they were kind of going into

202
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:54,030
a little bit more it better oscillations
so very low frequency and low-frequency

203
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:57,900
and high-frequency inward we actually
starting to experiment a little bit

204
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:01,140
with very high frequency communications

205
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,699
cell its cool stuff so

206
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,330
after after the war near

207
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:13,400
the word nerd actually came about came
for me I am

208
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,900
came from a doctor Seuss book and

209
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:20,459
the doctor seuss work it was just
basically this just kinda

210
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:26,270
cc in a ccn gibberish but somebody
actually gl1 that neared word

211
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:31,520
and they went okay I'm going to use that
in lieu in substitution

212
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,180
a the word for square and oftentimes

213
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:38,910
some time square was cool but square
became square

214
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,650
and sell and maybe it's hip to be square
now so I don't know where square is

215
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:43,170
buttered

216
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:48,280
pretty obvious what the idea is is nerds
started

217
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,290
live urging this kind of communication
technology

218
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:54,910
and we were able to get a lot post-war

219
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:58,160
equipment to be able to just just make
stuff

220
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,680
because they weren't you know what more
to wasn't going to come back in theory

221
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:02,219
cell

222
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:06,770
there's all this great stuff to be able
to hack line and see how it works

223
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:10,069
how to make it work cell really really
cool Id &&

224
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,330
this this world actually led she's a
very imp

225
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:16,490
very impressive my invention so all's
don't give me some

226
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:20,600
my favorite nerds that that we dealt
with so steve wozniak

227
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,800
very prolific at him he actually got is
is ham license when he was in sixth

228
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:25,258
grade

229
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:29,360
sour that was probably like 11 years old
there or

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,269
I mean there are stories about people
getting a hand licenses 45 thats really

231
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:34,750
really super aggressive but

232
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,690
you hey if you got got nerd love churned
through your veins it's a it's a great

233
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,240
allied

234
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,279
every knows no English no yeah no

235
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,649
in the he was a cop and Atari and sell

236
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,819
you know they're turning attorney system
he actually worked with

237
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:52,240
Steve Jobs who steve wozniak actually
built some stuff for

238
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,350
for know and so it's is a little bit if

239
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,009
nerd incest in there %uh Robert Moog the
musician the

240
00:13:59,009 --> 00:14:03,060
them who made the move synthesizer you
can you would imagine that the

241
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,649
oscillations the accreting to
radiofrequency

242
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:09,220
would be very similar to the
oscillations the town's you creating

243
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:09,630
honest

244
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:14,170
on a synthesizer so moved was really
really I would imagine that this was

245
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:16,009
very complimentary and got him

246
00:14:16,009 --> 00:14:19,940
thinking alright how do I make this
electric piano make some amazing

247
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,990
Chris parents aid a

248
00:14:22,990 --> 00:14:27,009
any deviant hackers up there there yes
appearances huge

249
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:31,120
he's he's very significant in in terms
the open source community

250
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:35,959
a in addition to that Chris Cairns I
don't know if he

251
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,029
really hates Morse code review just
feels obsolete

252
00:14:39,029 --> 00:14:43,420
but he helped actually take away the
requirement to learn Morse code

253
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:47,779
in the late 90's and now we can just
focus on digital modes

254
00:14:47,779 --> 00:14:52,040
focus on the actual purity and radio
rather than have to learn Morse code in

255
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,139
order to be qualified

256
00:14:53,139 --> 00:14:56,449
couple more jack kilby

257
00:14:56,449 --> 00:14:59,810
this guy invented the the integrated
circuit cell

258
00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:03,339
jack kilby was very significant he
worked with Robert nice in

259
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,259
and his is quite significant couple
britt

260
00:15:07,259 --> 00:15:11,589
British signet as a good Maurice Wilkes
Maurice Wilkes actually

261
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,620
he's the guy how many suffer faltering

262
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:19,380
applicable okay so he is the guy that
actually invented the concept

263
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,239
microcode the concert the subroutines
the concept to

264
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:27,309
a symbolic labels and macros

265
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:30,618
and it's going just is amazing staffer
her the computer science

266
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:34,989
understand you know the what is possible
was really

267
00:15:34,989 --> 00:15:38,379
here and Allan Sherman she was the first
Briton space

268
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:41,239
although the British government really
didn't like her cuz she went to the

269
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:41,819
Russian

270
00:15:41,819 --> 00:15:46,738
space station said that the the the
International Space Station

271
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:50,470
and then a couple have %uh celebrities
they had some inner nerd in them

272
00:15:50,470 --> 00:15:55,459
and so they wanted to kinda release that
interestingly enough Marlon Brando

273
00:15:55,459 --> 00:15:58,508
he was almost a bedraggled

274
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:03,069
by his his celebrity and see if you
actually calling itself Martin sometimes

275
00:16:03,069 --> 00:16:07,579
over-the-air just because and an
actually still brando BR andu

276
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,179
acts up because he was like our guys and
you know

277
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:14,199
I want people to know me for me I don't
want people

278
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:17,889
the seeking me out as a as I think gonna
take another drink

279
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:23,830
hope you don't mind

280
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,050
yes okay

281
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:28,329
and Priscilla at any

282
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:31,930
any Bollywood fans is like the biggest
Bollywood actor and a top action he's

283
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:32,939
also become too

284
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,060
so yeah little little little more

285
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,349
little context as far as like as you
know there's a whole variety

286
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,840
spectrum a nerd them and I I like to
thank you you know something for

287
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,400
everyone

288
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:47,230
in no its not related at the different
hamming for different at different

289
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:47,760
nerding

290
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,819
it's not overly it's not a reference to
import error correction not Robert

291
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,320
hamming

292
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,650
but the idea is that with the prime

293
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:59,199
prime feeling is that we wanna create
some international goodwill we want to

294
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,900
reach out to actually talk to people

295
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:04,839
and so the first time and I a I actually
rocked up on Wimbledon Common

296
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,169
and hines said at Lantana and I set up

297
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,660
set up a better in everything and and I
could hear people talking conversing

298
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,740
and then you know I I heard someone call
out and I respond I was like hey hey

299
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:18,839
you know this is me and belleza real

300
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:22,520
that was thrilled to hear somebody that
I don't know I have no idea I don't know

301
00:17:22,520 --> 00:17:23,329
the background

302
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:26,470
and I'm learning about them you know
what is what is it that you by your

303
00:17:26,470 --> 00:17:27,110
culture

304
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,250
how did anyone's the equipment used to
actually reach me

305
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:33,610
your your thousands of miles away and

306
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:37,860
is quite fun so it's its it's a little
bit more of like a cleaner social

307
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:38,979
network because

308
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,910
people know that they're being exposed
and they're using the call sign so

309
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,770
they're being honest with who they are

310
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:49,310
and and just exploration as a social
integration but

311
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,370
is far as the other things the
expeditions that's the idea that you

312
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:54,260
might go on about

313
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:57,930
and the boat wants to be able to make a
make contact with the different

314
00:17:57,930 --> 00:17:59,300
countries as here in the middle

315
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:03,409
international waters people actually
welcome you onto these yachts

316
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,980
and CEO your hand your your your answer
a deal person

317
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:11,279
you can be our columns percent you can
get free free travel to

318
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:16,419
a Watson exotic locations just by having
this credibility of having a call

319
00:18:16,419 --> 00:18:21,360
and assaying pay I'm willing to come
along there's also to cost up

320
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,500
software defined radio I think that's
super super awesome there's

321
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:27,799
actually gonna be a talk I on suffered a
fine radio

322
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:31,340
and what that really is its at that
we've gotten much we've had chips

323
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:32,428
communication chips

324
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,289
that have become so fast that it can
sample

325
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:40,549
pretty much all the spectrum that we can
listen to and then we can process

326
00:18:40,549 --> 00:18:43,769
the all that spectrum into you know
single channels or what not

327
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:47,010
the citizens really really cool tools
that are coming about

328
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:51,299
this offer to find radio has replaced a
lotta transistors in a lot of the

329
00:18:51,299 --> 00:18:55,860
discrete logic that that's required and
theirs is also too crazy stuff you like

330
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,979
satellite if you wanna

331
00:18:56,980 --> 00:19:01,830
if you wanna bounce signals of the Moon
I mean Kaminey if you're doing D&D in

332
00:19:01,830 --> 00:19:02,168
your

333
00:19:02,169 --> 00:19:05,360
you're stuck between you know the person
he is

334
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,360
his first to roll the die I is is

335
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:12,279
out out have an early break you know we
we call to say hey you know I've

336
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:13,340
communicated using

337
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:17,049
you know bounce a single supplement its
third credibility right there

338
00:19:17,049 --> 00:19:20,399
cell this one there's lotsa fun stuff so
this

339
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:23,739
is this something for everybody hand

340
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:27,090
you know really what's what's the modern
world I mean why are we doing this

341
00:19:27,090 --> 00:19:30,860
and interestingly enough work for
clinton this modern air modern world

342
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:33,990
tinkering kinda exploring things to

343
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,240
that's really build things again I think
that probably

344
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,799
a maybe 1995 to May 2005 was kinda dark
time to be a tinkerer

345
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,769
3d really didn't have these platforms
tools and now this is really kind

346
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:51,450
commonality pupils are you know France
reply all these networks only school

347
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,750
stuff people are hacking on quad copters

348
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,450
throwing all sorts of mentation to
create their own drones and what not its

349
00:19:57,450 --> 00:20:00,919
its cool we are living in this new world
and

350
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,440
really this tinkering mindset is the
same thing

351
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:08,620
is what the old guys no years and years
and years ago what we're doing with the

352
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:09,639
real

353
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,690
it's just that we have so many more
things to play with so this is very much

354
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:13,710
a

355
00:20:13,710 --> 00:20:17,930
a augmentation the existing call up the

356
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:21,100
the culture that that here today one
thing

357
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:24,929
that I have to emphasize as well so
communication should be free minute the

358
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:27,110
paper an internet connection in order to
communicate

359
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:31,370
and have international well we don't
have to do that

360
00:20:31,370 --> 00:20:36,129
you know the the airwaves RR and if we
don't use the airwaves ourselves

361
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:39,300
then going to lose out you know the
government will say

362
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:43,220
okay you know these amateurs they're not
playing with the spectrum

363
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:47,340
this is you know we a lot all the specs
spectrum for them but we're not going to

364
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,720
we don't see them using it you don't see
them exercising their license

365
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,500
and they will they will take it away
they will give it to the highest bidder

366
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,830
they will give it to vote upon they will
give it to

367
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,530
to Telefonica o2 hands we will have to
cry

368
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:03,830
in our new de beers somewhere else will
cry it

369
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,290
I'll be terrible all the salt from the
tears burning up the circuits on the

370
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:08,080
Raspberry Pi

371
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,370
system or at me don't go there

372
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:15,820
but I i think that they're actually a in
carrying a resurgence

373
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:20,360
and they aren't public there aren't
really recent numbers in terms of have

374
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,590
people getting their licenses a in the
UK but in the US it's actually gone

375
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:28,199
up again and I think that's good we can
explore stuff we're gonna have fun with

376
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:28,740
that I'm

377
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:33,110
are so if you're curious if you if you
want to

378
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,209
if you want to learn know little bit
more we have an amateur

379
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:39,800
redial village which is nearby we're
gonna have a giant mass

380
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,190
but the showing NASCAR fell apart the
last well

381
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:47,520
at least it wasn't on the motorway but
it fell apart in celiac

382
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,970
we don't have a giant mass will be
pretty obvious will have a fair amount

383
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:50,830
in tennis

384
00:21:50,830 --> 00:21:53,919
but yeah an icon over we'll chat and

385
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,180
we actually happened II festival station

386
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:01,080
called GV to Yuma and if you want to
listen in

387
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:05,320
or or or suggest you know a you know ask
this question is that we're even play

388
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,760
around with the dials a little bit

389
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,700
obviously World War happy to share with
the

390
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:14,120
experience so come on over I would love
to share with us a

391
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:17,419
hey this is the cool stuff now okay so
if you're

392
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:20,630
one another wat you what are the types
owners that is II

393
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:24,960
you like on AIM to shine and to show it
to actually go up and ask about

394
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,500
am sorry I watch them but I don't want
to I wanna touch anything

395
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:32,500
as I get my video instead instead that
you can actually explore this

396
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,250
from you from your laptop just go to web
STR

397
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:40,710
dot word and I'm I add to favorites is
one in

398
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:44,310
University have 20 in in the Netherlands

399
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:47,440
the other is is hack green which is

400
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,060
in the north the UK and I like clicking
on that because

401
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,100
hi it is basically a software-defined
radio

402
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:58,429
but has a Wed interface you can actually
see the Spectrum's

403
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,090
and very interestingly enough you can
actually you know you can see the

404
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:02,240
waveforms you can go

405
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:06,980
oh okay thats points you see the on of
waveforms all that's going to be

406
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:10,840
Morse code you can actually go in and
click you can see the beautiful

407
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,379
waterfall images and its

408
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:15,640
it's really quite exciting because you
know if you're listening to that

409
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:18,730
you listen you'll hear call sign you go
like mmm I

410
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:22,300
18 that call if that person actually has
a website you know getting a little more

411
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,419
background and sell

412
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:27,820
if you heard me talking and I was using
had to act too easy rar1s

413
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:31,520
you could look at on the Internet just
on Google 20 ans

414
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,530
you'll see my little bio and you'll see
little deliver information about me

415
00:23:35,530 --> 00:23:39,450
so you might be hearing my voice you
also know a little bit more about why I

416
00:23:39,450 --> 00:23:39,840
am

417
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,260
behind-the-scenes and oftentimes other
hand still have the curve

418
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:47,410
their computers nearby song all call up
it'll say hello hello

419
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:51,200
and talk to them and I'll go hey that's
a beautiful cat the haver

420
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:55,840
oh hey this is this is really fun and I
use the cat image because that was that

421
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,539
that was on my

422
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:00,440
QR said profiles yep

423
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,259
any am I can we have a little bit I'm

424
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:07,389
a does everyone here but

425
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:11,769
ham stereotypes is always nerd
stereotypes a writer I okay okay on

426
00:24:11,769 --> 00:24:13,340
forget that no collected

427
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,999
questions I I kinda I can I love just
kinda the humor

428
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:21,149
stereotypes like I work within the IT
industry and there's a stereotype that

429
00:24:21,149 --> 00:24:22,758
most ABA's assholes

430
00:24:22,759 --> 00:24:28,190
and sell it said ABBA I make he ate some
stairs

431
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:33,639
really fun so I yeah the VA's usually
just raise their hand slow

432
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:36,889
and so okay yeah near hammered by this
time

433
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:40,109
ok and the reason why they call him is
because they were professional radio

434
00:24:40,109 --> 00:24:40,889
operators

435
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:45,330
and thats at work insulted that they
were in fees yes

436
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:48,350
Ovi radio so they were like 0

437
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:53,059
these guys just ham radio guys and a ham
radio guys they were like

438
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:56,549
I mean maybe they were insulted for a
little while but the Navy appropriated

439
00:24:56,549 --> 00:24:57,139
the term

440
00:24:57,139 --> 00:25:00,779
so it you could think of it as nerd
pride or HAMP right saying

441
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:03,989
I am am how dare you ok

442
00:25:03,989 --> 00:25:07,139
are tell so be the cultural stereotypes
here

443
00:25:07,139 --> 00:25:10,639
200 Russian wats so to russia wants is

444
00:25:10,639 --> 00:25:14,479
is really really gets back to this this
this idea of when you have a license

445
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:18,440
you on a limitation how much power the
you can pump into the atmosphere

446
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:23,350
and the Russian limitation was 200 watts
but interestingly enough after

447
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:27,248
you know various wars and and police
actions and what not within russia

448
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:30,549
the he had a lot of amplifier equipment
and

449
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:33,730
russia's huge country so they do want to
pump out

450
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:37,139
a lot of power in order to communicate
with people all over the world so

451
00:25:37,139 --> 00:25:40,539
at mostly ham radio ours mostly amateur
radio

452
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:44,220
regulators they were also hymns and so
they would have

453
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:48,190
you know they would show their their
there

454
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:50,610
may be sure the amplifiers they would
say 200 watt

455
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,070
really was probably ten times that south
2000 watts and

456
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:57,499
yeah you know if your if you're lonely
in siberia you pumping out he doesn't

457
00:25:57,499 --> 00:25:59,519
want to be able to communicate and talk
with people

458
00:25:59,519 --> 00:26:02,980
that's cool yeah I any a we have one

459
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,499
at least one Italian here any other
Italians yet now just alright so we've

460
00:26:07,499 --> 00:26:08,759
got one time here

461
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:13,110
there's a stereotype amongst at least
European amongst European operators

462
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:17,279
italians also do not respect the wattage
limitation

463
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,240
cell when you're and it's very
interesting as

464
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,259
more more you know my a rowdy a matter i
do.

465
00:26:24,259 --> 00:26:28,029
it's just its and very interestingly
enough your your

466
00:26:28,029 --> 00:26:33,669
you actually see that rightness signal
on the STRs if you going on with STR

467
00:26:33,669 --> 00:26:36,899
are you you see you know like normal
kinda purple EE

468
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:40,340
images many see something that's like
white-hot when you click on that

469
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:45,279
it's going to be an Italian accent speak
just it's just think again

470
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:50,039
a in addition to that and there's the
sack competitions is really a sport

471
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,249
competitions where people are

472
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:54,369
trying to make as many connections as
possible

473
00:26:54,369 --> 00:26:58,139
and oftentimes italians they won't
follow the rules

474
00:26:58,139 --> 00:27:01,789
do whatever they want and interestingly
trying to pick on me

475
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:05,429
take on the land here but cubans also

476
00:27:05,429 --> 00:27:09,190
II the they have a signal but it's all
oftentimes over modulated

477
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:12,559
so what it is instead of having this
amount a pan with you basically just

478
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,879
splattering across lots and lots of
frequencies in

479
00:27:15,879 --> 00:27:19,189
and people in the US were East Coast the

480
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:22,970
a they'll the look at their spectrum
enough to allow its cubans again

481
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:27,570
cell it's kinda crazy I'm Japanese very
courteous

482
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:31,049
very very courteous kinda like Al yes
hello that

483
00:27:31,049 --> 00:27:34,860
to interestingly enough they're the most
license they have on

484
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:39,419
there they have 1.3 million licensees

485
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:42,760
which is all which is a lot and and
that's actually kinda symbolic

486
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,030
are the fact that the majority a radios
high-quality radios

487
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,610
a Japanese you're starting the season
Chinese kinda

488
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:54,040
stuff popping up my radio is a super
cheap 32

489
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:57,200
quid handheld radio that Chinese but

490
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:00,570
and Japanese are still very enthusiastic
yeah

491
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:03,830
so I talked about going to drop you guys
you know these guys

492
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:06,810
hand to go through Morse code not
because they like it because they had to

493
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:08,190
do in order to get a license

494
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:11,430
so there they're kinda this this kind is
some

495
00:28:11,430 --> 00:28:14,640
technical ham butthurt about at

496
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,820
a me you know what you know no more
scarves

497
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:22,790
you don't know day and did and didn't
are are the two

498
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:26,610
you know the the short long towns and
Morse code cell they're just right I

499
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:27,000
mean

500
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:31,070
everybody likes a little fiefdom and so
if somebody's coming in

501
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,560
and changing the game you know have
their you remix my own the song or

502
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:36,790
something like that

503
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:40,700
this is people just not adapting change
and

504
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:44,130
yeah also is all people holy crap
there's a

505
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,400
this whole band called meters it's about
3500 4000

506
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,900
killer its as usually just all guys just
on a pair yeah I was in the garden

507
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,090
and

508
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:58,060
the fence fell down and

509
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:01,169
so these old guys are just you know
they're just getting

510
00:29:01,170 --> 00:29:06,220
to sorry so in some people GOP as
transmitting on the back pain our

511
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:09,290
a we talking about your you visit with
the

512
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,879
with the GP and yeah how ya

513
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,190
yeah so so my boss I actually came out
of the closet

514
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:19,890
as a as an amateur radio enthusiasts to
my boss and my boss said

515
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:23,540
he's German so I could may be simulated
voice but he said the

516
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:26,909
per seat per se I ran into him and he
said yes naw

517
00:29:26,910 --> 00:29:30,050
and I'm like no shit that I offend him

518
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,629
you know it amateur radio and heated by
no actually

519
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:37,460
II am world radio sport champion

520
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,820
was like wow well sweet a

521
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:43,970
maybe you've made a contact with my
uncle he does as well

522
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:48,690
and interestingly enough these guys are
very passionate about racking up the

523
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,280
points

524
00:29:49,280 --> 00:29:53,300
based upon you know how will that how
much is an exotic locale that they've

525
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,419
made a connection with

526
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:57,640
how many connections that the Macon
forty-eight hours he's got some sleep

527
00:29:57,640 --> 00:29:58,930
during the contest thing

528
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:02,790
but to the other hand center just want
to talk about back pain and just

529
00:30:02,790 --> 00:30:06,050
Canada chill out and say hey you know
what color

530
00:30:06,050 --> 00:30:09,510
do you have any dogs or other pets

531
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:12,790
you know these guys these guys are all
offended because they like

532
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:16,350
the contest just trying to make as many
contacts as possible

533
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:19,909
and they're not even the nineteen
socializing are so there's there's a

534
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,830
little bit a

535
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:24,800
a there's a little bit on bridge between
different cultures but really they're

536
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,690
they're kinda the jocks the band because
really competing against

537
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:31,270
you know I gotta make these all these
points and what not and and

538
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:35,150
strangely enough I used to work for a
company whose at with the CEO was a

539
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,530
World Race for champions

540
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:41,340
our I and he's kinda jockeys have yeah

541
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:45,810
and then it finally hi this are actually
really positive ATPases stereotype that

542
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:46,260
women

543
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,040
operators are typically very very good
and I don't know if it's just because

544
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:51,780
it's so male-dominated

545
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,830
all eyes on the girls but a all

546
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,270
the contacts all the q-cells that I have
heard

547
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:02,129
have very articulate there and maybe
it's because his

548
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:06,210
the maybe the tone is a little higher
sis so super super clear

549
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:09,310
very very nice so it's actually very
positive stereotypes

550
00:31:09,310 --> 00:31:12,379
had to have women him since our a you
know

551
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,520
come on in the waters fine if you want
to want to explore that

552
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,810
am yeah I'll among full-time but

553
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:22,770
I think that we have a little time for
questions so send me any questions

554
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,350
set to no hola look around with the

555
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,780
with a microphone desperate to a
technical questions you know I and under

556
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:30,930
the influence our

557
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:34,170

559
00:31:37,530 --> 00:31:40,910
where the radios was like where's the
village yeah on

560
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:44,550
I think it is that away but I got here
about

561
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:48,110
a forty minutes ago so I actually
haven't had a chance to go to

562
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,490
the amateur radio but the team if you
follow me around
