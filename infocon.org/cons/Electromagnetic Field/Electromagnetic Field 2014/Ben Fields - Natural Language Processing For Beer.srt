1
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:15,039
home hello I it's been out I'm so I miss
thomas Hawk in just a second but i just

2
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:16,099
want to let everyone know

3
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:19,419
in light of the fact that the contrast
on the projectors for the

4
00:00:19,419 --> 00:00:22,779
a bit week I'm I uploaded the slides

5
00:00:22,779 --> 00:00:25,240
so if you want to call them onto your
own laptop and you can stare at them

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:26,209
right from your face

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:30,189
but that might be helpful it said a bit
leaving slash

8
00:00:30,189 --> 00:00:33,540
capital and capital L capital P the
number four

9
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,339
beer NLP for beer and and then you can
pull the slide then and you don't have

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:40,629
to deal with the screen

11
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,410
its badly pite dot allright slash

12
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:47,968
capital and capital at all capital P

13
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,629
the number four beer in Be'er

14
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:58,629
and had beers all lower case I canopy
and everybody who want to get it yeah

15
00:00:59,269 --> 00:01:02,440
cool coming in are I'm the you

16
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,350
yeah it's it's been the slash NLP and
that capitalized

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,110
for a number for and then lower case
Be'er

18
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:19,110
NLP pour beer

19
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,360
the me

20
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,960
because I'm gonna get started by telling
you all a little bit about the things

21
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,119
that that keep me up at night I'm so

22
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,330
to name it on screen right now or
perhaps on your laptop if you grab the

23
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,470
slides I

24
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,280
is is really the sort of summary of my
nightmare of existence right to have a

25
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,670
lovely bar

26
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,800
with lotsa beer on offer and almost no
quick an easily accessible information

27
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,570
about what any of those beers might
taste like

28
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:12,340
right so so in this is a really common
certain information display in a bar in

29
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,010
England

30
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,630
you have a bunch of sort of commercially

31
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:20,109
sensible cask i-label Sal

32
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:23,890
that's on the pumps and maybe some
Brandyn on top

33
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,739
a a draft hump and that's that's all the
information you get so

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,060
I don't know this one's purple it's got
a nice how America fun what does it

35
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,640
taste like I have no idea

36
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,339
right so so here I am I got like 30
beers in front of me only so much

37
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:38,560
alcohol I can shove my liver and night

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,590
and and I have to make a choice between
all these things and I have no long-term

39
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:47,000
Asian to make that choice with or no no
practical information to get ready

40
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,500
right so unrecognized thus far it's
lovely thing Clerkenwell

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:54,010
and so this is this is my dream this is
from a un

42
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:58,269
unfortunate now to business I bar
Commission Taylor

43
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,010
this is their paper menu and it is it is
a lovely piece

44
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:07,000
%uh above text information about beer so
so just really quickly cancer go through

45
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,070
things and you see

46
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:11,850
they've got their organize things by
broad colored which the really good way

47
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:13,420
to start with the organization

48
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:16,649
and then inside each description

49
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:19,459
which made you can make out on the
projector but invited description you

50
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:19,930
have

51
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:25,580
a couple a sentence bit roughly walk you
through what kind of Labor's you expect

52
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:29,030
how strong it is in taste what the
future course

53
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:33,930
and how much it costs um and this this
menu is quite quick to parse you can

54
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:36,019
even do it when you've had a few beers
already

55
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,330
you can probably work how what's meant
to be going on this sort of thing and

56
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,690
so

57
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:45,320
really what I want to do is talk about
ways that we might be able to move

58
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,500
from this or current state of affairs
automatically to a menu that kinda looks

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,590
like what we just saw right ways that we
can harvested the broader

60
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,660
intellect of the universe on the web to
make

61
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,940
good facts about beer that are well
organized and easily accessible

62
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,900
United dream so so they're going to have
a talk called

63
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,930
taste great less wordy I ever did
document at rolling across the morning

64
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,560
to prepare

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,630
mine has been fields and

66
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:19,070
I work for the company called on
possible solutions and I'm camping right

67
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:20,510
over there for the next few days

68
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,240
so this talk really is about two
different things

69
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:29,200
and the first courses beer lots and lots
of beer

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,820
shelves and shelves a beer ideally how
you deal with it how you think about it

71
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,980
and and how it works and the second

72
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:44,740
is is text and not just text for the
organization of text any organization

73
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:50,050
I've big work subtext so sell em and
merge the two things together and we end

74
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:51,730
up affecting the talking about be
reviews

75
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,850
I'm and and it's worth pointing out that

76
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:58,500
everything that we're gonna talk about
today can be generalized to other topics

77
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,320
so

78
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,020
the things that we are arsov talking
about specifically with beer of course

79
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,289
can generalize to other

80
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,240
other beverages but more than that
basically anything that people write

81
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:08,750
about

82
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:11,690
when they write descriptions about items
you can do the kind of stuff we're

83
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:12,370
talking about

84
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:15,830
to those large disk stacks and
descriptions of items and get

85
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:19,609
somewhere to where we're going right on

86
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,470
and all the a bit this or text
processing techniques

87
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:26,830
actually they'd generalize beyond taxes
well so you can

88
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:29,990
find people who do the kinds of things
that were going to text

89
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:33,360
to any streams have bites so anything
you can chalk up

90
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,940
and call those chunks characters and
words you can actually do a lot of the

91
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:38,219
stuff that we're going to be doing

92
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,380
to text as such people do it audio and
video sometimes in the FX urs strange

93
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,060
and interesting

94
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:47,860
and so do anything it's worth noting and
then we're done with the caveat

95
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:51,479
is that the talks really informal so if
there are any academics on these topics

96
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,740
in the audience like we talk about the
details are

97
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,979
stats afterwards but for the sake of
sort of brevity and getting through

98
00:05:57,979 --> 00:05:58,780
things and being

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,440
able to follow everything I'm gonna skim
over a lot of the math in a way that's

100
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,210
approximately wrong but is still
high-level follow bomb

101
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,419
so let's talk about beer so

102
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:16,960
beer is made up of four things and maybe
some additives for relief or things

103
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,830
the first is water water is
extraordinarily important with beer

104
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:24,580
the mineral content in the water has a
huge effect on what sort of beer you can

105
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,710
get what so how

106
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,539
different flavors will work most have
your beer is water

107
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:33,680
the sickening in malt some old is a
cereal grain

108
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,060
it also used to make with keep I and and
really this is where I love the

109
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:41,849
alcohol which comes from sugar comes
from the malt

110
00:06:41,849 --> 00:06:45,050
and you can use by the mall most
commonly you can also use

111
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:48,289
raw I and we and oats basically anything
the

112
00:06:48,289 --> 00:06:51,409
there is a cereal grain you can turn
into beer and you have to multi

113
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:54,690
Hass Hass are the

114
00:06:54,690 --> 00:06:58,300
heard that makes your beer a little
better

115
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:01,860
and anything that isn't sweet probably
came from the hops

116
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,810
are unless the flavored beer with an
additive hot 100 varieties

117
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,180
and the particular kind other part of
the heart that matters is the flowers

118
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,270
such as the female hops that we get
these things from

119
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:19,070
and yeah and then of course least so
used to the single cell organism it is

120
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,530
magic is completely magic so you give

121
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:25,008
a sugar solution to this yeast and it
turns into alcohol

122
00:07:25,009 --> 00:07:29,469
it's wonderful human society depends on
this first domesticated animals

123
00:07:29,469 --> 00:07:32,500
youth so

124
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,560
with those four things you go through a
four-stage process you mash so mashallah

125
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,139
in the audience ever made porridge

126
00:07:39,139 --> 00:07:42,500
anybody may porch anybody hands hands
okay so

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,590
so that's that's that matching writes
all you do you take your cereal grains

128
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:50,068
mall mostly from barley and you so good
in

129
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:53,759
hot water and the temperature use
matters but word don't matter too much

130
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,229
and well you soak those grains in water

131
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:00,719
you activate and chemical processes that
turn starch into sugar

132
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,779
and you have to do that because you used
can eat sugar body can eat starch

133
00:08:04,779 --> 00:08:06,870
you want alcohol and to have to feed you

134
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:11,130
least so you mash it and then after
you've mastered you boil it for an hour

135
00:08:11,130 --> 00:08:13,120
maybe you don't have to pay on their
style

136
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,820
and while you're bowling a achieving a
few things the first thing is that your

137
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,830
knocking out a buncha proteins that'll
make your beer not cases nice and not

138
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,440
keep as well and the little cloudy
knowing what cloudy here

139
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,780
and the only thing that boiling let you
do is it gets off some the water so the

140
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:28,929
AB you go up a little bit

141
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:32,500
I and Axis readings and you needed to

142
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:36,179
get the hops well integrated into the
beer there's a few things about the way

143
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,349
the bitterness happens chemically that
require

144
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:41,810
a good hard boil and sound yeah

145
00:08:41,809 --> 00:08:44,920
and then you do for men so for men is
where the East goes to town

146
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,370
so once you've made a sorta really sweet
slightly better solution with

147
00:08:49,370 --> 00:08:52,740
harps and your boiled syrup

148
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,800
from malt you throw 100 Houston it and
these teeth all the sugar

149
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,260
and boils up quite nicely as you can see
in the picture maybe and move more

150
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,439
current and

151
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,100
and I slept that that's the phone these
makes because you see children produces

152
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:07,180
co2 alcohol and so the co2 make some

153
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,780
many package it and the packaging

154
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:14,420
in this case is bottles also you can
package a beer

155
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,569
in a cast in a CAG in a can all kinds
ways

156
00:09:18,570 --> 00:09:22,310
I sometimes there's a combination that
happens in the packaging

157
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:25,770
as it happens the cask ale it also
happens with

158
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:29,310
I bottle conditioned beer so that that
bottle conditioning

159
00:09:29,310 --> 00:09:32,520
it means that the combination actually
happens via

160
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,040
the process to the east continuing

161
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:40,829
while its in the bottle you can also
forced her into beer which he just shot

162
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,690
a bunch of

163
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:45,920
co2 from a canister into the liquid and
then put in a can or bottle

164
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
okay so that's it so that's

165
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,580
that's four ingredients and four steps

166
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:56,360
and you get just about every beer the
you can think of I think just about

167
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:57,330
because if there's

168
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,610
their sometimes there are for dad lives
how is that weird things

169
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:04,430
summers their industrial processes that
have lives but generally up for most

170
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:05,680
fear most of the time

171
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,359
for things four steps at it so

172
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,890
that creates a extremely diverse range I
love

173
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:16,290
beers and there is a set of people in
the world

174
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:19,829
that like nothing else than to sit
around on the weekend and taste them

175
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:22,560
and bicker with each other I which one
taste better and which one case a

176
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:25,550
grapefruit and we twenty-some leather
and which one takes an elder flowers

177
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:29,269
here's a picture of up one of these
lovely songs I I count myself among

178
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:30,220
their number frequently

179
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:34,490
I'm so the thing about these people

180
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,560
a is that we have some web sites where
we can

181
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,979
said collect our opinions and then this
isn't one of them it's rape you don't

182
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,000
come to my readers quite a good one as a
few others though also I'm not

183
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,920
necessarily advocating for repair over
all the other ones but their website

184
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,920
quite easy to scrape

185
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,089
betrays a handy for the latter part of
the top on

186
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,700
I really has been around for a long time
and

187
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,120
there's quite a lot so the first thing
to mention is that rate Pierce

188
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,680
aesthetic hasn't really changed since
2001 so it looks like a website from

189
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:05,130
whence to come switches

190
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,899
yes this nice is quite so maybe tell you
a few things about every day you get a

191
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:11,079
basic meditator

192
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:14,189
now but you can hear see here for punk
IPA

193
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:17,279
yeah BrewDog circor core hotmail

194
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:22,140
CC the ABC have the beer you can see
where the brewery is located what style

195
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:22,740
it is

196
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,490
and then a sort of nominal idea how

197
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:29,490
good it is according to the community
and the way they express things

198
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,540
rather than using ratings it was her
percentile score

199
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,029
and you'll see two percentile scores for
any the beers andre-pierre one of them

200
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:38,220
is an overall across all beers in the
site

201
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,730
and the other one is style normalized
and the Cylon allies won

202
00:11:41,730 --> 00:11:46,880
can be more useful for anything that's
not really over half the IPA's because

203
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,149
that's kind of what rate beer

204
00:11:48,149 --> 00:11:52,020
likes so if you have beer that is I

205
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:56,290
simpler were darker or a little easier
on the palate

206
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,899
the community Arabia tend to not like it
as much and so what you'll find is you

207
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:02,589
get beers and actually one of the ones

208
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,860
on the bar is one of these that rates
really highly in its style and still not

209
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,250
very highly across all the beer right so

210
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:14,529
be aware style by so did his cool down
on a review page when you see

211
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,930
is this lovely collection of ivory views
and to hear

212
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:22,069
here we have 4 I'm for punk IPA

213
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:27,519
a bunch I love 100 to 200 character
review southern can get quite long

214
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,759
that explain the beer and that also I

215
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,589
split up people's numeric opinions
quantified opinions into you

216
00:12:34,589 --> 00:12:37,990
a much different dimensions so our room
appearance

217
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:42,829
taste of you on the palate an overall
score you get a date you get the

218
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:44,269
location of the user

219
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:48,100
and then too much text so here we have

220
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,930
for funk AP a clear medium to dark
yellow-orange color with a large from

221
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,699
feed to creamy good lacy

222
00:12:54,699 --> 00:12:59,990
mostly to fully tastin her are most
people laughing off-white head Rami is

223
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,990
moderate multi Carmel moderate to heavy
hoppy

224
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,829
citrus dusty grass orange citrus

225
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:11,979
an eccentric goes on from there so and
you get a lot of quite specific

226
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:15,500
flavor characteristics that can be quite
useful and so how it's presented in

227
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,130
things like this

228
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:19,519
so I'm just another example that's

229
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:23,009
a different style so this is a colonel
beer from London

230
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:26,029
the export stout was quite a large dark
beer

231
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,360
I'm also score quite highly amongst the
community

232
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,569
and so this beer if we go down to the
bottom with the

233
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:36,939
this one I trickle I could this case
thick

234
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:39,980
a dark brown or black beer with the
cream brown head

235
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,810
can't think of much to improve here
bitter and sweet and mineral all in one

236
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:44,959
perfect harmony writer

237
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,540
that reviewer clearly loved the spear
and gave some detail about why

238
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,899
and also I got a 4.2 out of 5 see
understand how

239
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:55,930
but sort of critical expectations are
the community

240
00:13:55,930 --> 00:14:02,258
so this slide you may have amir is just
the text from some reviews on that

241
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,160
exports tap

242
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,790
and in fact to be a bit more exact

243
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,849
this is a all of the text from all other
reviews for that exports tap so you

244
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:11,980
probably can't make it out

245
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:16,689
I can make it happen in stages about
75,000 characters

246
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,309
I as I seventy thousand words on

247
00:14:20,309 --> 00:14:23,669
and so but the question is if you use a
site like this

248
00:14:23,669 --> 00:14:28,359
how can you get a good feel for what the
community thinks about a beer

249
00:14:28,359 --> 00:14:32,119
and what i can. what the descriptive
characteristics are that beer

250
00:14:32,119 --> 00:14:35,809
without reading pages and pages the text
right

251
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:39,779
I mean you can sort it do some sampling
re a few reviews here in there but

252
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:44,229
that's not very satisfying and it may
also be the wrong opinion right I'm

253
00:14:44,229 --> 00:14:47,589
so lotsa people

254
00:14:47,589 --> 00:14:50,589
lilac right lot of things about beer and
we want to get a good

255
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:55,789
high-level view up all those things so
we can use textplus thing to do that

256
00:14:55,789 --> 00:14:59,899
and specifically for use AP perfect
crossing call natural language

257
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:00,929
processing NLP

258
00:15:00,929 --> 00:15:04,759
it has no relation to the technique for
understanding

259
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:09,239
and defining human insight the became
quite hip amongst corporate folks in the

260
00:15:09,239 --> 00:15:10,679
eighties they stole our acronym

261
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:13,919
we want it back on natural language
processing

262
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:17,289
and and what that means the people are
speaking as they would

263
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:20,709
and we are trying to get the computer to
understand that or at least to have a

264
00:15:20,709 --> 00:15:23,738
good nap statistical model that it feels
like it understands it

265
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:26,329
in fact most the time actually what
happens because the computers are not

266
00:15:26,329 --> 00:15:28,410
conscious and they're not going to rise
up and kill us

267
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:33,519
at least not yet so on we're going to
summarize documents and document

268
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:34,649
includes here because

269
00:15:34,649 --> 00:15:39,289
a document is just the thing that we
declare is somehow related

270
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:42,989
right so that's part of a sort of
external labeling process this context

271
00:15:42,989 --> 00:15:43,519
here

272
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,919
is related and we will treat it as a
single unit and so we want to summarize

273
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:53,279
documents and want to be able to compare
the documents amongst themselves so

274
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,699
the first thing with naturally across
think that's worth understanding and

275
00:15:56,699 --> 00:15:59,019
where a lot of domain-specific stuff
comes in

276
00:15:59,019 --> 00:16:03,569
is that you have to preprocessor the
clean up all your data so

277
00:16:03,569 --> 00:16:06,649
the colour step here is what cult
organization

278
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:09,879
television is a really fancy academic
word for split on white space

279
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:13,899
right I'm so so here's some Python code

280
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:17,479
the dust organization in the stupidest
way possible are

281
00:16:17,479 --> 00:16:20,769
so we're doing we learn all the words
were spoken on white space

282
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:24,669
hopefully anything permitting or the
like can do this I'm

283
00:16:24,669 --> 00:16:28,249
there are other more exotic ways to do

284
00:16:28,249 --> 00:16:31,610
tokenization I should say you can you
can be

285
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:35,620
really really specific about it so you
can split for instance contractions

286
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:38,750
you can drop punctuation you can ignore
words

287
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:41,920
you can do all kinds of fun things with
your character sets but the simplest and

288
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:44,819
most report based just on MySpace and
take every individual word

289
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:49,140
as a unique token I'm so

290
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:54,000
are you can you talk a in Python called
LTK the slightly more

291
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,980
I exact tokenization besides his wife is
putting

292
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:03,170
with as I say punctuation spelling and I
removing

293
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:09,569
contractions and things like this on I'm
and so than anything you can do in a pre

294
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,339
processes you can declare a bunch of
words that may be common but our

295
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:16,918
for the particular purposes of your
language processing

296
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:21,160
not actually relevant and are never
going to be and this

297
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:25,059
in language processing is called stock
lists are stoppard list

298
00:17:25,059 --> 00:17:29,580
and so a Frankish a you can do things
like put line

299
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:34,520
and then are and I and he and she and we
any and things like this

300
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:38,129
and it does depend on what you're doing
you have to be careful with stopper less

301
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,400
because if you just sort of

302
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,010
throw a big mister words they don't
think are relevant on you can miss

303
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,200
some subtleties in the statistical model
but

304
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:49,270
it's quite good at four adjoining terms

305
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,049
and pronouns and things like this when
you're looking for descriptive text fine

306
00:17:54,049 --> 00:17:58,540
so we'd love that and then we can also
as a last step for our particular

307
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:03,049
adventure basically do part of speech
label in which is another fun trick and

308
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:06,730
eyes a little more complicated South
outside the school is tough but were

309
00:18:06,730 --> 00:18:11,900
I the code in the slide shows how you
can do part especially billion with

310
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:15,700
I the language processing toolkit in
Python and then you can just filter out

311
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,750
everything but adjectives and nouns and
because

312
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:21,410
worthy of a goal here is to get are
listed descriptors

313
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:25,970
for each beer we don't actually care
about nouns

314
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:30,650
or pronouns or past participles or other
part a speechwriter

315
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,130
additives and men's so fine

316
00:18:34,130 --> 00:18:37,780
okay so the person with the most
straightforward if thats

317
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:40,850
this tomorrow so we can use is called TF
idea

318
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:43,300
and TF idea is

319
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:47,090
itself describing which is quite nice so
term frequency

320
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,370
by inverse document frequency and so you
can't

321
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:53,729
in two ways all your tokens first you
count how often

322
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:57,740
a given token occurs in one document as
term frequency

323
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,770
and then you count in how many documents

324
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:04,770
that term a curse and that's docking for
going to be in person that you multiply

325
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,360
them together

326
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,240
so the idea here is that a word that's
very common

327
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:13,690
even if it occurs many times in a
document still get a very high weight

328
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:14,220
cell

329
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:18,410
if you have a word like da and near
corpus is english-language documents

330
00:19:18,410 --> 00:19:22,290
then-vice gonna probably occur in just
about every single one other documents

331
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,570
so even if it occurs many many many
times

332
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,780
in a single documents don't score behind
right on the other hand if you have a

333
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,760
word like

334
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:33,060
I don't know I am brown

335
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,010
or barley or grass or something

336
00:19:37,010 --> 00:19:40,330
that is maybe not so common across a
whole corpus it's only an

337
00:19:40,330 --> 00:19:43,389
a selection of documents but in this one
document for review

338
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:47,410
it occurs hundreds and hundreds of times
well then that documents probably talkin

339
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:51,370
about Press so

340
00:19:51,370 --> 00:19:54,840
to put it all together in a standard for
workflow we takin

341
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,990
a document from the web a buncha reviews
about

342
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,520
beer and be preprocessed them and then
we count the term frequencies

343
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,220
per document and we can't the document
frequency across all the documents

344
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:09,540
and then we get the FIDs course for all
%uh

345
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:13,520
are beers so let's walk for example real
quick

346
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:17,360
so here's a colonel experts doubt you
may recognize at Merlion the talk

347
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,919
here's a picture report some nice nice
head good

348
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:25,250
us he's all the texts you also may
recall from earlier

349
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:31,110
so want me push it through our entire
process along with the whole corpus wind

350
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:31,510
up with

351
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:34,540
is a venture pairs love words

352
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:38,200
and scores and scored in a very from
zero to one in the to do some

353
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,590
normalization and so this be the kernel
experts doubt

354
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:45,959
is 0.157 coffee and 0.116

355
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:48,950
chocolate and I'm not gonna really
numbers but it goes on so its coffee

356
00:20:48,950 --> 00:20:49,600
chocolate

357
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,209
black dark licorice espresso

358
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:53,940
cocoa

359
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:58,139
brown better and smoke and in fact
there's about 10,000 words that all have

360
00:20:58,139 --> 00:20:58,729
scores

361
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,750
these the top 10 I'm so this gives you

362
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:05,909
a much faster and easier way to sort of
appreciate

363
00:21:05,909 --> 00:21:10,259
what the beers about them having to read
70 something 1000 characters people's

364
00:21:10,259 --> 00:21:10,879
reckons

365
00:21:10,879 --> 00:21:14,199
about colonel export stout London 1890

366
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,580
I'm the other thing that public to me
and perhaps this

367
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:20,949
sort of ages me specifically but so we
have a bunch of words and we have a

368
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:21,399
bunch of

369
00:21:21,399 --> 00:21:26,059
numbers attached two words in pairs and
that give me a flashback to my early web

370
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:26,639
browsing

371
00:21:26,639 --> 00:21:30,110
and here's a word cloud evolve those
words so because

372
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,610
I don't know about you but whenever I
see words and scores for words

373
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:36,850
I just wanna put them into work lap so
we done that and so you can see that

374
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:40,860
here you said to see the relative
weights other terms I'm so it's mostly

375
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,439
serve coffee and chocolate and then a
couple of color in notes about

376
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,100
blacken dark liquids so that's fun

377
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,279
okay so but the thing about this is that
the computer is not clever remember

378
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,629
were were performing better statistics
to trick the computer into tricking us

379
00:21:56,629 --> 00:22:00,939
that it has any idea what's going on it
does not understand its just countin

380
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:04,419
I'm so this word cloud

381
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:09,440
has a bunch of overlap over ideas better
expressed in multiple words across all

382
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:09,980
the people

383
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,460
so for instance espresso and coffee
these things

384
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:17,590
they're different but they're very
similar I especially amongst all the

385
00:22:17,590 --> 00:22:20,059
other words right they're not quite the
same thing but they're very close

386
00:22:20,059 --> 00:22:24,769
and here for instance is black and dark
and brown which are all color terms

387
00:22:24,769 --> 00:22:28,070
and especially you the refining
teleconverter dark

388
00:22:28,070 --> 00:22:31,519
doesn't exactly tell us the same thing
is black but they're

389
00:22:31,519 --> 00:22:36,289
overlap the same sort of space of
concept right are similarly we got cocoa

390
00:22:36,289 --> 00:22:38,919
and chocolate I don't know enough to
understand the difference between those

391
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:40,320
two words in the usage here

392
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,200
so what we can do is think I'll topic
modeling and topic modeling adds a

393
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,340
separate process

394
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:48,559
where you look at the whole corpus have
your text

395
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,250
and you can't how often words occur with
other words say looking for color

396
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:53,769
currents

397
00:22:53,769 --> 00:22:57,210
and this allows you to pull out words
that are commonly used together

398
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:00,610
and that's better their car called
topics here so I'm

399
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,639
the computer still doesn't know anything
about language or about humans and how

400
00:23:04,639 --> 00:23:05,549
we talk to each other

401
00:23:05,549 --> 00:23:06,940
but it its

402
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,730
sufficiently good accounting that we can
carry in lots of ways and then it's

403
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,669
better at pretending that knows what's
going on

404
00:23:11,669 --> 00:23:15,649
so so also are we can spell it in the
American Way

405
00:23:15,649 --> 00:23:18,860
and we can advance so instead of doing
that you have on your process

406
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:22,399
now where we process and do term countin
and then we do

407
00:23:22,399 --> 00:23:25,510
I docking for the county we

408
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:29,879
push all the documents through and then
we can't come occurrences as a separate

409
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,320
process that happens in advance

410
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:35,549
and then we get much topics I for most
topic modeling methods and indeed the

411
00:23:35,549 --> 00:23:36,490
one that will talk about

412
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:41,460
specifically in a second I'm you need to
specify to the algorithm how many topics

413
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,860
are expressed across the document so the
model is gonna look for say a hundred

414
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,620
topics in your document are in your
corpus

415
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:51,739
or two hundred or fifty or whatever on

416
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:56,090
on there some side effects for picking
different kinds of values for that but

417
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:58,289
that a detail that will have to skim
over

418
00:23:58,289 --> 00:24:03,129
I'm so this can be refined as well so
you can add a new doc into the corpus

419
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:05,480
center to make your topics a little bit
more accurate

420
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:10,130
and usually accurate here a sort of if
the idea I love

421
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:15,370
how correct is it that two words are
going to occur together in a

422
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:19,989
given document that the system never
seen before so if we have chocolate is

423
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:20,299
it

424
00:24:20,299 --> 00:24:23,690
very likely that we'll also have cocoa
in

425
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:28,950
a document and and that sort of idea
accuracy can get refined

426
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:35,160
with more more its own document Pfizer
to do this with all the beer reviews

427
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:38,990
what happens so we get a bunch a beer
topics

428
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:43,140
so here are the top five terms from
three topics I don't know if you guys

429
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,540
can

430
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,930
read it but we got here the first topic
is chocolate

431
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:51,910
black coffee dark and roasted and the
next topic over is smoke

432
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:55,810
smoked smoky Pete and be fair topic is

433
00:24:55,810 --> 00:24:59,020
citrus hops grapefruit orange and pine

434
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,050
so so the first topic is basically
talking about a particular flavor you

435
00:25:03,050 --> 00:25:04,050
could not have the mall

436
00:25:04,050 --> 00:25:07,770
writer dark malts are imparting these
these chocolate almonds and a little bit

437
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:08,550
of the color

438
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:12,240
affects from that same couple things
that the second one is

439
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,580
is clearly smoked beer Pete being a
common source

440
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:18,590
I've that smoke flavor and the third one
is

441
00:25:18,590 --> 00:25:21,780
a collection of flavors you get from
Hobbs

442
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:25,440
and indeed a hand that that was going on
because Haas also included

443
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,640
in that topic I'm and also all relative
terms right so

444
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:34,440
in the smoke related one the and the
percentage of

445
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,780
likelihood associate with that word is
quite the higher

446
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:41,399
inferences Pete because not all smoke
things come from Pete

447
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:46,440
so a document in this sort of worldview

448
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:50,760
is described rather than a bunch of
words is described as a major topics

449
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,530
which can then

450
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:55,300
be made up a bunch words we have a
mixture of topics another document

451
00:25:55,300 --> 00:26:00,050
so how do we do that so we are going to
use a thing called lame tourists that

452
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:00,810
allocation

453
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,340
which is very fancy sounding got three
three words one

454
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:08,929
the middle where the guys name so you
know it's fancy I'm so do I do wish let

455
00:26:08,930 --> 00:26:10,140
is a statistical tool

456
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,270
that is is basically if I could see have
a bucket

457
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:17,430
right so here's his RR color
visualization a bucket the book has four

458
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,570
colors and stuff in it

459
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:22,590
right on and each of those things has a
percentage

460
00:26:22,590 --> 00:26:25,720
other currents right so so forty-five
percent of this bucket

461
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,040
has been squares and 24 percent has pink
squares an 18 percent black person 13

462
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,990
percent as white squares

463
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:36,440
I'm so that traditionally it's basically
just a sign in

464
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,810
ratio values that all add up to one and

465
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,950
so the idea is that by the

466
00:26:41,950 --> 00:26:45,490
writing these things we can assign
probabilities to unseen things we draw

467
00:26:45,490 --> 00:26:46,710
out love that set

468
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:51,630
solution allocation is simply a method

469
00:26:51,630 --> 00:26:54,909
%uh assignee all those values given that
I have no idea what's going on inside

470
00:26:54,909 --> 00:26:57,240
this magical black box over here to the
side right

471
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,090
so I'm a

472
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,740
informal this is really informal I need
to take an aside and tell you that I'm

473
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,720
telling you things they're not quite
mathematically correct

474
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,830
but basically when you do is every time
you draw a landslide

475
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,389
and real peace from the dish that you
learn a little bit more about contents

476
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:15,760
right

477
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,330
so if RI know there's a bucket of balls
in the Baltic colors

478
00:27:20,330 --> 00:27:23,750
and I pull one out I know a little bit
about this our poll two out in all a bit

479
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:25,370
more and I just repeat forever

480
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:29,279
into I have perfect information about
the contents of the bucket that I can

481
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:30,820
actually see all the content all at once

482
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:33,899
on fine

483
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:37,018
cell if you go back to the curb air

484
00:27:37,019 --> 00:27:40,590
we started to talk with and you can
always text again

485
00:27:40,590 --> 00:27:45,459
and then what happens is we get some
topic so these are the top four topics

486
00:27:45,460 --> 00:27:49,630
for the kernel export stout and what
we've done with this is we've pushed

487
00:27:49,630 --> 00:27:54,330
all of the dark beer flavored things
into a single topic in the front

488
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:58,289
so instead of having about forty percent
above the words that showed up in that

489
00:27:58,289 --> 00:28:00,190
were graphed are in that

490
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,929
in that workload rather on it's just a
single topic and we have a percentage

491
00:28:04,929 --> 00:28:09,760
associate with the topic and then that
we have to her three other topics rather

492
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:14,389
not quite the same that were things that
were missed in the previous method so

493
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:17,719
the the second topic for the others read
them for their

494
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,389
I for you because you can't buy makeup
applied to the first topic is are dark

495
00:28:21,389 --> 00:28:23,209
brown sweet fruit raisins

496
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:27,539
so not some coffee espresso notion a
darkly we saw an example it's more of a

497
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,620
like a rich I

498
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:34,320
sort of dark dark fruit like like prunes
or figs this kind of

499
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,550
kind of dark labor and then you have are
from

500
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:41,750
topic that goes through peach tropical
mango apichart and the hoppy topic

501
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:45,870
that's better pine dominated and then a
topic in a presentation

502
00:28:45,870 --> 00:28:49,370
Poor's nice head sweet aroma so

503
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,110
this is a interesting collection of
things that actually

504
00:28:54,110 --> 00:28:57,360
says the rather than just being hit you
on the top of the face with

505
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,429
roasted notes when you actually
everything here is a sorta

506
00:29:00,430 --> 00:29:03,600
deep dark beer with a lot of assertive

507
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:07,480
aged fruit notes right a lot of a lot of
prune notes and

508
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:10,920
things like this which I think actually
more accurate given this beer but

509
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,929
I'll let you guys find a bottle with
this and make your own

510
00:29:13,929 --> 00:29:18,570
decisions so to go back we have these
four

511
00:29:18,570 --> 00:29:22,689
for ideas can be mapped this for flavor
ideas to topics

512
00:29:22,690 --> 00:29:26,390
in our corpus because topic models as an
exercise not only part it out

513
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:30,260
all your documents not just about
specific items invited your compass

514
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:35,309
so we have water as I am and in a rotary
hops hops is

515
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:39,270
citrus hop grapefruit orange pine
molting which is %uh

516
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:43,120
Carmel amber malt sweet copper yeast

517
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,379
banana clove bubble gum bubble gum and
then water

518
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:50,800
now the thing about water colin White
graph the light had so this is

519
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,250
a bit of a reach the thing about water
is that the flavor you get from water

520
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:58,230
is flavor you don't notice so everything
goes right with your beer

521
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:01,580
those flavors are gonna get shop
somewhere else the accredited somewhere

522
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,059
else

523
00:30:02,059 --> 00:30:05,678
and you only really notice your water
profile when

524
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,910
you get a sense over which is not
something you want

525
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:12,170
or when you're just in case anyone
thought that was a good idea

526
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:16,570
and over here it is for the salty which
unless you're drinking a really obscure

527
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,189
style from northern Germany is also not
something you want

528
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm so so that the water style

529
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:27,020
though the reason why a tie this topic
to water is because this topic describes

530
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:31,260
I a lot of characteristics from pills or
beers

531
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,710
and pills appears used extremely soft
water profiles and if you get the water

532
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,650
for how wrong

533
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:39,929
the style dressed entirely off so if you
see beers the described

534
00:30:39,929 --> 00:30:42,130
as white and golden

535
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:46,560
and possibly the grassy just a hop hop
note for that same kind of

536
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,409
style if your water profile is not
basically extraordinarily soft it's all

537
00:30:51,410 --> 00:30:52,130
gone all wrong

538
00:30:52,130 --> 00:30:56,080
is not beer styles that you can make
with groundwater from basically anywhere

539
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:00,120
in England for instance now

540
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:04,959
so so I'm in another round of the talk
with the practical and timely

541
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,610
information

542
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:08,800
so this is the beetle is that the robot
arms there are times as the pub

543
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,250
that's right over there right over there
in the tent like it's like 4 10's down

544
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,930
where the various a camp so so this has
a

545
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:19,970
yesterday are the beers that are either
on right now or will be on at some point

546
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:20,640
the next three days

547
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,340
I'm these movies these beers also
important now in use for calibrating

548
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,399
your you doing it for him

549
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,870
and in the top three terms I

550
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,709
that are associated with it appears so
on go through MKE a real-time

551
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:37,550
I so the packets so we've got three bars
from openly that the Pegasus

552
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:40,580
which is amber and bitter and apparently
the musher me

553
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,149
announce the Internet you have to go
with and I

554
00:31:44,150 --> 00:31:47,410
so the moon justina soft for PG

555
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:51,040
so in contrast even though the Steelers
are both men say maybe

556
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,379
this beer is going to be more pay also
said a blonde a little floral from the

557
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:56,000
hearts right

558
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:59,220
sonya the ultimate are which is a mild

559
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:04,520
and got a pretty standard profile for a
mild coffee dark mild Browns is brown

560
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,460
more than black

561
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:08,610
3.3 percent not too much rain

562
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,189
which is the session beer so it's
session ID amber and the human desire

563
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:16,500
which I don't have the uniform because
i've had for the other speedily

564
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:21,010
and the arbiter which is a pretty
session amber beer

565
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:24,480
the castle rock which is a pretty golden
great for beer

566
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:27,500
and Becks beer for those of you that
like

567
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:30,590
that sort of thing is pale and golden
and watery

568
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:34,780
again I take no credit for these words
and the star prom in

569
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:38,950
golden floral and metallic I'm so

570
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:42,930
up with that I'm going to pause hair
back I'll go back to can all

571
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:45,930
taken out and i'm i'm happy to question
the thing about 10 more minutes

572
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,930
stop

573
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:02,440
so the question was how do you riviere
how do you deal with negatives

574
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,900
and and the sample was it not hobby or
its not golden

575
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:10,200
I'm so the DEM the first

576
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:14,070
first answer is that probably the
hardest sir

577
00:33:14,070 --> 00:33:17,370
part love this kind of thing on and

578
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:21,590
in this particular case I can get around
it because I've the

579
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:25,909
nature of the data I'm if you if you
look through the beer reviews it's very

580
00:33:25,910 --> 00:33:28,230
uncommon for people to describe beer

581
00:33:28,230 --> 00:33:32,480
in the negative it does happen a little
bit because it's not common and

582
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:34,240
effective you're doing is taking a much
ravages

583
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,990
its Argos out in the wash in particular
case so it's not a problem I karen's

584
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:38,570
dataset

585
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,939
on there are some method so some other
things you can do with

586
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:46,410
topic modeling will start to suss out
some other negation

587
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:50,500
I'm so if you find because it's rare
that someone's going to say in assorted

588
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:51,480
50-50 split

589
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,300
are not happy and happy for just for
different beers right what's far more

590
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,520
common is that certain

591
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:01,620
words get negated and if that's the case
then will happen is that will get pulled

592
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:01,939
out

593
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:04,960
in gathering topics are can and I i
again i mean

594
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,280
though the way you deal with negation
because it's quite difficult tends to be

595
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:10,470
less generalize to tends to be that
you're going to you

596
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:13,850
you something the you know this
particular to the domain

597
00:34:13,850 --> 00:34:17,880
right I'm and in this case because we
care most about had it is me know the

598
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,790
people are generally positive describing

599
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:26,790
yeah yeah

600
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,129
okay so for the question was I we're
working with a quite narrow domain

601
00:34:41,129 --> 00:34:41,770
appear

602
00:34:41,770 --> 00:34:46,349
and how do we do topic modeling for a
general offer large remain like the

603
00:34:46,349 --> 00:34:48,099
whole English language for instance yeah

604
00:34:48,099 --> 00:34:51,840
or something something bigger than beer
beers quite big but yes

605
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,879
so I think I'm topics

606
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:01,200
are almost always useful no matter how
much sort of generalization they're

607
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:01,799
doing right

608
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,790
so that the work in a topic is doing it
effectively going from

609
00:35:05,790 --> 00:35:08,880
every single word its own little animal

610
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,900
to 100 or 200 slightly more

611
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:16,240
complicated statistical models but then
you can do some things with right

612
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:20,618
and so how well it works depends on how
much work it doing

613
00:35:20,619 --> 00:35:23,630
but it's always going to be helpful so
if you have

614
00:35:23,630 --> 00:35:26,580
the whole English and I don't know
there's a hundred thousand words or two

615
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:27,630
hundred thousand words

616
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:32,080
across all other documents and you're
reducing that to 200

617
00:35:32,080 --> 00:35:35,380
topics say so then is topic an average

618
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:40,720
is covering the space love I'm what Mike
100000 100000 want right so

619
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:44,200
size bath for math thousand words I'm
and

620
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,430
and so so I mean for your topics are
gonna be broader so

621
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:52,549
here in beer we've got topics that talk
about half an topic the talk about amber

622
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,170
malt and topics to talk about

623
00:35:54,170 --> 00:35:57,330
adding smoke and if you did the same
number of topics

624
00:35:57,330 --> 00:36:00,910
on analysis I love a corpus of the comes
brother from English

625
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:04,710
maybe you talk about beer or I have
brought the

626
00:36:04,710 --> 00:36:09,210
the corpses you get a topic the talks
about alcoholic beverages right on

627
00:36:09,210 --> 00:36:12,300
and so so it's a matter of above what

628
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:17,150
what detail you'll see and how quickly
you can do an analysis and how how well

629
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,020
you can measure

630
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:21,230
injured document distance so one of the
things people like to do with topics

631
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,790
that doesn't quite fit

632
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:26,190
in this amount of time is it actually
measure

633
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:29,970
how close to things are I am and

634
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:34,029
and that works really well with arm
fewer topics

635
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:35,489
so the

636
00:36:35,489 --> 00:36:38,419
maybe 50 or 100 and there's some

637
00:36:38,419 --> 00:36:42,209
a mathematical reasoning basically that
the smaller the number of topics

638
00:36:42,209 --> 00:36:45,839
the more accurate that distance measures
going to be but

639
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:50,659
you lose sort of semantic understanding
you lose and I i appreciation of what

640
00:36:50,659 --> 00:36:51,659
each topic means

641
00:36:51,659 --> 00:36:56,449
so the the underlying math to do
distance between documents

642
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:59,849
doesn't actually depend on the topics
being understandable by people

643
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:04,429
I'm but then you can use the topics in a
different way

644
00:37:04,429 --> 00:37:09,140
I and you get that as well Sam more
questions

645
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,348
we have a five-minute sure there's
something else you ask me

646
00:37:12,349 --> 00:37:16,099
no me

647
00:37:16,099 --> 00:37:23,099
many have stumped you a whole over the
back yes

648
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:35,300
I'm okay so so the question the question
and i hope i heard it over the

649
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:39,130
we will meet and correctly was what's
her aspirations to have for this way

650
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:42,440
racing at from the first thing going in
general or just with beer

651
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:46,680
both okay arm so

652
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:49,890
I mean horse the books I guess

653
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,560
is is a good answer for this concept I
think on the thing about natural

654
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,140
language processing is that it's quite

655
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,529
powerful but what it doesn't do is teach

656
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:01,550
anyone about language so I I've I've hit

657
00:38:01,550 --> 00:38:07,530
I had this point a couple times on but
no matter what it looks like

658
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,670
the software doesn't understand speech
right

659
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:13,880
the software it's like when you I'll

660
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,330
when when people get beaten by computers
playing chess

661
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:20,430
in our plane just the same way a human
place just right and there's a sort of

662
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:24,580
third to lose analogy but if they it's
it's a roughly analogous right where

663
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:30,460
where basically you're you're giving
some software tools to pretend like

664
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:31,640
nothing's going on right

665
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:36,790
and I think one other ways where you can
see this is if you look at the sort of

666
00:38:36,790 --> 00:38:39,190
the flip side of national image
processing which is gone that ruling was

667
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:39,980
generation

668
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:43,270
where you get I so in this case you
would get

669
00:38:43,270 --> 00:38:46,340
the computer given some beer to tell you

670
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,980
a sort of prose review about the beer
right so if they're just a list

671
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:51,109
additives you get

672
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:54,960
you know the beer initially drank with a
bit of straw

673
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:59,100
and had a media mouth feel that closed
into a bitter long finish that was great

674
00:38:59,100 --> 00:38:59,950
I'd like another

675
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:03,118
right instead of allister straw better
amber golden

676
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:06,830
right and what you find with most other
systems is that they tend to be

677
00:39:06,830 --> 00:39:10,920
highly rule-based end with skeletal
structures somewhere in their system

678
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:14,859
so it's very hard to get I basically a
computer to

679
00:39:14,859 --> 00:39:19,400
improvise and you just sort of make it
complicated enough

680
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,990
Ave fixed systematic feels like improve
the

681
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:26,950
improvisation to humans and I I mean

682
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:31,600
to me this is the kind of thing is can
we can we build sufficient complicated

683
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,680
models that the

684
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:36,470
the software actually understand enough
to sort of

685
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:41,049
pastor in test some things like this
right and yeah

686
00:39:41,049 --> 00:39:44,460
sim its I think there should be a
conversation is Ben's

687
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:49,650
on okay more questions I have five
minutes apparently

688
00:39:49,650 --> 00:39:56,650
yeah so

689
00:39:59,269 --> 00:40:04,549
I mean from well

690
00:40:04,549 --> 00:40:08,420
I think I think it depends like like all
people who care enough

691
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:11,809
I'm going to say that it depends on when
I'm I

692
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,890
I would probably start with either the
just enough or maybe

693
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:19,529
be arbiter and then go from there to you

694
00:40:19,529 --> 00:40:23,309
one of the two amber session beers are

695
00:40:23,309 --> 00:40:29,380
and then maybe a mild so probably the
probably the movie 349 a

696
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:32,890
it depends that I'm the thing I will say
is that I'm

697
00:40:32,890 --> 00:40:38,460
what I think that's really nice about
doing this kind of analysis for beer

698
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:42,200
is that it's a really good way to figure
out what

699
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:46,200
is more likely to satisfy your interest
in your tastes

700
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,680
without having to drink a bunch a beer
first right so

701
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,169
if if I know what I'm after

702
00:40:54,170 --> 00:40:57,739
I can look at a list like this I'm not
familiar with any the beer so I

703
00:40:57,739 --> 00:41:01,559
if I want to start with oblong

704
00:41:01,559 --> 00:41:04,829
it's reasonably the way be and is quite
quite happy

705
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,119
so I can tell you from this list and I
think I had to have the bears on this

706
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:10,559
was before but I can tell you with a
pretty high amount of confidence that

707
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:10,900
its

708
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:14,469
either gonna be just enough or the
arbiter

709
00:41:14,469 --> 00:41:18,039
that are that sort of beer right and
actually want to be the kind of like

710
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:18,599
that but

711
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,670
more aggressively hot with sort of
aromatics in the front and maybe some

712
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:24,479
new world

713
00:41:24,479 --> 00:41:28,879
big big heart the you get its it's going
to be the castle rock artist pale

714
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:32,019
and in fact the difference between the
has our car was pale and the other two

715
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:32,649
beers

716
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:36,549
is quite clearly in the hop aroma
profile on

717
00:41:36,549 --> 00:41:40,180
and if you see a shortlist attendance at
least three this becomes more apparent

718
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:44,890
right so they're similar in the words
that you see describing malt

719
00:41:44,890 --> 00:41:49,250
mmm which are mostly color related or
something bread and cereal kind words

720
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:52,310
but then the words that are used to
describe

721
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:56,420
the aroma are wildly different so you
get sort of

722
00:41:56,420 --> 00:41:59,420
us afterwards around the

723
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:04,890
I just enough blame to the bitter so the
Justin for example has PG appear right

724
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:08,359
and PD is very soft kinda pop I'm no

725
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:11,420
you getting in beer and that he had
grapefruit

726
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,770
for their for the castle rock which is a
as a key trigger word

727
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,860
for big american hop aroma has used by
commonly right

728
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:22,680
I'm so yeah I think maybe that's at my
non ANSWER Answer

729
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,339
yeah so

730
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:33,960
so the code base that does both analysis
lives in a get a project called consume

731
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,460
underscore our beer

732
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,350
arm and there's a link to it as part of
the slide decks are a few go to the link

733
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:41,940
that the slide deck is on a tight
tweeted earlier not put around a little

734
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:42,540
later as well

735
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:45,590
I'm there's just it's I get her project

736
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:48,790
at the top of the screen and in fact I
have an SQL dump

737
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:51,960
love all the data that are due process
which I will happily give you if you

738
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,690
come talk to me

739
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:56,470
you can have a couple games and they
really like that and

740
00:42:56,470 --> 00:43:03,470
yeah Chris

741
00:43:09,270 --> 00:43:12,470
I'm so 90 companies there commercially
viable

742
00:43:12,470 --> 00:43:16,830
I'm I so so I had a go at making a
product

743
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:20,270
for her endeavors and that didn't quite
work I think regarding knew that answer

744
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:23,750
I am I I think

745
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:27,890
I think there are there have been some
attempts

746
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:31,040
on I actually so im in

747
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,610
in and trying to think everything that's

748
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:39,310
bed actually viable in beer and more so
the closing you get this summer the

749
00:43:39,310 --> 00:43:40,200
social network

750
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:44,100
are kinda recommender things that happen
around around here so I contact for

751
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:46,650
instance although it does really
leverage data very well does really dumb

752
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:47,770
collecting all the data

753
00:43:47,770 --> 00:43:53,420
on I am yeah and then also there's a
there's a wine app it does to my things

754
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:53,750
calm

755
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:57,120
call divert the No that actually is a
little better about attending a text

756
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,630
cell

757
00:43:57,630 --> 00:44:02,790
on it solicit I think part this is
because wind nerds tend to write more

758
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:07,380
and so there's there's just like in a
sorta brought in stereotype making kind

759
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:07,830
of way

760
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:11,830
I'm so they're they're both the the two
outs are quite similar except for that

761
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,670
one just the other one other deals
appear

762
00:44:13,670 --> 00:44:16,910
and vino has a big big

763
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:20,359
free text field and and untapped is like
give us

764
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:24,010
20 characters you feel like it and so
the result is you get things there's a

765
00:44:24,010 --> 00:44:24,940
closer

766
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,770
to the senate link the reviews and it's
quite hard to do love these techniques

767
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:30,180
with very short text

768
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,850
because a lot of it depends on words
occurring next to each other

769
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,210
and that is just gonna work better with
longer things so but maybe not as a

770
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:38,640
quite good job of pulling out

771
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,670
are this one is aboard oh that's going
to be quite a full body paying

772
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:45,720
or this whole thing and I'm not sure
which techniques they use but they're

773
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,399
clearly doing some language processing

774
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:47,970
I

775
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,959
service I'm the to sum up the search to
them

776
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:57,960
um

777
00:44:59,150 --> 00:45:02,560
I have not there is are some quite
hilarious

778
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:06,940
scholarly work that are has looked at
are comparing

779
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:10,109
commercial price points and social
descriptors

780
00:45:10,109 --> 00:45:14,000
arm and also our commercial kitchen so
there was some

781
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,980
the study was originally done with a
wind-aided about ten years ago

782
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:21,430
arm where basically a look at the
commercial description

783
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:24,819
and the price and determined that and
also I like

784
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:29,250
an expert reviews so late from New Mex
course United Wine Advocate give it a

785
00:45:29,250 --> 00:45:31,060
90-year an 86 or whatever

786
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:34,240
and they found no correlation between
price

787
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:38,669
and the review score but they found a
strong correlation between

788
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:42,109
the average word length in the reviews
and the price

789
00:45:42,109 --> 00:45:45,589
so sign up the commercial commercial he
is still like went to the back label

790
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:50,130
cell expensive wine they use big words
but is not necessarily any better

791
00:45:50,130 --> 00:45:53,990
was the like broad take away from this
review I'm I

792
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:58,060
I have spoken with a friend of mine and
I do mean similar kind announces the

793
00:45:58,060 --> 00:45:58,589
beer

794
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:01,779
the the market for beers a bit different
so so

795
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,420
the the price variance is very small so
I think

796
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:09,740
with that work a decent amount have the
effect comes from the edges

797
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:13,618
so really expensive wine gets really
flowery language

798
00:46:13,619 --> 00:46:16,650
and cheap wine people describe as it
will get you drunk

799
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:19,790
light and up but but with beer because
the outliers

800
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,880
arm much closer together read like that
achieves beer you can buy

801
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:26,760
is at around 12 pack of something awful
for five pounds and then the most

802
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:27,730
expensive beat by like

803
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:30,660
the most expensive you can buy is two
hundred quid and that's a really

804
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:31,848
expensive be right

805
00:46:31,849 --> 00:46:34,890
and there's like to have those and so so

806
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:40,009
because burden the possible prices a lot
narrower and most beers just a couple

807
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:41,260
pounds masha it

808
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:45,040
I don't know how much you get a
commercial kinda correspondents on

809
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:48,170
yeah and then the other thing the you
could do is

810
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:51,510
is if you compare

811
00:46:51,510 --> 00:46:54,480
the commercial description to you the
social descriptions

812
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,869
I am my suspicion is that in most cases
they would all agree

813
00:47:00,869 --> 00:47:03,210
they were just be using different
language to talk about the thing kinda

814
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:04,640
stuff on

815
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:08,650
but yeah I would be interesting to see
if that's right now I'm without

816
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:11,920
as a running mate on cam can tell Fisher
on

817
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:18,540
yeah anybody else cool I think about it
I'm ass i works

818
00:47:18,540 --> 00:47:25,540
thanks so much guys

819
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:35,440
which one

820
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,240
who could I

821
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,790
this one's find this is much better
