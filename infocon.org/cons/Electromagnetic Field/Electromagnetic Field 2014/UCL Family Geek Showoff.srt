1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:14,820
hello everybody welcome to each of we're
going to kick the keg of I would say

2
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,690
that and

3
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:20,920
this gig is kind of comedy a nice a kind
of comedy in the I know the I'm funny

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,660
but I can't guarantee anyone else

5
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:26,590
so it's a thing way if you wanna be down
the front that would be amazing

6
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:29,869
but also even if you don't wanna be down
the front we need you to make quite a

7
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:31,140
lot of noise

8
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,140
I'll do that Waldie now

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,000
is I'll do that like a compact what we
need is he's awake while although I'd

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,190
like to go

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,589
plays just when would you please welcome
to stage or hosted peak show off

12
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:52,000
is me state by the

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,750
thank you very much indeed

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,030
this is tremendously exciting is
tremendously exciting

15
00:00:59,030 --> 00:01:03,090
but let's be honest is also a little bit
awkward where fields

16
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,100
in the mid love wherever this field is I
just got on the truck

17
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,140
did anyone else come did anyone else get
the shuttle bus

18
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,540
to the site's there's a lovely bit
whether San unmarked

19
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,869
truck and you stop when they go get on
the truck

20
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:20,810
a my first thought was no happy story

21
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:24,590
starts everybody get on the on Mar
struck

22
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:28,859
as I was very frightening hello everyone
hello at what we gonna do now is

23
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:32,630
a thing I do called each show off and
appoint a peach of

24
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:35,670
is its little bits have me and then it's
longer bits

25
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,749
of people who really clever talking
about whatever is that they like

26
00:01:39,749 --> 00:01:42,639
so they can talk about things that
obsessed them things that they do in

27
00:01:42,639 --> 00:01:43,658
their everyday lives

28
00:01:43,659 --> 00:01:47,090
and I go all over the country doing
things like this I am what is

29
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:48,459
technically known

30
00:01:48,459 --> 00:01:52,789
as a science comedian keiko who

31
00:01:52,789 --> 00:01:58,189
that was exactly the right level love
who is required to the site's comedian

32
00:01:58,189 --> 00:02:00,359
let me tell you why in 2012

33
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,389
the Independent on Sunday named me as
one of Britain's

34
00:02:04,389 --> 00:02:09,479
top 5 science comedians kinda big a rule

35
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,299
there are currently 6 science comedians
in Britain

36
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:16,760
is why a sad to claim to fame to have
their

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:22,149
a sadly that one right that fact has not
yet made it onto my Wikipedia page

38
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:26,080
on how to Wikipedia page the two weeks
game each year if you've got a Wikipedia

39
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,680
page

40
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,160
me I thought this place we flew them

41
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,700
people hacking in from the other side of
the world pretending to be someone else

42
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,970
getting themselves Wikipedia page you
killed your

43
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,010
no I do Wikipedia page two weeks is
currently

44
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:42,940
where I am learning just how awful human
beings all

45
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,040
because it's it's this amazing see
evening

46
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,540
back a passive aggression there were
only two lines

47
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,780
in my Wikipedia page and people are
fighting over every single word last

48
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:55,200
week

49
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,609
my Wikipedia page began Steve cross

50
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,670
is a comedian it now begins Steve cross

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,989
is a self-described comedian genuinely

52
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,560
can look any view our editors can even
take out because it is so hot

53
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:15,580
am rights so we've got we've got some
families in the room hello kids

54
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,800
hello hello now I should say I don't
normally compaq extra children only I

55
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,600
compaq eggs in like sweaty pub basements
and things

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,019
so this is a little bit of a challenge
for me cuz ninety-five percent to the

57
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,600
stuff

58
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:30,220
I would normally do I can't do and the
first time I ever

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,580
I ever compared to take where with
children in the reams last year

60
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:36,740
at the Green Man Festival and

61
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:40,000
I didn't know what to do it's like my
job to get you all really excited so

62
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,870
that when I bring on the people that
know about science and technology

63
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:44,460
engineering and all those amazing things

64
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,170
that you're going to cheer them like
crazy a so I didn't like it was the I

65
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,450
asked all the children in the audience
what their favorite things were

66
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:54,820
and then if they weren't popping into
enough I would just shout their favorite

67
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:55,640
things at them

68
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,739
because the best way to get any child
really happy and really interested in

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,110
what you're doing is just to go

70
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:06,710
why Libya okay see

71
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:10,010
it doesn't work at all am but I what I
wanted to share with you is what what

72
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:11,989
the kids have 2013 you're into

73
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:16,049
and kids a 2014 if you're into these
things i wanna know about it so as to

74
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:18,329
these kids what's your favorite thing in
the whole world

75
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:20,820
and I'll go to the edges stage and I'd
lean down

76
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:24,120
night was favorite thing so the first
kid I went up to

77
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,680
i sat what's your favorite thing and he
looked at me

78
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,700
and first divall he pushed his glasses
up

79
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,210
because that's what we do when we
thinking

80
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:37,419
glasses I like nerds cigarettes

81
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,230
they just give you a chance to do a
thing why you think and it's free

82
00:04:41,230 --> 00:04:45,550
he looked to me and he said lightbulbs

83
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:52,250
not I can see the point of fact because
that's really cheap parenting

84
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,640
he wants to always what we gonna do well

85
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,200
I just change the light bulb should we
tell him that light poles the toys

86
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,740
and I was quite fun now than in the next
kid I went up to us it was your favorite

87
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,670
thing in the world

88
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,890
I looked him and he looks at me look
deep into my eyes

89
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,930
and he looked all the way down to the
bottom of my soul

90
00:05:10,930 --> 00:05:14,920
and he actually set darkness

91
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,420
so I went

92
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:22,680
so he went

93
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,100
darkness

94
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:33,660
and comedy that is a kid who is really
annoyed

95
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:37,570
that the show that we're doing a thirty
where I will be properly drunken sway re

96
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:41,080
is adults only am at so that's all very
exciting

97
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,240
kids in the room considering kids are
doing to them have any view any view

98
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,500
into science

99
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,950
to do science is cool yes

100
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,440
now are you know I wanted to tell you a
story about when I was a child

101
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,620
and I'm only telling this story in order
to watch your parents windstar whole way

102
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,280
through

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,530
and try and tell you never to do this so
when I was at school I was

104
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,469
the kid that was good at science and I
was also the kid that really knew he was

105
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:06,340
good at science

106
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,710
and I was also the kid you haven't
really developed any of the social

107
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:10,390
skills

108
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:13,919
that would prevent this from being
annoying to give you an idea of the kind

109
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,990
of things that we used to do

110
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,740
way to physics practical yet to take
lots have measurements

111
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:22,110
by changing one variable I mean standard
physics stuff

112
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,910
what my friend and I did was we did the
first measurement we did the last

113
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:25,690
measurement

114
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,430
which align the chewing them up and then
we just made up the other points

115
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:32,790
being slightly off cuz we're not perfect
we want to send the message

116
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,780
so I we've made it

117
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:37,539
up with scattered the points a little
bit we got busted and the teacher came

118
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,639
over and he said

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,790
there listen Steve Duncan there is no
place in this world

120
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:48,740
for theoretical physicists to put this
story

121
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,830
in more perspective Duncan who I did
that with

122
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:56,169
is a professor a theoretical physics at
cornell university now

123
00:06:56,169 --> 00:07:00,080
it's absurd anyway the other things that
we used to do with science experiments

124
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:03,150
that you weren't supposed to do one of
our experiments was called

125
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,919
what happens if you put a spoonful have
your cats

126
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:13,250
into a desk everyday I would scribes
experiment you properly

127
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:18,280
as a scientific space experiment methods
a desk

128
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,599
was taken it was in it was there in the
beginning we didn't like bring in a

129
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,480
special desk

130
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:26,710
at into the desk was placed one

131
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:30,750
heaped teaspoon it's important to be
accurate when you're doing science was a

132
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,660
level teaspoon is heaped teaspoon

133
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,940
of natural yogurt each day observations

134
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,530
day one nothing day to

135
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:44,530
nothing day three the desk smells

136
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:48,440
day 4 the desks smells

137
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,880
really bad day 5

138
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:56,440
the desk is not there anymore apparently
they took it away

139
00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,060
and burned it it was the only way to
deal with at all sucked in his inquiry

140
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,640
disgusting

141
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,409
anyway as enough about me I'm gonna
bring on some people who knows and stuff

142
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,880
about some stuff to Mitch if you like
people who know some stuff about some

143
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,310
stuff

144
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,350
the

145
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:15,590
the you're an amazing audience absent
issue already spread out and win a giant

146
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:16,700
tents normally

147
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:21,070
both of those are the death of joy but
you also joyful it's brilliant

148
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:24,750
am I'll that's so this is a lovely first
was it some of the first level in three

149
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,290
nice

150
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,340
M and the so many brilliant people here
all come together

151
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,510
not doing the things you normally do not
shopping in the shots you normally shop

152
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,090
on

153
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:37,280
Mattman share price has gone down 5
percent just today

154

thank you very much am great see all hit
thank you

164
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:16,280
I know a competing against three so many
awesome talks am

165
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:20,280
so mine if there wasn't and I am a PhD
student

166
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,439
act UCL and the thing that I study

167
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,830
is errors things going wrong right so

168
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:30,750
I have to say up front that any areas
that do occur during the set

169
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:34,530
about intentional and very well
choreographed okay

170
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:38,380
just to be prepared site let's talk
about aris

171
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:43,740
right Sarah I hear you cry why should we
listen to you don't even have your PhD

172
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,310
yet

173
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,619
well firstly that a really mean thing
fee to bring me up right now okay

174
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,810
PHD's a hard time trying really I'm
trying a.k.a

175
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:55,790
a hand in a few weeks I kuru my
supervisor just got my back alright

176
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,920
and secondly I I don't actually

177
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,530
need a PhD to be honest with you because
I actually have something

178
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,079
that better right academics we're all
striving

179
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:12,220
to be cited by now appears we're all
striving to have people

180
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,470
read our papers and write about them but
screw that that's not for me that's not

181
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:17,240
for me it'll

182
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:21,470
more why meaningful is far better it's
far better

183
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:25,029
which is why my name appeared in a
national

184
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:30,330
newspaper recently Sarah wiseman
University College London here we go

185
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:33,649
that's a far better than getting my
academic peers to cite me okay

186
00:10:33,649 --> 00:10:37,980
this is a national newspaper and what's
more what's more is no longer

187
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:41,279
am I just a lowly PhD scientist 09

188
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,740
now I'm a scientist and

189
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:49,410
not only at high now bean lifted to the
bank serving

190
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:53,089
scientist I'm actually a Daily Mail

191
00:10:53,089 --> 00:11:00,089
accredited scientists thank you very
much thank you

192
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:03,410
appropriate reaction I think and as such

193
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:06,640
this new position I come up with gems

194
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,199
such as customers who make mistakes are
not

195
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:16,250
idiots what that's mind blowing it only
take me three or four years to come to

196
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,580
that conclusion okay

197
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,910
that's a real insight you're not gonna
get that a wonder the universe or

198
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:21,399
anything

199
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:24,450
is Nani each right

200
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,940
okay so as you can get from this I like
talking about aris so

201
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,980
let's start thinking about why

202
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:34,940
areas matter okay so I'm gonna ask you a
question

203
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:38,480
what do you think a.m. bar charts

204
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,490
and NHS patient safety records have in
common

205
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:45,200
the answer is and about to try and make
a joke using both

206
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,910
in my case i strap in and get ready now
I am going to show you some

207
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:53,719
data from a this is being taken
legitimately from

208
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,800
from the NHS right this is not made up
in any way this is stuff has

209
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,219
beat this naturally occurred in the NHS
okay

210
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:03,510
so the graph I'm about to show you is a

211
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,709
graph showing you a subset of patients
that were admitted

212
00:12:06,709 --> 00:12:10,589
to geriatric care the last few years
okay geriatric care being

213
00:12:10,589 --> 00:12:15,890
care for elderly people right can anyone
see any mistakes in this

214
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,960
yeah

215
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,440
no one on this graph is over the age of
19

216
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:23,940
I am so that's a bit of an anonymous not
just talking about the fact of

217
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:27,550
for got to label the x-axis I know that
okay I know that you will so that day

218
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:28,490
but I know it too

219
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,820
again it's not just having at this end
of the spectrum happening at the other

220
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,550
and inspected

221
00:12:32,550 --> 00:12:36,060
so this is going to be a graph love all
the people admitted to

222
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:40,510
adolescent psychiatric care now on this
graph

223
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,850
is under the age of 30 now I don't know
about you

224
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:49,390
right but I do know some immature people
but no one is so immature

225
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,660
that medically speaking the NHS will
treat them

226
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,819
as a child now what is going on here
what's happening well

227
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:01,740
either a year these people these medical
workers they're entering this data into

228
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,550
medical records

229
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:06,430
and making some a recess living up when
they enter this data all

230
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,719
and which i think is more likely this is
proof that benjamin buttons and don't

231
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:11,370
exist

232
00:13:11,370 --> 00:13:14,550
okay and I think it's not just happening
with

233
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:19,500
age it's also happening with gender so I
mean that show you a graph

234
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:22,820
all the men in the past two years who
were pregnant

235
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:27,760
this is male admissions obstetrics
gynecology and midwife

236
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,920
epistle hosts okay again is someone

237
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,810
making a route when entering the data
into records or is it brief

238
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:38,790
that this type the film is more of a
documentary than we could ever realize

239
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:42,459
now okay those those those graphs were
kinda stupid and

240
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:45,849
they were funny right there there is
resulted in kinda

241
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:49,040
stupid statistics coming out and that's
kinda amusing

242
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,370
am but unfortunately sometimes areas
that happen in the medical domain

243
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:56,870
they're not so funny right when people
enter some data

244
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,140
it can mean that a patient gets
seriously harmed or even killed

245
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,730
and so as a result of this we are trying
as

246
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:06,950
researches into technology to understand

247
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:10,810
what happens when people make the stops
there is why these air is happening

248
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,760
now I'm a scientist and the way the
ivory settings is that I stick people in

249
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,529
a laboratory

250
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:21,649
and I get introduced okay and this is
hard to do when you're studying ARA

251
00:14:21,649 --> 00:14:25,670
like for two reasons now one reason that
you can study area in a lab

252
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,500
is that when you get people into a party
situation everything becomes quite

253
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,600
artificial in

254
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:33,660
fake and so it's hard to take the
results from the lab

255
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:37,149
and generalized into the real world
school ecological validity

256
00:14:37,149 --> 00:14:40,380
and so that means studying areas in a
lab is quite hot

257
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:44,180
the second reason it's quite hard is an
actually just makes you really bad

258
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,199
person because

259
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:48,839
essentially I'm bringing someone into a
room sitting with them

260
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:53,329
and waiting for them to fail and that's
just bad feel so lonely and I'm

261
00:14:53,329 --> 00:14:57,290
but luckily luckily I don't need to do
everything

262
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:00,339
in a laboratory I can get some data from
the real world

263
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:03,660
and that is what I and my fellow
researchers at UCLA doing

264
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,660
we taking to Twitter to get real
examples Vera

265
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,009
so what we do asking people to switch

266
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:14,360
from the primary use of Twitter which is

267
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:19,220
getting incredibly and legitimately i
right about baking competitions

268
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:23,560
and we're asking them to instead help us
with our research

269
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,160
and so all we're doing is asking people
to every time they make an era

270
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,180
is to tweet about it and tag it with
hash tag

271
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,349
every diary it two straight quarters at
and then that simple thing will allow

272
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:38,029
our website a retiree to Aug to go
through on a Twitter

273
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:41,920
and collect these examples a Paris which
creates is amazing

274
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,229
database %uh slips and mistakes

275
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:49,339
now I'm gonna talk about its mistakes
briefly

276
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:52,370
as it ever researcher I'm actually quite

277
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,000
a bad friend am so the other day

278
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,990
my friend he well a few months ago he
ended up breaking up with

279
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:03,189
his girlfriend now it's a normal story
right

280
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:08,189
this his girlfriend had head gone out
one night and had kissed someone else

281
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:12,029
and he was thank you he was he was he
was that he was distraught he was it

282
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,829
destroys US and

283
00:16:13,829 --> 00:16:16,589
and it was a pretty you know it's a it's
a terrible thing you know he was really

284
00:16:16,589 --> 00:16:17,810
upset about it and he was like

285
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,399
all but Sarah she said I made a mistake
H

286
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,089
each she made a mistake you know that
she wouldn't do it again and I was like

287
00:16:26,089 --> 00:16:27,350
no no no don't

288
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,410
forgive her you need to break up with
her you know his

289
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:34,339
but she's just done is libelous let era
as a mistake

290
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:38,319
and if she can make that saw a mix-up
with every terminology who knows what

291
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:39,620
else she is capable of

292
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,640
okay that indicted down to you also well
I'm gonna do is help

293
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,050
you be better friends than I am I'm
gonna just give you to fit the

294
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,780
definition between 6 mistakes

295
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,310
so slips these are things that you

296
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:55,020
plan completed correctly in your mind
but then for whatever reason when you

297
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:55,939
execute it

298
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:00,450
it goes horribly wrong so an example of
that is the classic freudian slip

299
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:05,050
way you say one thing you mean one thing
but you say a mother

300
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:09,760
I thought that was a long time

301
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,180
and now a mistake air on the other hand
is where you

302
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:16,459
execute the plan perfectly well but the
plan

303
00:17:16,459 --> 00:17:20,180
be made to begin with was wrong so an
example a mistake era

304
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:24,160
is when you incorrectly let your friend
about era terminology

305
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:28,820
while they're going through severe
emotional trauma like I did just that so

306
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:31,710
is an examples up some Sep some states
let's look at some more

307
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:35,050
examples era using a retiree now

308
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:39,240
wanna my favorite favor air is that we
collect on a retiree

309
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:43,560
is is just so beautiful just so subtle
okay so what we normally trying to do

310
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:46,580
is great isn't it a retiree sometimes we
get there was a

311
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:51,340
era de res coming into things and that
is just so beautiful right

312
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,740
either it means that cows are tweeting
from the workplace

313
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:57,770
ol it means that some people making
hilarious

314
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,780
meta errors about era and I just think
that's beautiful I

315
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:05,629
that's my favorite error that we collect
I don't care what else it says it says a

316
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:07,450
retiree I'm happy air dairy

317
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,660
I'm happy tonight is making a right when
I turned the air dairy

318
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:14,390
I think I did intentional I meant to do
that now let's look at the actual

319
00:18:14,390 --> 00:18:16,530
examples affairs that we collect okay so
they'd

320
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:19,970
they range from the Monday so things
like

321
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:24,280
and people trying to enter use that pin
code for their

322
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,160
ATM cash machine and trying to am but

323
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:32,760
try to put into their Bergeron okay that
is if any straightforward era and its

324
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:33,430
it's something

325
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,930
while learning about their terminology
that is called an associative

326
00:18:36,930 --> 00:18:40,480
action slip okay so they range from the
mundane like this

327
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,790
to the kind of silly an example if
someone

328
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,000
forgetting to remove the cocktail stick
before eating into a burger

329
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,010
thats is an example and omission era

330
00:18:51,010 --> 00:18:54,240
and emission slit they range from the
mundane to the silly

331
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:58,260
to the really really silly this is an
example

332
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:02,070
have someone hurting themselves whilst
air drumming to the eighties pop rock

333
00:19:02,070 --> 00:19:02,500
hit

334
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,580
Africa by Toto that

335
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:08,970
is an example uva sharing too much on
Twitter slip

336
00:19:08,970 --> 00:19:13,000
okay before I go on I just point out
that all of these areas

337
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:16,130
a.m. they would ship these ones just
came from my sister

338
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:19,420
which is a a brilliant way to get around
the ethics is showing the streets in a

339
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,110
show like this

340
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:23,500
and be a pretty way to make fun of my
sister so tick tick it's a win-win

341
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,420
situation

342
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:27,760
now the reason that we collect the slips
is because

343
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:33,530
the thing that make people accidentally
into their paid into a better alarm

344
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:37,030
all make them try and use at least a
card to get into the house

345
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:41,350
these the causes that those areas are
exactly the same

346
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,679
as the cause is a bear that make a a
nurse or a doctor

347
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,790
pram the wrong number into a few pump or

348
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:51,300
makers slip up when they referring to
patients in award

349
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:55,360
and so if we can understand this massive
databases

350
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,790
everyday slips mistakes then maybe we
can kind of

351
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,790
extrapolate from them learn from them
and take that knowledge

352
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:08,010
and apply it to designing interfaces or
designing processes in hospitals

353
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,970
and we can design them to their less
error-prone and said we support the work

354
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:12,470
is more

355
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,740
and help them avoid era from happening

356
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:19,770
so I mean I'm gonna ask you guys to help
out with the researchers have a simple

357
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,350
request

358
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,360
and the next time that you guys make

359
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:26,639
a slip or mistake in the real world and
you're really embarrassed

360
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,810
but no one's around to see it then
please

361
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:33,240
tweet about it and then just add a tag a
retiree

362
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:37,610
and then we can collect it and then we
can all have a massive laugh at your

363
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:38,310
expense

364
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:41,510
am and also like for science

365
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,910
or something

366
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:46,570
whatever am so that's been my set thank
you so much for listening if you

367
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,060
interested in any other types have

368
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,620
information era I don't know what more
to say am my a

369
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,580
to it and let's hope so no era themed so
please like getting

370
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:58,550
in contacts have a chat about things
thank you so much to list their thanks

371
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:05,550
the draft

372
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:11,240
so

373
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:15,670
Sarah mentioned that she works for UCL I
also work for you CLG like the t-shirts

374
00:21:15,670 --> 00:21:20,330
I had I had a meeting with a very senior
man

375
00:21:20,330 --> 00:21:25,649
and a very senior mans said we would
like the university to merchandise

376
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:29,390
more like an American University so my
brain went

377
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:35,130
0 a specific american to divest it that
was great did anyone else think of way

378
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,080
through that though

379
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:40,360
if they're collecting that data of you
tweeting you can just lie

380
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,120
you could ruin it forever you could have
said there is data saying

381
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:47,889
the eighty percent at the errors that
the british public makes

382
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:52,740
all related in some way to toe toes
Africa that would be a paper

383
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,180
that would get in nature just so that
they could get the social media clicks

384
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:56,640
from a

385
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:01,200
it would be brilliant rights we have
another acts his eyes on ex tax: already

386
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,440
Ross wedowee which is double checking
this

387
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:07,620
because I think about your compass is so
much going on we got people it should be

388
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:09,389
arriving and then running on Thursdays

389
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:13,510
a are you all set okay pretty ladies
judge when are you ready to be your

390
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:16,540
second peak show office after

391
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:21,430
the lease my said the rabbi

392
00:22:21,430 --> 00:22:26,870
0 the few

393
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:30,040
gonna here

394
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:37,040
did Kim weird

395
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,800
birth me

396
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:52,409
we mapping rather

397
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:55,890
mapping and

398
00:22:55,890 --> 00:23:00,330
me mapping I'm up organized

399
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:04,000
is an organization Public Library

400
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:07,090
when technology in we do

401
00:23:07,090 --> 00:23:11,220
open source tools for environmental
monitoring

402
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:18,220
share with you wanna to look

403
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,000
I'm

404
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,820
you can see very well ever tell you be
there maybe we should

405
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:35,450
any air photos want DIY

406
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:39,169
and absolute mapping is another way

407
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,570
so you Phillip huge balloon with helium
and you send it

408
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:47,730
up I'm their different ways to attach

409
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,289
your camera to your balloon he can he
was played very well

410
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,470
but here we have I sorta contraction

411
00:23:56,470 --> 00:24:00,149
be cavett and here a bottle

412
00:24:00,149 --> 00:24:04,830
you put Louis your bottle and you put
the camera inside

413
00:24:04,830 --> 00:24:08,320
never take your camera as as you send it
up

414
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:12,470
1,000 feet up in the air and the you
break your after if

415
00:24:12,470 --> 00:24:15,730
in one of the ways to think AB year
pipeline

416
00:24:15,730 --> 00:24:21,220
her balloon line get cut off and your
balloon flights to India or somewhere

417
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:25,210
makin me email you back your camera or
at least you're IndyCar

418
00:24:25,210 --> 00:24:29,629
with your valuable pictures but in an
issue you

419
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:33,678
I'm happy or just a little bit kite
mapping

420
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:38,629
am this and click here

421
00:24:38,629 --> 00:24:42,120
in idea like I and i know i love you
guys

422
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,840
are makers and doers so

423
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,269
miss you review this is Barney really
need

424
00:24:49,269 --> 00:24:53,440
army is I am Pixma and

425
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:58,960
sorry I said tight make height to Delta
kite

426
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,730
really huge it flies and also to win am

427
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,470
it material that is again easy to get

428
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:11,610
festival and it easy to fold a swell

429
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:14,850
so then was really nice n Easy

430
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:16,030
about it

431
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:19,629
he can weekly wrap it up put it in your
backpack

432
00:25:19,630 --> 00:25:24,300
have aspired come apart put it in your
bag and law

433
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:30,950
travel with it so what are the questions
that I get a lot

434
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:35,210
is when we use Skype when you use
balloons I think

435
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:41,420
self-explanatory and also

436
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:44,840
probably balloons are review

437
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,820
if you're gonna do urban mapping if you
can't do more

438
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:54,700
outdoor make out wilderness foreign
oceans you when i use skype

439
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:58,560
am one other problem %uh

440
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,129
using item balloons on like drone in the
have to watch out for power lines but

441
00:26:04,130 --> 00:26:05,060
recently

442
00:26:05,060 --> 00:26:08,960
people have been mapping slums in
Nairobi you know what they do

443
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,460
for power last night in there have the
real

444
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,670
do real family have one here

445
00:26:15,670 --> 00:26:20,190
okay

446
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:24,030
who the real your text you height your
balloon to

447
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:27,440
only got power line well hoops been

448
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,620
and they just throw it over the Caroline

449
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:34,379
and impacted on the other side wouldn't
recommend that because you could lose

450
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:35,700
your kite a balloon

451
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:39,810
but people are amazing people are
ingenious and

452
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:43,490
what other things everyone highlight
about

453
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:46,790
with wave that we in public lab do

454
00:26:46,790 --> 00:26:50,330
I am environmental monitoring and
develop tools

455
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:54,050
for micro-environment learning about I
am i mean

456
00:26:54,050 --> 00:26:58,590
exploring is that we want to define
around inclusion so all the material

457
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,530
are affordable locally sourced
acceptable

458
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:06,920
in very cheap am using each people in a
way that we consider that

459
00:27:06,920 --> 00:27:10,610
everyone have an expertise so welcome
people wanna do

460
00:27:10,610 --> 00:27:14,850
software Park weight involved sexually
working with data

461
00:27:14,850 --> 00:27:18,029
or developing the software better

462
00:27:18,029 --> 00:27:22,249
for their so that we can make different
kind the matter get different kinds of

463
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:26,899
herma other people just wanna do the
actual mapping

464
00:27:26,899 --> 00:27:31,389
other people went to the campaign other
people wanted to the promotion on my god

465
00:27:31,389 --> 00:27:32,080
I cut myself

466
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,749
am so do I show you pictures

467
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:40,799
and we've had lots of fun think mapping
all around the world

468
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,889
so public land community kidnapping is
actually

469
00:27:44,889 --> 00:27:49,158
half-a-million been done by over 3,000
people all around the world

470
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:52,249
so this kind here have been in

471
00:27:52,249 --> 00:27:55,929
Italy yen I'm not gonna brag and EMF
quite

472
00:27:55,929 --> 00:27:59,049
and has been will be fine

473
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:03,408
and now we're gonna give you a
demonstration are on how we attach

474
00:28:03,409 --> 00:28:06,489
the camera to

475
00:28:06,489 --> 00:28:13,489
and the cut so you

476
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:26,480
in

477
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,610
okay I'll take over since we've had a
bit

478
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,059
help blood bar

479
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:57,269
I am this

480
00:28:57,269 --> 00:29:01,610
is called the pic event any sort you can
still see it on the picture behind me

481
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:06,189
it is simply

482
00:29:06,190 --> 00:29:09,980
a platform to hold the camera underneath
the kite when we do cut mapping a lot of

483
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,880
people wonder

484
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:14,669
while lifting near the cameras attached
the kite it's gonna blow all over the

485
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,019
place it's going to be really

486
00:29:16,019 --> 00:29:20,100
there's a lot of turbulence I we don't
actually attach the camera directly to

487
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:20,639
the Chi

488
00:29:20,639 --> 00:29:24,100
reaction it passed a camera crew
platform that is

489
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,820
attacks to the cut line about 50 meters
below

490
00:29:27,820 --> 00:29:31,080
with the kite flies so this means that
you have less turbulence

491
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,449
be if you just attach the camera with a
string you still get a lot of turbulence

492
00:29:35,450 --> 00:29:37,460
and you still get a lot a blurry
pictures

493
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:41,659
so we you something called a peek at
that which is this platform

494
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:45,580
if you can see it in from me here it's
either this purple has a lot of things

495
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,230
going to berry's loops

496
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:52,440
that are attached to to Pisa would
imagine this is there's a line

497
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:56,120
attached here in this line is moving you
can see that the platform

498
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:00,239
is more or less course it's still moving
but it's more stable

499
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,510
finished the camera was attached
directly to the line

500
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:07,610
its call the peak a bit and if you
google that is really simple there are

501
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:10,350
all sorts of animation show how to
string up

502
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,408
all you need is a piece of wood you cut
into shapes you can attach the camera

503
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,889
with with rubber bands

504
00:30:15,889 --> 00:30:19,260
elastics and then I've just attach to

505
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,639
metal loops you know these kind of
screwed loops that you get the hardware

506
00:30:22,639 --> 00:30:23,129
store

507
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:26,409
but if you wanna really fancy P give it
use actual

508
00:30:26,409 --> 00:30:29,779
police because then you get even less
friction

509
00:30:29,779 --> 00:30:34,240
cousin is gonna demonstrate how we
attach the camera

510
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,980
okay so we've just got the camera on

511
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:42,759
attached to a small pad of paper and and

512
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,460
paper towels just two to make it nice
and even

513
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:50,979
a little bit shock absorbent then she's
you see is quite heavy duty elastic

514
00:30:50,979 --> 00:30:51,909
bands

515
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:54,969
and we've got a little on peace ovum

516
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:59,979
tooth-and-nail thats put into the wood
to hold the elastic bands in place

517
00:30:59,979 --> 00:31:03,849
we put in for elastic bands all the way
across

518
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:10,580
and as you'll see in a moment you don't
have to adjust the left

519
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:14,389
the elastic band so the lens can come
out and you can take pictures otherwise

520
00:31:14,389 --> 00:31:17,459
of course you're elastic bands prevent
the camera from

521
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:21,529
from opening up properly but it's really
secure

522
00:31:21,529 --> 00:31:25,499
and on top of it all we've also got this
line here which is a security line which

523
00:31:25,499 --> 00:31:27,499
we attach directly to the cut line

524
00:31:27,499 --> 00:31:30,769
so in case something were to fail with
the peak event

525
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:33,929
the camera will just slide down the cut
line

526
00:31:33,929 --> 00:31:40,639
and you still you can still retrieve it
then what cindy is doing here now is

527
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,519
adjusting the elastic band so the lens
can come out

528
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:48,549
I don't know how well you can see this
in the hold up in the air

529
00:31:48,549 --> 00:31:51,979
you can see the camera is just a touch
the former platform

530
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:57,049
if I turn the camera on the lens can
come out

531
00:31:57,049 --> 00:32:01,359
nice freely take pictures and this is
automatically set

532
00:32:01,359 --> 00:32:04,539
to continuous picture-taking so you
actually

533
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:08,009
rather than controlling what pictures
you're taking your taking a massive

534
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:08,889
pictures

535
00:32:08,889 --> 00:32:12,149
and then sifting through afterwards to
take the nice ones that are not learning

536
00:32:12,149 --> 00:32:13,830
not overexposed and saw

537
00:32:13,830 --> 00:32:17,529
eBay think

538
00:32:17,529 --> 00:32:21,830
the actual mapping and their the way

539
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:25,070
okay to protecting the camera we want to
share this one with you

540
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,700
and will you do with the photos after
dependency can use an early online

541
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:33,999
square magnet being a picture you select

542
00:32:33,999 --> 00:32:38,159
you lose them you don't need you
referencing because you used to be

543
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:39,260
player in the background

544
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:44,230
%uh the program and to align your
pictures so you feel there's a row to

545
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,060
hear that bro

546
00:32:45,060 --> 00:32:49,010
look like this road so %um lightning
menu speech the pictures together you

547
00:32:49,010 --> 00:32:50,980
export your map in multiple formats

548
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,960
you can take your Mac the map being used

549
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,000
in also to form originally was
prototyped

550
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:03,170
for the BP oil spill in 2010 to map to
get public data

551
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:07,450
for the damage to the wetlands and the
shore shorelines and how

552
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:12,030
now within really being and make public
or talked about and the people

553
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,330
whose livelihoods were being affected
couldn't really fee

554
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:19,090
good picture of what extent of the
damage so that was really good

555
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,250
people have been using it for all sorts
of things like for example

556
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,440
had a conflict resolution in israel so
making maps together

557
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:30,720
had between Palestinians and Israeli and
which may be right now would be really

558
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,510
useful but maybe not very possible

559
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:37,420
amber to talk about the sharing up
spaces ankle creation up space

560
00:33:37,420 --> 00:33:40,800
and also been used for disaster relief

561
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,169
and then my mental health and plant
health in farming

562
00:33:46,170 --> 00:33:49,360
et cetera et cetera so get another app

563
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,580
another application is

564
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:56,810
for demonstrations if you've got a large
gathering of people often the media

565
00:33:56,810 --> 00:33:59,770
doesn't quite know what the journalist
don't know how many people were there

566
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:03,320
sinew not given workshops at at these
journalism festivals and their

567
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,710
people a stunning usable that is a
really cheap alternative I don't know

568
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:10,129
I don't member you mention it Cindy this
Tyvek

569
00:34:10,129 --> 00:34:13,830
the material costs for the Skype date
incest into pounds

570
00:34:13,830 --> 00:34:16,850
and the the the

571
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:21,149
rate of course costs about 12 pounds I
believe and not the rig I mean the

572
00:34:21,149 --> 00:34:24,279
real the real the Regus sissy

573
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:27,500
costs nothing it's just piece of wood
and

574
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,790
the camera you can get cameras like this
for Oct 25 pounds

575
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:33,560
so all in all it's a pretty cheap
alternative and the last thing I'll say

576
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,320
is you can see these are the sparse for
the

577
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,700
for the kite you saw me on folding the
kite it folds up nicely I can put in my

578
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:41,529
backpack

579
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:46,020
you literally have a very on a you know
easily portable system for taking re

580
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,310
high quality pictures

581
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:54,130
that you can then upload and share with
people

582
00:34:54,130 --> 00:35:01,130
the for now

583
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:11,440
the good news is we have a first aider
outside a

584
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,300
lol as a nice to see people suffering
for. there are two little bit you know

585
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:19,500
they mean it when they keep going as the
blood sprays everywhere

586
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:23,120
and that was incredible incredible

587
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,350
and we've got one more 10 Keeks to show
off to you

588
00:35:26,350 --> 00:35:30,000
at is currently running outside sorting
Cindy out so I can introduce in a little

589
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:30,250
bit

590
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:34,660
and His Names Rossi looks full at
Bristol which is Big Science Center in

591
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:36,220
Bristol love you got steel slides

592
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:40,160
okay and ross is kind of the big star of
their YouTube channel

593
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,540
so this kids all over the country
watching ross blow things up

594
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:48,050
freeze things and blow some more things
up

595
00:35:48,050 --> 00:35:52,920
I'm not saying is repetitive it's not
lazy judge me ready feel quite ok each

show off in the afternoon

597
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:59,920
though the energy levels are falling is
it's too long since lunch

as intelligent design how nah nah nah

609
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:51,080
0 because and it simmered not since

610
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:55,799
essentially and so we can be taking a
look at the evolution

611
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,020
of various animal

612
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,610
some people would have you believe that
we

613
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:04,700
are the best thats some deities him

614
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:08,120
man Balaban Spaghetti Monster want
whatever you choose

615
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:11,640
we're the best that they could come up
with ans

616
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,819
animals go we we are now we have really
past I me with crap

617
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,370
these pic splashy creatures which the
strange appendages coming of us

618
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:24,529
when you think a beautiful amps really
amazing animals

619
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:28,080
you think things like the Siberian tiger

620
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,230
a majestic wandering through the snow
you might think if

621
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,580
a bird of paradise which to these
amazing Tarsus

622
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:40,160
moving their wings around it icon
accompanied us we suspect that the

623
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,910
the best we can with Christmas just
working it's just embarrassing compared

624
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:44,810
to something like this

625
00:37:44,810 --> 00:37:48,960
kitchens you can't go wrong with a happy
kitten

626
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,790
and I need though

627
00:37:54,790 --> 00:37:58,700
no I cut no I cut to it there's no way I
can compare to something

628
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:02,970
as cute as last tropical fishes Apsley
peace with all these

629
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:07,209
vibrant colors that are there even some
insects you be considered peaceful this

630
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:08,040
is a spider

631
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:12,930
its how cold is bad how funky is back
Wii

632
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:17,330
resemble something little more like this
this

633
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:21,240
his the naked mole rap which basically
just looks like a wrinkly sausage with

634
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,350
legs and teeth

635
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:27,160
and again just that spasm

636
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,540
much closer resemblance that than huh
done with the kitten

637
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,560
so if we wanted to take

638
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,190
the best bits all these different
animals to make and design

639
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:41,540
are own all I wonder what it would look
like a wonder

640
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:44,710
what pic bits and pieces that we could
use we have free rein

641
00:38:44,710 --> 00:38:48,300
to just completely start from scratch
because

642
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:51,780
it's not just our looks that might lead
to stand in the animal kingdom

643
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:55,530
we have absolutely terrible memories we
forget things all the time

644
00:38:55,530 --> 00:38:58,790
a did you know for example that
six-percent

645
00:38:58,790 --> 00:39:04,400
all skydiving fatalities because of
people who forgets to pull the ripcord

646
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,110
justice the parsing we have a man

647
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:11,480
s shakes spine which is very good for
supporting about seventy percent of our

648
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:14,700
body weight allows us to walk around and
Stratton stages like this

649
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,009
because this terrible back pain our eyes
are essentially stop installed inside

650
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:20,530
out with that nerves

651
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:24,320
from the retin-a coming onto the inside
of the eye instead of

652
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,750
back towards our brains the gonna come
act and then in like that

653
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:31,600
because this this brady pointless behind
spartan each of our highest

654
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,130
so let's think about some credits

655
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:39,060
so who want to look at some of the most
powerful and credible Hamels

656
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,779
let's see if we can make a predator
gonna start of with the fastest

657
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:47,780
animal appall the show oh yes this is
all going to be thinking about today so

658
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:51,770
inspired by the sci-fi channel we're
gonna be combining all of these various

659
00:39:51,770 --> 00:39:52,330
things

660
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:56,230
we just saw the cheater to the cheater
can go from

661
00:39:56,230 --> 00:40:01,520
not 269 three seconds it reaches a top
speed of 75 miles an hour which is much

662
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,330
much faster

663
00:40:02,330 --> 00:40:05,380
the new same ball to can do 27 miles an
hour

664
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,350
it's much faster I can do about four
miles an hour has my top speed

665
00:40:09,350 --> 00:40:13,069
so this could easily catch me out there
in the world

666
00:40:13,070 --> 00:40:17,660
so this is going to be our starting
point the majestic cheater we're going

667
00:40:17,660 --> 00:40:18,310
to move on

668
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:22,900
to sure us not think you've shocks
trolls or something like that I'm

669
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,510
thinking of

670
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:27,440
the Nile crocodile because this guy

671
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,610
has one of the most powerful chose the
animal kingdom

672
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:33,850
our up bike forced if you match in
biting the trunk

673
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:37,060
iPhone app that's about a 120

674
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:41,370
pounds per square inch 120 PSI this guy

675
00:40:41,370 --> 00:40:44,819
could do five thousand-page PSI

676
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:48,260
its incredibly powerful so as soon

677
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:52,340
as a cheater has caught you connect now
crop down using the trolls

678
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:56,840
a saltwater crocodile where we going to
go to next well

679
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:59,870
this is demand Sri

680
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:03,020
and this is actually my favorite animal
in the collection

681
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:06,550
his this guy lives in all sorts of
briefs down at the

682
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:10,200
bottom of the sea underneath the water
mysis shrimp

683
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,240
but it looks like it was made in the 70
just got this wonderful tie-dye affect

684
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,879
all over it and

685
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:19,270
one of the most remarkable things about
this animal as its on ice

686
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,900
let's zoom in sick closer looks at these
response now

687
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:26,460
each one of these can move independently
and and i'd

688
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:30,140
any direction seventy degrees all around
to see them both moving around

689
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:33,700
in different directions now we can see
that there's

690
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:38,870
3 areas and the third middle one kind of
goes across the Middle like abante

691
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,279
so we have to ice which covers
binoculars vision allow us to

692
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:47,420
perceive depth in church how far way
things are each

693
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:51,140
one of the mantis shrimp size has try

694
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,150
not kill a vision our ice

695
00:41:54,150 --> 00:41:57,310
also contain things called Color
receptors

696
00:41:57,310 --> 00:42:01,520
so there are brought switched attacked
and movements in

697
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:04,450
cunt blacks and whites and grays and
things like that when you're in a dark

698
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:05,310
room 218

699
00:42:05,310 --> 00:42:09,060
height in a dark room I slowly start
with just using the Broads

700
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:12,250
in your eyes another cone cells which
helps to detect color

701
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:15,310
we have three types account south so
we've got

702
00:42:15,310 --> 00:42:18,940
red blue angry and using all of those we
can see

703
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,320
every single covering for thousands and
thousands of colors everything from

704
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:25,500
beige to top but

705
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:29,000
the mantis shrimp has not three

706
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,300
can cells not four not five but 6

707
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,610
gene different kinds have come cells
this guy

708
00:42:36,610 --> 00:42:39,910
can see colors we can't even imagine
enter ultraviolet

709
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:43,149
an infrared lights this guy can see all
hopes

710
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,920
dreams even though internet history this
absolutely

711
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,550
terrifying so this is what we're going
to be using to see

712
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:53,740
are prey then we move on

713
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,089
to the grizzly bear now the scariest
thing about the grizzly bears night

714
00:42:58,090 --> 00:42:59,140
strike and sexy

715
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:04,029
that we can see here it snows has one of
the most powerful noses in the

716
00:43:04,030 --> 00:43:07,640
animal kingdom help bloodhound consume
any pretty well

717
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:11,730
but the grisly pear has a nose the
seven-time shrunk a

718
00:43:11,730 --> 00:43:15,630
and millions and millions of times
stronger than ours we can text back

719
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:16,760
10,000

720
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,740
different kinds of smell but the grisly
back it smell you

721
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:26,729
from 18 miles away CPB eighty miles away
from this guy and he would still be able

722
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:27,410
to smell you

723
00:43:27,410 --> 00:43:30,830
and not only that beacon smell you
across

724
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:35,390
time this is just insane can you imagine
that

725
00:43:35,390 --> 00:43:38,400
soak if it picks up your scent it can
tell

726
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,840
how far away the you've been where you

727
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:45,590
where and exactly how it's going to
track you a hunt to Janie's in the

728
00:43:45,590 --> 00:43:46,980
census now so even

729
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:50,550
if you can't see you it snows is going
to drop

730
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:53,590
tracking your this

731
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:58,180
is the crates gray al also known as The
Phantom of the notes

732
00:43:58,180 --> 00:44:02,100
school name this is silent death

733
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:05,100
on wearing his because it has

734
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:08,720
the best yes of the animal kingdom in
fact

735
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:11,790
its into higher face axe

736
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,250
like a gigantic here so we have our ites

737
00:44:15,250 --> 00:44:19,600
which help to you pick up the sand and
diverted into RNAs

738
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:24,380
butts his entire face is shaped like a
parabolic dish

739
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:28,760
that focuses that sent and all the Fed
has that covered space known

740
00:44:28,760 --> 00:44:32,040
as a rough now focuses the sound

741
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,890
to it each miss yes so we have two years
on either side of her head

742
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:39,759
and this allows us to pick up what
direction sound is coming from

743
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:43,430
so depending on if the sound is coming
from over there is gonna hit

744
00:44:43,430 --> 00:44:47,220
my left ear before hits while right my
brain is pretty clever it's able to

745
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:48,009
figure X

746
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:52,120
timing between those two things in tel
me a brief idea of where its

747
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,850
but it's useless if something's coming
at you from

748
00:44:55,850 --> 00:44:59,259
dead-on what they're behind because it
hurts but your years at the same time

749
00:44:59,260 --> 00:45:02,730
to the Owls overcome this by having
asymmetrical years what is

750
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,420
ever so slightly higher in Fort it
always has a slightly lower

751
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:10,210
so how effective is

752
00:45:10,210 --> 00:45:14,050
the ES a great gray owl well it can
detect the beetle

753
00:45:14,050 --> 00:45:16,140
hidden in the grass

754
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:19,770
about a hundred yards wager scurrying
around it can hear the squeak

755
00:45:19,770 --> 00:45:22,770
a mouse hoff a mile away

756
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:26,330
that's just incredible and then it's
swoops down

757
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:30,990
from the trees landing on its prey
catching it with its talents

758
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:34,629
to the next time you see an alcove Bobby
gets hurt

759
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,170
ran like this looks very cute what it's
doing theirs

760
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:42,780
honing in on its prey to get exact

761
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:46,250
mock to a concert with Dan I get a meal

762
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:49,400
this

763
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,620
hasten star nosed mole and

764
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,000
it looks kind of a cross between
Wolverine with some clothes here

765
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,490
and a plushie toy that's just been
squeeze really hard so

766
00:45:59,490 --> 00:46:03,250
you so we called it insights coming out
of its face

767
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,020
but its nose is absolutely

768
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,850
incredible switch able to kinda it's a
combination of touch

769
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:14,990
and tastes similar painlessly and it's
the fastest

770
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:20,020
eating animal in the world his this
knows has a back twenty

771
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:24,120
of these tentacles all around it and
that covered in these tiny tiny little

772
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:24,799
dots called

773
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:29,150
I miss organs and using these I miss
organs its freely around underneath the

774
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:29,600
ground

775
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,040
its I size incredibly poor sprint
replied it just uses

776
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:36,529
his nose stuffy around underneath the
grant miss looking

777
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,140
for a meal but as it feel something

778
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,810
in 10th a second it decides whether to
eat it

779
00:46:43,810 --> 00:46:48,320
or not is going on mad mad mad mad mad
mad mad mad mad mad world mad mad mad

780
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:49,020
mad mad what

781
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:52,400
it does incredibly quickly even as as

782
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:56,570
underwater it's so fast that edge X is
little apples into the water

783
00:46:56,570 --> 00:47:00,230
so that can taste what underneath the
water

784
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:03,250
before then borrow Smackdown underneath
the ground

785
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:07,830
absolutely incredible I'm going over 10

786
00:47:07,830 --> 00:47:10,840
to the mantis shrimp because this has
another feature

787
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:14,440
just even cooler minutes ice because

788
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:18,130
once are predators smelled your head
you're so you act

789
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:21,390
we to give it a weapon and this creature
has

790
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:25,170
the best weapon in the entire animal
kingdom

791
00:47:25,170 --> 00:47:29,120
see might be able to see just around
here is got these ok back to real

792
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,640
appendages go a little bit like this his
even though

793
00:47:32,640 --> 00:47:36,720
this guy looks very peaceful very
harmonious

794
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,930
like I said it's like he's been design
in the seventies so

795
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:44,140
you might imagine him car coming along
and splitting up some fun snowman

796
00:47:44,140 --> 00:47:49,420
who just want to live in peace just be
like me just embrace the conner is still

797
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:50,580
around

798
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:55,819
not known in another this I aquariums

799
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,940
dome half use because

800
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,700
they Cahill everything else

801
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:08,299
in the czech so it goes along and
instead of breaking up the fight

802
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:11,650
just goes what if we just what a
three-time

803
00:48:11,650 --> 00:48:15,530
and he's back to morial appendages fling
acts smashing

804
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,640
whatever's in front of it they
accelerate 23

805
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:24,589
meters per second that's the same speed
as a bullet coming from a .22-caliber

806
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:25,220
rifle

807
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:30,290
and it hits its target with 1500

808
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:34,650
Newton's a force to give you some idea
of just

809
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:39,520
how much that is if we were able to
throw a ball at a baseball

810
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,160
with one 10th of that force

811
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:46,490
we could throw that ball into orbit

812
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,120
ass it moves these back to real
appendages forwards

813
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,250
it's going so fast but it instantly

814
00:48:54,250 --> 00:48:57,810
boils the water in front of it creating
a shockwave

815
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:01,110
nah shockwave is powerful enough to kill
its prey anyway

816
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:05,390
2x celebrates forward to the shock wave
then it creates something called a

817
00:49:05,390 --> 00:49:06,890
cavitation bubble

818
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:11,060
she's a bit like a vacuum as the water
gets pushed guys in front of it

819
00:49:11,060 --> 00:49:14,490
as the vacuuming collapses back down one
of these tiny bubbles

820
00:49:14,490 --> 00:49:18,540
it creates temperatures up thousands of
degrees Kelvin

821
00:49:18,540 --> 00:49:20,390
his much hotter than even purse

822
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:24,359
surface of the Sun as the bubbles then
collapse the and Mitch

823
00:49:24,359 --> 00:49:28,799
lights in a strange process that no one
really understands we call it saw no

824
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:32,490
luminescence has pretty terrifying

825
00:49:32,490 --> 00:49:35,558
so we've learned about all of these

826
00:49:35,559 --> 00:49:38,950
different ways that animal skin catch
their prey or

827
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:43,759
even Beach up when it finds it but would
you guys like to see

828
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:48,380
the perfect animal if we combined all of
these different things

829
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:52,569
into a single creature to terrify s

830
00:49:52,569 --> 00:49:58,319
for the rest of our lives because let's
see it every game

831
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:02,509
settlement if there was such a thing as

832
00:50:02,510 --> 00:50:06,730
intelligent design we would live in a
world that would be

833
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:10,099
dominated by creatures like this and it
would be

834
00:50:10,099 --> 00:50:13,319
absolutely terrified thank you

835
00:50:13,319 --> 00:50:20,319
I've been ross thank you very much

836
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:25,950
sex in today's it's just so yeah

837
00:50:25,950 --> 00:50:29,078
the jolts have nightmares

838
00:50:29,079 --> 00:50:33,380
at those if you've enjoyed the show
we're gonna be back 8:30 tonight

839
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:38,400
doing another key show of where I will
be for all Harley hammered by the time

840
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,640
it starts

841
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:42,839
so that's going to be quite exciting
thank you you've been an amazing journey

842
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,650
it's collateral calls for everyone the
scene so hard

843
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:48,779
the say

844
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,670
the
