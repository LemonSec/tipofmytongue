1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,219
I que se next up we have a man with a
very lovely shirts

2
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,070
s varied appalachia

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:19,359
which is convenient because he's talking
about I am automated

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:26,359
knitting machines and his name is Tom
Myers p but

5
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:32,480
hi everybody and then my shirts as high
as well and

6
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:36,828
3d printers are really really cool and
really really for testing technology

7
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,879
at has that capability to fundamentally
disrupt and such as manufacture

8
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,210
a.m. I think they're really cool but and
the problem

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:47,570
at least personally I see with them -ism
that they don't

10
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:51,479
I don't make things that ordinary people
want like this and testicular heck space

11
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:55,019
we need engineering parts and custom
made still things for their only so many

12
00:00:55,019 --> 00:00:56,140
studies have yoder

13
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:59,650
that ordinary people I want and need in
their in their lives

14
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,030
and I 13 points to be as good as
possible I think

15
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,060
which design 3d printers and to make
things that are more and useful to

16
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,119
ordinary people things that people will
use a lot more in their everyday lives

17
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:13,360
and and so I've been have been doing
just that

18
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,280
and I've been building a 3d printer that
makes clothes and I'm afraid I don't

19
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,680
have it and with me on stage I was
planning to

20
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:23,200
and its it in my tent at the moment but
saturated freed up in the make this

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,190
village last night

22
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,890
and unfortunately it it collapsed part
partly so that sentiment is broke

23
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:32,370
so i cud shitty today but I do have them
a photo of course

24
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,799
am yeah I don't know if you can see it

25
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,810
am better a there it is

26
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:45,770
perhaps more importantly am I have some
examples are the things that can make

27
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,990
and this is i dinna I mean if you can
see

28
00:01:48,990 --> 00:01:52,360
I'll switch to the appropriate slight

29
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,369
but im with tiny limits jumper

30
00:01:55,369 --> 00:01:57,850
I'm

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,390
year with a few went with a few mistakes

32
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:03,400
a.m. ok made

33
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:08,340
a.m. a this this does have demonstrates

34
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:12,430
and what what this machine is capable of
and what would I was designing it to do

35
00:02:12,430 --> 00:02:13,010
which is

36
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,090
essentially to be at a complete
3-pointer that makes

37
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:20,280
and complete clothes and in a single
step from

38
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,700
from nothing at from it from and your
from

39
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,470
will or cotton or various other things
and

40
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:31,260
as I as I say makes metzger's in a
complete step you'll see

41
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:34,790
there now seems all stitching any kind
on the on the sides

42
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:38,739
or at the all on the sleeves

43
00:02:38,739 --> 00:02:43,440
and mess because the way it made its all
business together in a single

44
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,739
I'm a single step and M yeah as a
consequence

45
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,319
its it it it is very much a 3d printer
that that makes clothes

46
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:54,630
and a total about how it couldn't hurt
can am

47
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,769
knits has admitting she bid I actually I
don't I don't particularly like the

48
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:00,010
committee should I prefer

49
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:03,489
soft protests a three different mix of
things it's of printer

50
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,810
because it can it can weave as well as
Mitt and had evidence for this

51
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:13,160
am this is it's it's it's a it's very
small it's nice to be demonstration that

52
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,260
the other one but its system

53
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:17,540
this is a little piece dem and showing

54
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:21,150
and that that there was also made a
machine that's that's a woven fabric

55
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:22,109
rather than admitted one

56
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:25,489
I'm I should be one study that there are
two major ways

57
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,040
from making clothes and industry

58
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,260
and knitting and weaving at both

59
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:35,459
are that weaving is when you take

60
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,590
to reserve vertical threats and then
interlock

61
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,090
I'm horizontal ones next to the maloom
you just keep doing that i sometimes you

62
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,709
end up with them

63
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:45,859
sheet if ever you can cut that out enter
states that together

64
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:50,100
and knitting is similar Alex been a
little detox it will select how the

65
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:51,108
machine works

66
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:55,040
and got a video here an

67
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,340
it's just me explaining

68
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:02,739
how it works committee something between
the talking

69
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:07,349
I don't know how you can see a.m. China

70
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:11,099
after after putting it out but also have
to pause it so i'm concerned. moving

71
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:15,130
back and forth between the two and this

72
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,190
the two-level

73
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,029
bring to the front and flee without
breaking it

74
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,190
is one of the bed to the machine and

75
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:28,550
you see how you've got a long series
these needles

76
00:04:28,550 --> 00:04:32,580
and equally spaced along its and

77
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,020
and that they will hold the government
in place

78
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:40,380
so and now thanks yeah

79
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,590
assist hold this they keep

80
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:48,000
okay good management

81
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,760
'em CC got a whole series the Zam these
loops and it held about a 45 degree also

82
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,440
the almost angle he's holding actually

83
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,139
'em and date these these people moving
up and down

84
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,350
I'm like this and then there's a
loophole in each one too few

85
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:07,440
committed that to say conceded thing now
a.m.

86
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,680
CC and you got a loop

87
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,950
a fabric held on each one of those hooks
I'm

88
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:17,190
and images held down by some way to
consider the bottom

89
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:21,539
be and and the needle moves forwards

90
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,860
did well you can see this the loose
forwards and then there's a little much

91
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:31,810
hmm which sheet which is she on here

92
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:35,620
you see 'em as good looking as we left
here DM

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,419
because we've had an issue getting Ted

94
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:44,020
ok 'em is it is little let's hear

95
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:48,520
which and for you with which the need
which the

96
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,940
luper fabric is over and past and then
you feat in New

97
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,710
I'm a new piece of fabric through the
hook and M

98
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:59,820
that creates new stitch as you're about
to see in the video am

99
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:03,800
you can see the new stitch forming a in
a moment

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:08,210
just there and that creates a new luper
fabric

101
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:12,419
and and that you keep doing over and
over again and two crew Los Lupes a

102
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,540
fabric and consequently whole government

103
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,660
am a message he had machine works in
them in this video I'm doing everything

104
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:19,770
by hand

105
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:23,330
am but it's just as easy to do it using
them

106
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,659
a carriage that move forward and back on
the bed and has mangled sides that

107
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,090
pushed the thing up is a good person
pushed down again

108
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:33,760
and and essentially how you you do this
autonomously

109
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,539
and like I was hoping that movement

110
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,780
the presentation now your

111
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:45,289
I'm

112
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:48,680
be it's meant to be blank I'm its

113
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:52,460
a.m. so a what what is this technology
and keep love

114
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,200
in and completely well a.m. it's
basically

115
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,219
its and is key for making complete
clothes have said

116
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,050
is a key from doing pockets and various
other fancy things

117
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:08,040
and embroidery things like that a rule
I'm coral doable with things like this

118
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,710
what it can't do and perhaps obviously
-ism the car it doesn't have any buttons

119
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:15,950
forum was it think that that is dead
their heart econ

120
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,360
consciousness together there she was run
that the simplest being just to get the

121
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,720
user to sew them on for you

122
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,100
and but not at the murder numerous trips
with his little quit

123
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:27,910
and the other important thing a.m. about
this technology

124
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,530
-ism making is Stacy Nichols closely as
possible so in

125
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,270
in the machine I have and which you
should we she saw and

126
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:39,200
for making this the needles were quite
far part they were about many centimeter

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,050
apart from each other

128
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:43,540
and that means you have to make and
chunky comments like this

129
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:47,180
am obviously that's not ideal would much
rather make

130
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,930
seen things cuz that's what most clothes
made of and

131
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:54,050
into the way you do that is instead of
having them

132
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,200
but since we trip I just have them some
like a millimeter part

133
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,409
now that is this definitely feasible and
I have

134
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:04,210
examples if needles here which er 33 and
40 microns

135
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,310
wide battered millimeter very very im
very very thin needles that

136
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,500
that can accommodate a.m. being space
very closely and

137
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:15,010
consequently making really high-quality
fabrics the hard part is actually

138
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:18,710
and aligning them together in a bit like
it when you saw and you can't really do

139
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:21,530
analytic cuts like I made that bed with
because the resolution

140
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:25,090
that with beams about 150 microns and

141
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:29,599
which is which at me too busy running at
the resolution limit if the machine

142
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,490
at the at the laser cutter am p

143
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:36,990
to what you that's the the way do in
cities you have you the book value in a

144
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:39,770
very thin circular saw reach cut the
group one by one

145
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,960
which means have to do have a hand in
its tiring but its is possible is the

146
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,410
point

147
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,569
and that as a consequence is that it and
in the future will be able to make

148
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:51,450
a.m. really high-quality fabrics am you

149
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,250
you know continue Thomas Lee a circle

150
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:58,960
the term why would Wiley weldon the next
version of

151
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:03,580
answer is that why would an a user what
any of this and so we we already have

152
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:06,680
a fashion industry a.m. thats

153
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,420
that's very functional we will use it
and what why would we need to

154
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,979
change it by a.m. designing these
machines a contest to make the cont

155
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,520
3 deeply we can custom a close with a
few punches the first -ism

156
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:21,069
is the fact is custom made me to be
fitted much more easily

157
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,720
and so when you making these in China
and the Far East too long to touch it

158
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,650
it's really hard to

159
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:29,410
do anything they didn't small medium
large busy making it in your own home or

160
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,579
very close to your own home

161
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:34,190
and is pretty easy to him to simply

162
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,880
at take somebody's and size that waste
the waist size

163
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,550
and heights and so on input that into
the machine take the design

164
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:44,880
map that's too your tickets beckon and
custom make it to you

165
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,750
but in your home am that's that's very
feasible with this in nineteen it means

166
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,620
a close it makes will fit better than
any

167
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,970
you'll find on that have been
mass-produced and

168
00:09:53,970 --> 00:09:57,490
second-largest speed a.m. the

169
00:09:57,490 --> 00:10:01,630
freshen up BC moves and changes quickly
and it's really beneficial to be able to

170
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:02,140
him

171
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,230
move quickly along with it and and

172
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:09,200
that is very special houses have heavily
tied to their manufacture vary between

173
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,959
seven and nine weeks test

174
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,619
have six months and has a huge amount of
time to wait to bring in a new design

175
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:18,889
was with this and we would need is
fashion design to design something

176
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:19,579
upload it

177
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:22,939
you could pay them small amount download
it and make it

178
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,350
really really easily and not much will
quickly learn to stay

179
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:29,480
onto fashion trends is also really good
for fashion designers

180
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,839
because and at the moment if you wanna
make any kind of fashion line at all you

181
00:10:32,839 --> 00:10:33,510
have to him

182
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:39,029
is this an initial outlay to him his
initial out later to making any such as

183
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:39,339
to

184
00:10:39,339 --> 00:10:42,839
a gifted be fairly confident you can
sell it snows make profit

185
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:46,290
was with its and just upload the design
online if one person makes

186
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,349
you've already made a profit there's no
wastage there's no loss allows people to

187
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,329
be a lot more experimental created with

188
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,500
with their designs can take risks if
things don't succeed

189
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,440
and did fine but she's ethics

190
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,510
a.m. to obviously love the clothes you
find in the heist you know the clothes

191
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:02,760
that

192
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:05,930
we wear and wood made in very ethical
conditions

193
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:09,329
in a low wages cramped long hours and so
on and

194
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,130
in this absolutely guarantees that is
going to happen X is made right there in

195
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:13,660
front of you

196
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:19,560
and so thats it to ethically Israel a
mathematical suppress the fashion

197
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:20,180
industry

198
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:23,579
into into improving their intended as a
viable competitor

199
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:27,779
the term that doesn't have any these
ethical issues that they have and

200
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:32,110
your to own finances to talk about what
other technologies exist

201
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,810
and clearly this is this doesn't exist
in a vacuum I didn't just invent all

202
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:36,859
this from scratch

203
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:42,579
a.m. be its lotta love this technology
and existed in the seventies and

204
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:44,880
eighties infirmities these all the teams
sheen's

205
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,160
and got ever got more more sophisticated

206
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,040
and up until until mid eighties I think
and

207
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,050
when when it when it beat minute and
then made listening to the minute they

208
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:56,640
eventually

209
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,410
and stop in the 360 it eventually
stopped

210
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:03,519
which Israel shake their getting very
close to building what I want to build

211
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,310
that which is a completely autonomous
she

212
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,699
I have and this which is made on a
machine

213
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:14,620
in there in our local hack spaceship
will make space thank you

214
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,210
a.m. at this

215
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:21,350
a.m. and the Machine this was made on
has most the compd most important

216
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:22,180
components

217
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,469
and that I want from this Soham its duck

218
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:29,610
by the back strictly hello and another
audience member

219
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:33,520
a.m. so you live streaming feed for you
in Cedar

220
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,569
a.m. so

221
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:40,540
am gonna say yeah the technology exists
as existed for a long time to be taught

222
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,640
on a misty meetings

223
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,300
with the the machine this is made it was
all the bits were connected together

224
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,410
at the merger electronic and middle
section had the

225
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:51,990
computer and so on but there was an
incident research download and move

226
00:12:51,990 --> 00:12:52,740
designs

227
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,980
and to just wasn't particularly it was
ready for its time now of course candy's

228
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,830
so much too much faster more
sophisticated everybody's got its that

229
00:12:59,830 --> 00:13:00,720
makes devices

230
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,340
coming out in areas and it's far far
easier to him

231
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:08,910
design things like and is far far is it
it to make an shed designs into

232
00:13:08,910 --> 00:13:12,589
an autonomous machinists p.m. be far
more powerful

233
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:16,440
and is also based heavily on the open
the project which many females

234
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,200
already heard of and that's that's a
project to to build something very much

235
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,560
like this and an open society she
essentially

236
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,459
a.m. the only and even with that I have
i mean a lot to this

237
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:29,810
this design it and she have here is
based on the open it is based on that

238
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:30,579
network

239
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:35,840
but i wanna really go beyond open it am
in today they only seem to want to make

240
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:40,080
and panel anything she skip love making
willie jumpers I wanted to make a

241
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:40,620
knitting she

242
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:44,270
to do everything and with and the
weaving technology option with the

243
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:48,560
much and high-resolution closely spaced
Neil dismal its I'm and

244
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,939
I believe it's its and possible to do
that and

245
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:55,540
your thats that the end is them

246
00:13:55,540 --> 00:13:58,579
much would have left him lesson time for
two questions

247
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:02,630
and in case you didn't understand any
but I said which is quite likely given

248
00:14:02,630 --> 00:14:02,950
how

249
00:14:02,950 --> 00:14:07,060
Ramli I am and leaving Mike coming
rancher

250
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:14,060
people and issue

251
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,150
there

252
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:24,550
to can you explain how you'll stitch
making it different from a traditional

253
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:25,829
knitting machine

254
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:29,280
and the stage making is indifferent and
not in terms of

255
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,510
when I wanna do in it and its is the
same process

256
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:36,750
meetings always been the same a.m. and
yet the

257
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,140
the only difference is I want to weave I
have to used if a technique

258
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,290
and which involves lovely transfers and
things

259
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:50,290
the cat with the meeting is essentially
the same process here

260
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,720
you and

261
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:59,350
so how do you I model the clothes by I'm
thinking to saint repinned disease

262
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:02,610
something I hope in US cattle something
had how do you do that for

263
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,770
for the I'm whether a few ways and it's
actually not at the point yet worth had

264
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,689
where been able to

265
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:11,520
create a fully model clothes and a it's
still early push to have got to the

266
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,380
stage for any to

267
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:15,490
I can get a fully modeled I took
clothing and put it in

268
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,700
but and in terms as this resistance and

269
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:22,490
the you probably and hasn't an XML file
coding

270
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:25,620
this this is one loop in these two more

271
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,790
and include that in you could you could
go as far as say

272
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:32,839
its specify where each stitch is
supposed to be and telling its tits tits

273
00:15:32,839 --> 00:15:33,860
tits tits tits there

274
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,040
is this a question lives with sexually
to go you could the

275
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,270
let slip and complete machine code to
very abstract

276
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,250
and justice the general outline still
worst still to be mapped onto

277
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:51,250
a person's body yeah

278
00:15:52,510 --> 00:15:55,130
and thats looks like it's really

279
00:15:55,130 --> 00:15:58,540
to plan things joined at the edges yet
can you do to

280
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,910
three-dimensional shaping it general way
or

281
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:06,219
is it really a up thing onto the streets
kinda to flattens connected

282
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:10,480
a.m. the machine looks like this and
ceases to flatbeds

283
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,530
oppose each other said is always an
element of

284
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,860
and to flashings but I think you can be
you can be

285
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:20,450
at the tricks even if you and there
there was a chance you can do to try to

286
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,250
mitigate that

287
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:25,030
by maybe making seems diagonal rather
than straight to a thing

288
00:16:25,030 --> 00:16:30,079
and yet but is no fundamental way that
that's the same problem you have

289
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,820
with normal clothes anyway that the two
flat things in together and

290
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:36,910
said its it's not is a massive
improvement it still

291
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:40,500
a bit of an improvement %um to never
still s see many more

292
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:45,520
year

293
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,579
are you familiar with net ml no I'm not

294
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:51,990
it's a meeting language based

295
00:16:51,990 --> 00:16:55,220
on XML okay and that goal that this
would be

296
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,540
that it's a universal language yet so
that I can

297
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:03,069
write a pattern in the NL and someone
say in Brazil

298
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,490
K yet and they wouldn't need to I don't
speak Portuguese

299
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:10,690
yet and they only speak English and we
could exchange patterns knitting pattern

300
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:11,010
yes

301
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,210
through this medium and I'm thinking

302
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:17,250
that might be yet that awaited

303
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:20,740
yet they'll be good with answer her
question yeah that lead how you

304
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,220
the area how you created by man on that
is that you need the programming

305
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,740
language it speaks knitting

306
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,320
yes as a sense that the plan is she
still a prototype haven't got tested yet

307
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:29,590
that

308
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,350
I can revelry when I did sir are you on
Ravelry no I'm not

309
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:36,590
okay we'll talk right hey Fisher

310
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:40,480
okay yet again

311
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:45,440
say

312
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,500
you I'm I A the hand knitting

313
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,610
I'm have both leave attachments

314
00:17:51,610 --> 00:17:55,810
I'm afraid I'm afraid I don't do hand
knitting so we're

315
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:58,760
it might be different I like to see look
at the clothes they wear this is

316
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,560
obviously

317
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:04,840
is then net fabric but yeah you do not
want this treacherous leave to be the

318
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:08,870
same direction as the stretch of your
body part needs to go down the sleeves

319
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:13,040
saying I'll any thoughts yet

320
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,720
I'm should answer is No but at the

321
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:21,240
it's very versatile machine is a lot of
and is not a clever tricks you can do

322
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:21,760
with it

323
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:25,230
it is different to hand it in quite a
few ways a.m.

324
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:28,540
that in in general you can and you can
usually get around

325
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:31,780
a.m. yet get around quite a lot of stuff
by doing things in

326
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:37,899
in unusual ways which took good

327
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,000
yeah Jim Christian

328
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:43,309
maybe you could give

329
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:46,490
more fully fleshed-out example wanna

330
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,590
unusual ways I can't imagine how you
would make like

331
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:52,730
a shirt with a pocket because it has
ordered two cavities ok it will one way

332
00:18:52,730 --> 00:18:54,760
to do it maybe there's another example
that word

333
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,740
I think that the ship to ship the book
is good example actually when we're

334
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,640
doing that would be

335
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,809
and insanity or all of the needles unit
haha of

336
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:05,240
treats bit seen it alternate needles 181
not

337
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:08,800
each way and that increases the space in
between meals obviously fifties really

338
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,190
low

339
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:12,559
really love spacing to start with once
you've done that got half the needle

340
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,490
spirits one

341
00:19:13,490 --> 00:19:17,140
Soham once you get pockets you then
starts

342
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:20,690
and the NIT forward back feel luper the
thing

343
00:19:20,690 --> 00:19:23,890
then you go back to the news we want
pocket you do another stitch

344
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:27,720
just along with the remaining needles
that haven't been that you didn't use to

345
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,630
to make the %um

346
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,610
thing by only using Hough do that for a
few roads make sure is joined at the

347
00:19:32,610 --> 00:19:33,110
ends

348
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:37,129
by M perhaps combining wilson et pics to
doing one row like this

349
00:19:37,130 --> 00:19:40,970
and in the next like that ending rent
which one and

350
00:19:40,970 --> 00:19:44,309
that would mean that the pocket was
connected to the whole thing and then

351
00:19:44,309 --> 00:19:47,840
and keep doing that to you stopped in
the pocket and then just go back to

352
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,260
meeting that the shirt from their own

353
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,550
I'm not sure that's a very clear
explanations misses me with my hands but

354
00:19:53,550 --> 00:20:00,550
it is possible a pocket certainly

355
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,130
your any other questions that became
cool
