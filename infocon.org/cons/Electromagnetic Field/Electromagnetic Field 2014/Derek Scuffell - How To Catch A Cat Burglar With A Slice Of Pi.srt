1
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:12,299
a Kate so

2
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,750
this is really am kinda screwed so let's
do it

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,840
can we all just if you that's on the
screens to stand up companies load space

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:20,430
here

5
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,220
a suck up love it's a video to show and

6
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,650
when the Sun comes out it's very
difficult to say so just come a bit

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:27,430
closer

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,400
and a what we actually have here is not
a problem it's an opportunity

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:36,780
to can meet some other people don't
don't don't hang at the back back on

10
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:38,870
this loads of fun going on down here

11
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,870
that's it just made a little bit closer
okay

12
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:50,910
no problem alright well and will manage

13
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:55,398
my own other art will come due in
Braille describe

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:02,399
what's on the screen thanks

15
00:01:04,010 --> 00:01:07,920
a cake in your say can he make a thanks
very much doing that and

16
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,130
apologies for the for the glitch there
so my name starts with L

17
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:15,190
I I am mad just go talk about

18
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,929
um some stuff that I've done trying to
one project tonight kinda deviated often

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:20,440
found in

20
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,280
wanna to other interesting things that
going on around the house

21
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,740
and just give you and a very I just
wanna kinda setlist set the same here

22
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:32,830
and on I know no electronics am

23
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:36,390
and I know no electronics because I'm on
a biologist really

24
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:40,259
and so I I'd agricultural physiology and
crop protection

25
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:43,789
and I this %uh the bottom left

26
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:47,610
picture here on the screen is is kinda
corn growing in poly tunnels that we

27
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,289
check in on

28
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,929
I work with a lot of data to do with
experiments that come out of that so

29
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:55,240
I really do electronics by any means and
and

30
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:58,759
the other thing that I've that is
relevant to this at the not

31
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:02,070
a recently made knowing is I've been
doing some welding

32
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,720
and on the bottom right there again i I
had to come to describe it to you but

33
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:06,450
it's an

34
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,720
this is a three bottles and beer

35
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:12,910
which I gave to my neighbor's Sun when

36
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:17,410
he reached 18 years old but I welded the
mall into a steel case

37
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,220
so the only way he get into it was
trashy take an angle grinder a hacksaw

38
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,790
to it

39
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:25,870
if he actually wanted a drink appear am

40
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,940
so that it is effect yes a break the
bottle

41
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,530
and its teasingly made to look as if you
can just take the bottle out but

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,049
actually

43
00:02:34,049 --> 00:02:38,150
when you try and you you fun at Cardiff
so

44
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,820
the SI my background is that every
inning Electronix and

45
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,850
I just became very interested in the
last reply actually my son don't want

46
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,570
for Christmas is also want to Christmas

47
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,920
I am my son's quite old actually
families 23

48
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,760
a term and I i think is very interesting
but

49
00:02:54,760 --> 00:03:01,100
term a bone upton's a background
understanding why we actually needed to

50
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:02,090
transfer pilot

51
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:05,109
with really resonated with me on
different from the generation that

52
00:03:05,109 --> 00:03:07,140
couldn't afford a BBC Micro

53
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,708
but you know did use one use friends
ones in a dealer programming a bits and

54
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:13,319
pieces with that and I think that

55
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:14,399
term

56
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,190
yeah i i totally understand his

57
00:03:17,190 --> 00:03:21,040
his statements about or understanding
that the number graduate also

58
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,890
potential graduates are applying for
courses who actually have an

59
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:27,369
understanding computer sciences declined
in decline declined in the UK

60
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:30,420
and has been a real shame that's not
necessarily

61
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,798
gonna set as well for the future it's
not really things are gonna build our

62
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:35,790
computer science capabilities in the UK

63
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,209
and and you know with national
curriculum is being followed

64
00:03:39,209 --> 00:03:42,230
the Excel

65
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,929
thing how to do prayer power point
presentations and has to excel

66
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,079
is not really the thing's gonna push for
the frontiers for us so

67
00:03:49,079 --> 00:03:53,519
I think cam you know that there are two
pies just a brilliant brilliant

68
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,099
a phenomena the that's come about and i
i'd

69
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:00,670
I never cease to be amazed by these
projects and this

70
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:04,108
I mean everyone knows this one with
damage the band am

71
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:07,980
in with a have signed up to describe the
pictures were gonna sit sons come out

72
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,238
but

73
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,109
am I'm to my baggage the bear the the
project to

74
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:16,600
but the recreates and Felix
Baumgartner's jump from outer space but

75
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,579
using a teddy bear

76
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,709
around 3pi in a total budget three
hundred pounds

77
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:26,110
whereas sir the nasa budget for Felix
Baumgartner's budget was $30 million

78
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,470
and but you know it's just will rice on
one for the open source crowd to

79
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,120
actually

80
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,380
actually do that and United

81
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,280
the school projects the seats are
occupied I think you're amazing as well

82
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,840
as just really great ideas that they
come up with CAP feeders

83
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:46,330
pill dispensers lap timers sports
equipment all powered by round trip I

84
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,310
projects so

85
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:51,000
I found that really interesting and I i
10 do

86
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,820
I'm Chung FAI little things that I can
do around the house among other things

87
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:59,599
again I'm gonna have to skip to lead the
Suns come as been cloudy only

88
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,750
arms are described to stay on the right
hand side here

89
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:06,340
in this blank piece if they're screen is

90
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:10,369
a Paula builders de Bry which has been
dumped

91
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,449
on a byway near our near where I live

92
00:05:13,449 --> 00:05:17,260
and friend mine is the estate manager
for a number farms

93
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,229
around here and this fly-tipping occurs
is Sam

94
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:25,039
is a real pain is real pain to him
because he he's the land

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,610
has to clear all this up and it's a real
pain or city environment this

96
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:35,330
that poisons and toxins are in there and
some cases as asbestos is left behind

97
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,740
and and in those particular cases that
the local

98
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,930
am authority have to come along clear it
up

99
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:47,170
but at the landowner is the one who is
mostly responsible for doing that and

100
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,370
them it's a real it's a real pain and
this happens you know as soon as spring

101
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,040
come

102
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:54,160
people do house clean outs phil has
become a lot more active

103
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,160
and and this occurs an awful lot and
it's a real

104
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,530
a real nuisance um so a

105
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:04,219
just this is a kind in a pub
conversation often happens that with me

106
00:06:04,220 --> 00:06:05,220
on a Friday night

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:08,410
talking to friends and still couldn't we
do around 3pi projects

108
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,440
to see if we could detect the presence

109
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,830
author fly tippers or perhaps capture an
image or see if we can recognize in some

110
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,180
way

111
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,130
and are unitary authority the where I
come from

112
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:25,200
what their response to this is that they
will rummage through the day brain if

113
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,770
they can

114
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:29,460
find a piece of paper or somewhere
identifying the culprits

115
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,090
then the most they will do his rights
the maleta

116
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:36,489
and say we think you dropped something
would you like to come pick it up

117
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,000
am and that my friend his the local
state managers now part

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,900
a National Farm awareness group which
has a local

119
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,590
a local meeting this now chaired by a
cantankerous

120
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:52,489
and police official whose fail in its
retirement and he's at the opinion if

121
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:53,030
you just

122
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:56,989
for me anyway I'm identifying who these
people are election is gonna rest them

123
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,680
which would be a lot more effective than
writing the letter so

124
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:04,430
with that as background we think will
that could be to apply project that

125
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,110
would help us

126
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:08,620
try and identify and his light it is our

127
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,820
now I'm just gonna say expectations now
by the into this talk

128
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:15,500
I'm not going to identified any fly
tippers because this talk is actually

129
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,669
how I got slightly distracted from this
project

130
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:21,529
doing other things so a.m. but you know

131
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:24,409
watch this space and it is actually a
little bit of the plagues I have hit a

132
00:07:24,409 --> 00:07:27,619
couple technical difficulties and it has
anyone who knows anyone who can help me

133
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:31,219
a it would be it would be really helpful
so first off

134
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:35,089
we figure the if you want to assay way I
think it's me and is anyone is listening

135
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:35,569
to me

136
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,529
time in our house or the pub I'm it
wants to take the presence is someone

137
00:07:39,529 --> 00:07:43,169
can we just use ordinary PR detectors
connected to the pie

138
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:47,688
am so on the left-hand side here after a
picture of these

139
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:50,889
the stand a PR detectors you have as in
burglar alarms

140
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,680
and said your burden on your house is
mine safety in each room

141
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:00,089
now I managed to get hold native these
of a freecycle upside just

142
00:08:00,089 --> 00:08:04,129
doing my usual scare freecycle looking
for stuff to fill my carriage with a

143
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:05,009
notice somebody

144
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:08,069
said they were moving house and they had
a today so I'm

145
00:08:08,069 --> 00:08:11,849
I just grabbed them I R my round pick
them up and I had no idea what I was

146
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:12,919
going to use them for but

147
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:16,308
like many things I just happen to have
it had lying around when it came became

148
00:08:16,309 --> 00:08:16,899
useful

149
00:08:16,899 --> 00:08:20,800
so I had some unease and I thought well
that this is good I'll

150
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,349
I'll see if I can just kinda put this up
to the pie and

151
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:29,159
and detector movements I'm now that they
are the way they actually work is

152
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:33,610
you have to give them a 12 volt power
supply and I seen as his burglar alarm

153
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,550
systems will run up to

154
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:37,750
a 12 volt battery so you have to feed a
total

155
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:42,159
supply and then there's a and open
circuit which you

156
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:45,500
you can just detect the presence also a
closed-circuit

157
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,550
which you can take the present the
opening of on the pie is in the GPIO

158
00:08:49,550 --> 00:08:50,109
port

159
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:55,579
so and I'd I'm and I don't program a lot
size is kinda small little python script

160
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,589
something to test this

161
00:08:56,589 --> 00:09:00,329
I'm so I can have Rick this up on a team
was aiight rip the cupboard of love

162
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:04,160
one in our study covered snow my wife is
very patient with me

163
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,079
I'm but I it gave me a big enough board
to put all the pieces out on so I

164
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:09,810
screwed all the pieces down like this

165
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:12,920
and i connect today's these sensors up
to

166
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,969
am some cat five cable and some Ethernet
ports suck it has put them in a run them

167
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:17,269
out

168
00:09:17,269 --> 00:09:21,009
and that kinda works and so I thought
what I really want to do was tested in a

169
00:09:21,009 --> 00:09:22,110
real situation

170
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:26,339
am and this was about some and I guess
it must have been about

171
00:09:26,339 --> 00:09:31,230
a beginning October a last year so I
thought what i'll do is i'll see if I

172
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:31,919
can

173
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,160
detect the presence of children
Halloween coming round the house cuz

174
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,389
Palin's not like it used to be is it
this there's a lot more activity now

175
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:42,569
so I so will disappear really good
looking to see if I can to take kids and

176
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:44,779
they put it at but a sound out or
something

177
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:48,290
so am so this was destruction number one

178
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,329
to what I should I just describe a good
to see you again

179
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,519
so I I haven't had to stroke the scopes
trial

180
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:58,259
lights which I'd picked up from
somewhere some years ago and I still

181
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:00,970
wouldn't be good if I could have a turn
those on with a bit have

182
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:04,119
Thunder as the kids come down the drive
is a

183
00:10:04,119 --> 00:10:10,439
so I am circles have been switching on
240 volts and again this is I know no

184
00:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,480
electronics I do know you need a kinda

185
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,639
a 240 volt relay so on the bottom left
there had two bills

186
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:20,429
a 240 volt relay which am another via
the wave

187
00:10:20,429 --> 00:10:24,660
these these works which 240 volts is a
coil which have to activate but I

188
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,839
couldn't find one with the low enough
voltage

189
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:31,139
for the pie to work I can only find a
fine vol.1 so I had to

190
00:10:31,139 --> 00:10:34,410
by another expansion board called the
pipe

191
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:39,079
by sup purchase this time a by an
expansion board with a

192
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:42,388
which I could switch five holes ways and
then I could switch

193
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:45,850
am the than a kiss it should 12 volts
that was needed for the

194
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,179
for the base relay for this summer's
switching one relates which in other

195
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:52,789
related to turn on the 240 volts the
stroke so

196
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:57,059
a so that's what you have to do more
than just turn on the strobe would not

197
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:01,019
I happen to have a Papillon much ahead
that my daughter and I made many

198
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,369
many years ago with a nivel hanging out
and

199
00:11:04,369 --> 00:11:08,999
so I and my does it did textiles project
once at school and have on these

200
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:09,769
taylor's

201
00:11:09,769 --> 00:11:13,559
manikins you know Salida you put a dress
on so

202
00:11:13,559 --> 00:11:16,669
I put I thought have that I'll put up at
him as shown on the head

203
00:11:16,669 --> 00:11:21,589
and and then I built this box about this
is kinda small tar the size box here

204
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:26,339
and site a just build a wooden frame and
then I lined it with black cloth and

205
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:27,059
then a putter

206
00:11:27,059 --> 00:11:31,839
a a nylon cords a black non goals on the
front and put the manikin inside

207
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:35,789
strobes inside so its dark when the kids
come along

208
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:38,989
you know they don't seem to think they
finally get to the door

209
00:11:38,989 --> 00:11:43,179
the Lightning comes on and they see this
body inside not so that's the idea

210
00:11:43,179 --> 00:11:44,459
okay

211
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:47,890
so that censored number two in the sense
number one just a texan coming down the

212
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:49,089
driving puts out a scream

213
00:11:49,089 --> 00:11:52,029
so that's actually what I was doing out
on the right hand side here again you

214
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:53,500
can see is very well in this light

215
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:57,170
and you can just see the puppy much
ahead but I have to video here

216
00:11:57,170 --> 00:12:00,699
and which we hope in the sound will work
on a

217
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:04,089
so I'll just say what to look for a with
the light level so

218
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,610
the first thing is that this first PR
sense can you offer should be a cuppa

219
00:12:08,610 --> 00:12:09,540
screams

220
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:13,180
to hopefully scare them and then if they
make it to the door

221
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:20,180
somewhere around about some you should
see the strobes cutting

222
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:23,459
and and the box be eliminated so

223
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:30,459
let's let's see what happens

224
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:42,940
said

225
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:48,269
her

226
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:55,269
her

227
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,170
okay so that were a 10 was really ruling
out that we had two lots that ran back

228
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:01,449
up

229
00:13:01,449 --> 00:13:05,029
the drive as I never your

230
00:13:05,029 --> 00:13:10,389
really upset someone and I in

231
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:16,730
the only have held to ransom by am much
equities right okay so that was number

232
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,309
one thing

233
00:13:17,309 --> 00:13:20,670
so that was so can we detect presence a
network's and

234
00:13:20,670 --> 00:13:23,699
you know was still a long way from
flight it can at this point

235
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:28,389
so the next thing was can we am to see
that's

236
00:13:28,389 --> 00:13:31,509
Camry a

237
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,399
get get an image perhaps and I wanted to
try using the pike am now

238
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,429
when I actually started thinking about
the surrounding the or think that pie

239
00:13:39,429 --> 00:13:42,089
can I just been announced so this is the
5-megapixel

240
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:45,279
camera board for the Raspberry Pi am

241
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:49,459
so when they first came out it was just
a standard camera

242
00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:53,998
and damn the that the thing was that we
figured most

243
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,769
fly tippers will do stuff at night so
what we really need is is infrared

244
00:13:57,769 --> 00:14:01,040
and the the problem with that is a

245
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:05,199
well at that time there was also a big
demand for this for in for a pie cams

246
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:06,439
because I was kinda mean

247
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:10,309
on the internet people who were taking
the filters often turning them into

248
00:14:10,309 --> 00:14:13,790
infrared cameras kazi it just has a blue
filter over the front

249
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:18,920
so them so I sighed looking a bit like
the general success rate moles

250
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:22,559
about 30 percent so mostly they just
naked the cameras so

251
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:26,249
and one out there is a so I was really
up for doing that is only had one

252
00:14:26,249 --> 00:14:29,639
and and again this was another purchase
II

253
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:34,420
eugenia try and get stuff for free but
I'm you know if I'd if I can a a try to

254
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,240
avoid purchasing

255
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,230
set but then it turns out that there's
such demand for this that the infrared

256
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:42,259
pike and came out you can buy the
blackboard which is the

257
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:45,490
the the the one on the bottom left there
I'm to

258
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:49,660
to just put into a strange Iran's reply
so I get quite excited at this point is

259
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,219
we may get visual you know

260
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:55,339
am so connected it all up am now the
software used to this

261
00:14:55,339 --> 00:14:58,809
ago if you've done any am webcam work
with the pie

262
00:14:58,809 --> 00:15:02,399
that the software mostly using his
motion it's it's

263
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:05,519
its open source is a really good one
called zone minder which is

264
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,460
which is a lot heavier duty and you can
now

265
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:12,670
you can come describe parts have your
image in get so minded to just monitor

266
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:15,410
changes in those parts you could do that
to an extent with motion

267
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:19,719
and promotions pretty good at skylight
way in get up running and you can

268
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,840
you know detect various things happening
with it

269
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,890
so a so that now there is a version of
motion has been

270
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,939
that somebody's knocked up for RAM for
the pike am

271
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:32,780
at so I had to download that is a as a
four-car I'm guessing they'll remember

272
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:33,370
july to

273
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:36,740
am but I a damaged that got that going
that looks pretty

274
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,710
that that was working quite well so now
I'm thinking I need something to detect

275
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:46,160
detect motion and that's really where we
get the subject at all and that is

276
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:49,180
am that I thought I would am

277
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,229
on it so it has won a bit before that's
right yeah

278
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:57,020
again robbers are described what's here

279
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,949
so much if I'm gonna put this outside
date to catch light sabers

280
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:06,510
it has to be weatherproof it has to have
night vision on issuing an apt infrared

281
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:07,040
camera

282
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,150
in it had data access and he's be secure
animal people kinda picking up walking

283
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:11,680
off with their

284
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,469
so this is where the welding comes in so
I am

285
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:19,240
I'm I made this so

286
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,320
this this is a.m. so this is a standard

287
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,660
army ammunition box you can get these
mommy surplus stores

288
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:30,890
or and or or on the web about kinda six
to 10 pounds many and what size you get

289
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:34,660
sigh I thought to put the camp the Paul
II in the camera inside is to drill a

290
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:35,540
hole in the front

291
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:38,920
is since mob of actually does am

292
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:42,579
does class stain glass making she's
really good at cutting glass eye goes to

293
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,190
cut this

294
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:46,020
this piece for the front his as she
contributed to the project as well

295
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:48,560
support this matrix this infrared

296
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,969
matrix here to eliminate the area so the
camera comes through that

297
00:16:51,970 --> 00:16:55,200
through the whole here at the front and
you can access it

298
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:59,200
father by the back and

299
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:04,970
they're very secure okay so all the bits
and pieces all sit in the back here

300
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:09,510
the like this now so he's a top tip
other way

301
00:17:09,510 --> 00:17:13,459
these these a really good these boxes
what we use them for geo caching feeding

302
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,290
geo caching a budget catches in them

303
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:19,639
I'm but that they're its heights a.m.
really water-resistant

304
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,420
so if you welding

305
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,090
something onto one of these and you have
it closed what you've got is a very

306
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:27,119
highly contained pieces there

307
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:31,370
which you're then going to heats to 1500
degrees C

308
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:35,669
and am if you haven't got your visor on
what you get is a global

309
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:39,800
loan you can easily get as you get a
global steel that comes firing out at

310
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:40,629
your face

311
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,380
at a very fast rate at Knotts so if you
welding and keep the door open

312
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:49,700
there learned that the hard way and I so
that's a that's pretty

313
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:53,850
you know that's all good chunky staff an
Arbil some brackets to pull onto

314
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:58,320
I'll onto tree I so I figured that now
they've got my balls priced

315
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,530
was proved by someone who just test this
on my best option I talk to testing was

316
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,889
to do it out the test our cap flap

317
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:08,360
so am

318
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,429
bunuel a on the left hand side they're
on that picture there's two solar panels

319
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,270
now buy now

320
00:18:14,270 --> 00:18:17,879
I start buying stuff in this project is
going up in price and I'm really worried

321
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,990
my wife isn't gonna be very happy about
this

322
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,670
but the solar panels is a break to exile
relies on Amazon you can dispel send the

323
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,930
stuff to a different address

324
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:31,020
and pick it up later so she doesn't see
the stuff coming into the house

325
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,450
so that in a is

326
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:38,410
the breakthrough moment that was so we
got this solar powered

327
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:42,350
I'm gonna alarm bash in the bottom of
the in the bottom of the

328
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:46,189
camera there pound of soda powers
especially by the way this is one might

329
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:49,390
the power management is the thing this
morning and I like ap lab tests on the

330
00:18:49,390 --> 00:18:51,380
right hand side exit button while
wheelie bin

331
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,680
and just see the bottom edge of out cat
flap which is where I

332
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,520
place the camera to what and I figured
I'll just see our cats coming in and out

333
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,910
the cap lap these are our cats

334
00:19:00,910 --> 00:19:04,240
there be bottom blues there to Black
Cats

335
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:08,670
am so my am I checked visit be quite
interesting to see what the bottom blues

336
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,070
are doing through the night and

337
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:13,970
see where I'm at. detecting it bebop is
the one on the right with the dodgy I

338
00:19:13,970 --> 00:19:17,500
I'm and he's that he's the boy and

339
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:21,280
one on the left is blues the girl the
brother and sister

340
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:25,510
that's enough about my cats right so I
am

341
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,970
bug or video here missus see my to
squint to look at it

342
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:32,000
am so this was a so I was really
surprised first off i'd I

343
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,520
I ended up with this

344
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,800
am I didn't see any motion from our cats
whatsoever

345
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,669
but this one arrived am we've called
long tail

346
00:19:40,670 --> 00:19:45,250
suspect number one a who arrives at the
step you can see has a sniff around

347
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:48,420
now is interesting because two days
after this

348
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:52,570
I was a past a field

349
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:57,110
those outside in our village and I saw
this cat it Russ Roman of a long way

350
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,500
I'm is a easily up and a half a
kilometer away and this self-same cat

351
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,070
was there

352
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:06,090
but they say he didn't go in he just had
a sniff around as you can see and then

353
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:06,840
he walked away

354
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:10,040
for a bit okay so that's thats

355
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:13,409
long tail number one and let me just

356
00:20:13,410 --> 00:20:16,520
me on to right said the next one

357
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,960
is this one here on the left a.m.

358
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:26,960
going on who steel plant me one that let
me just give you the rundown him

359
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:33,540
rights so this one here

360
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,820
on the left that this is a a separate
different tack

361
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:41,399
a short sale will call him stumpy
codename stumpy

362
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:45,340
and you can see he actually goes up and
into

363
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,990
the capeci entered into the house and

364
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,080
am looking at the time stamp emotion
times them so these images above

365
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,929
the way motion works by the way is it
just it takes a Jay pay and then another

366
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,350
J pagan a competitor in if there's a
difference and it starts laying down Jay

367
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,070
PEQ so all these videos are just

368
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:05,710
is Jay pics have been strung together am

369
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:09,260
but a few seconds later am he

370
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:15,220
am he exits on the right hand side

371
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,840
being followed by beep bop but you can
just see there who comes out say

372
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:22,629
he only stays in for a few seconds in be
bop I think

373
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:27,960
just moves of and season of the premises
completely we always knew he was useful

374
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,000
that cap right so that's

375
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:34,170
so sound now for now I've got two
different cats coming into

376
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:37,600
into the house budget I'm not just can't
believe this analysis

377
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,770
how me these cats in a bit with a
feeding so

378
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:45,700
next day

379
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,430
a we get this one on the left hand side

380
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:52,590
and I'll a Cal describe this to you

381
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:57,520
if any the screens working right that's
on the left hand side

382
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,170
I have another cat as a ginger cat code
name change

383
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:04,310
who actually enters the house and in
that video

384
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:08,350
he has just entered the cat flap but now
what's interesting

385
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,590
is that he he stays in every three
minutes

386
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:17,399
and he exits

387
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,600
three minutes later we don't know why
there's no bebop

388
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:24,050
so on the right hand side he's just
exiting here

389
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:28,169
but three minutes not all possible today
with 3 minutes what he's probably eating

390
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:29,360
the food is me

391
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:33,959
so this this in gave us an idea for
another project

392
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:38,770
which this is a work in progress and let
me just describe this to you

393
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:43,900
and again because I am the screens are
brilliant so top left-hand side I have a

394
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,700
cap flap

395
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:48,380
am thats am has RFID detection if

396
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:55,280
a on it now the those chips the cats
having the next business standards for

397
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,210
that and it's a four centimeter

398
00:22:57,210 --> 00:23:01,080
field feel distance evening and I'm
figuring that we could

399
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,230
have the cap flap able to read that
other I

400
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:07,290
and I don't mind about they can come in
it does matter the cats can come in

401
00:23:07,290 --> 00:23:11,480
I just wanna hear the county's and on
the bottom left there is actually a good

402
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,710
description ever web service you can go
to

403
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,160
send the chip ID and I'll give you the
contact details

404
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:23,610
for Leona okay now some figuring the cat
comes a top left the cat comes in the

405
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,800
cap flat round trip I'd reads it

406
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:29,570
it goes out to the web service it comes
back the contact details

407
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:33,929
then at the middle at the bottom there
you'll see

408
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:38,340
that the year %uh the cat the same to
the house

409
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,970
is then imprisoned

410
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:46,830
okay so we've now got the

411
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:51,020
got the perpetrator in the house we know
who it belongs to

412
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:54,870
I K I'm we've got evidence them into the
house now the

413
00:23:54,870 --> 00:23:58,139
the top right we've got the cat food on
the lab balance

414
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:03,600
interface to the pie so for that period
time we know how much food

415
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:08,939
that kansian and what we then do is we
also generates the invoice

416
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:12,970
the meow Mix

417
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:16,420
which goes straight to the owner and a
course Sims is paid they can have the

418
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,940
cap back

419
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,429
so thats

420
00:24:20,429 --> 00:24:24,960
there thank you so

421
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:28,420
so that that's a work in progress if
anyone wants to help me with that one

422
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:32,410
cutlets this get in contact okay so

423
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:35,490
and right said I've kinda summarize
where I am right

424
00:24:35,490 --> 00:24:38,990
you know I'm able to detect motion I was
set to a neighbor's cats this is where

425
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:40,590
we only flight it cam right now

426
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:44,280
on the left hand side I have the
location where fly-tipping

427
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:47,428
am was supposed to be mounted two weeks
ago um

428
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:50,500
it wasn't mounted because I have a power
management problem

429
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:54,240
I which I will describe gee I don't know
any pictures all but it goes like this:

430
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,130
I'm I had a burglar alarm battery in the
base of the

431
00:24:58,130 --> 00:25:01,510
a the at the module and

432
00:25:01,510 --> 00:25:05,429
I had solar power batteries and I took
out the battery and the solar power

433
00:25:05,429 --> 00:25:08,679
panels solar panels to scout camp so

434
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:12,350
on chairman local Scout Troop I can help
out our scout camp every year

435
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:15,669
we thought it would be really cool to
take the battery

436
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:19,080
and the solar panels to scout camp so
that all the Scout leaders

437
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,169
and maybe some other kids can recharge
their phones and

438
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:26,720
one guy came along as soon as I put a
load on The Bachelor this battery by the

439
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,679
way was inside one of these ammunition
boxes

440
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:32,970
a suitable alone on the battery there
was a lotta kinda flickering in the

441
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:33,720
early days

442
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:37,990
and the battery started expanding like
this now we often have accidents on

443
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:39,860
scout camp we have to put the ball in
there

444
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:43,580
in the first aid book but we've never
had sulfuric acid burns

445
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:48,470
so I'm really just slam close the lid
and a answer like the battery so

446
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:51,780
am thank you and so

447
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,379
firm I have to

448
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,660
I have to do something out power
management basically at this is that the
