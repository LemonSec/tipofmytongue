1
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:15,010
some some space project

2
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,960
goods here it a new here wants to do
some space projects

3
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,820
excellent so for those who have done
some space projects that Miley up for

4
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,800
changing nights

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,580
for those whose put your hands up just
now to say you wanted to do some

6
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,269
hopefully this will give you some point
to

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:36,220
and all we've we can say I don't know if
you can see the space in which to

8
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,199
and a excellent and for those who have
input

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:45,170
your hands up I am I'm imagining that
you can put your hands up because space

10
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,399
is a fuzzy image as fully as this image

11
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,489
that you probably can't even see I'm and
hopefully

12
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:55,899
having this talk I'm gonna be able to
sort of give you some pointers so it's

13
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:56,780
not so fuzzy

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:00,089
and in fact space was

15
00:01:00,089 --> 00:01:03,239
a very fussy topic for me as well a year
ago

16
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,850
a I A but I had enough of the

17
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:10,759
not being able to do anything with space
so last year I

18
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:13,900
decided to stop doing something about it
and

19
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,900
I can start doing something about it so
can you said how decadents light

20
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:29,630
slight deck is not going to do next

21
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,110
up

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:52,390
general

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,210
alright I think f cking abruptly that

24
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,960
it's a fun new that's the last line

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,169
I'm sorry you gonna do it backwards

26
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:09,470
I right again

27
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,130
and so here is the next law it

28
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,500
as you can see so the first project I'm
gonna tell you about A's

29
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,480
kicks at sprites how many people here
have heard of kicks ass

30
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,350
very good and keep SATs

31
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,200
excellent so I don't even need to
explain much about this but I will

32
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,829
I will kind of talk for that that's like
me for those who have been

33
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,269
and no who don't know what it is yet so
keep that

34
00:02:39,269 --> 00:02:43,330
is a project started by Zack Manchester
from Cornell University

35
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,420
and a sign you're basically

36
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,980
is to send is to crowd fund this space

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,190
sport X but also actually to give people
who

38
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:56,519
backed the project chance to actually do
some programming

39
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:00,989
and actually have there aren't sprites
which is a Sat slight so the thing he's

40
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:01,840
holding their

41
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,609
I'm glad you can see the screen now
eighth a satellite so that lead to PCB

42
00:03:06,609 --> 00:03:07,190
board

43
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:10,250
wave I Michael controller which is

44
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:14,530
for similar to date we know one and some
senses on it also has some

45
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:16,040
radio

46
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:19,100
radio chip on it and with that part blue
chip don't have

47
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,609
solar panels but the real thing duce

48
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:26,320
so he's idea basically

49
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,709
ace to send 200 old niece

50
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,840
a sprites which is 8 PCB

51
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,260
pop basically a satellite am up into
space

52
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:39,690
you carried by the kickback mothership

53
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:43,140
so the bigger and suck like their

54
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:46,489
is called tikl at as you can imagine be

55
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,890
chipset is so small the Spy is so small

56
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:53,399
it that's not actually a model that's
actually the the prototype

57
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:58,650
and as the kickback is this fight is so
small that kicks at itself doesn't need

58
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:00,310
to be very big the mother ship itself

59
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:05,290
and so the reason why I was asking if
people have heard of keeps tax before is

60
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,000
because that

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,690
mothership is basically a keeps at it
keeps at is

62
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:13,530
a satellite that has a fixed I mention
one you would be ten by ten by ten

63
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,690
centimetres

64
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,820
and it takes at in particular is

65
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,589
three you so is thirty by 10 by 10 by 10
and

66
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:26,780
it's nothing like hour or still
traditional satellite so nothing like

67
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,950
the double-decker size and the sad or
the football pitch size

68
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:35,110
a International Space Station so it
becomes something that

69
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:38,250
is a lot more tangible fall us

70
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,680
and but the most important thing here

71
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:45,500
is that sprites that sack has produced

72
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:49,390
200 of he had made it available for
backers to program

73
00:04:49,390 --> 00:04:53,520
and and basically a programming
environment

74
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,750
is not dissimilar to your every age out
we know who he has done some modeling

75
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,800
and programming

76
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,350
they are you can all make some
satellites I

77
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:07,770
so and basically be ID's Co and edgier
and it's very similar

78
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,938
to

79
00:05:09,939 --> 00:05:13,029
to out we know I D E now

80
00:05:13,029 --> 00:05:16,419
this project actually was backed packed
E

81
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:20,080
what's kind of like completed of undead
back in 2011

82
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:24,068
and so rewind a bit I was kinda thinking
that

83
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:28,069
I only got to clarify my thoughts about
space last year

84
00:05:28,069 --> 00:05:31,509
and I miss the chance of getting

85
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,599
my RSS like bob was looking enough to
find friendly people

86
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:38,959
like these ones a who would actually

87
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,129
you know welcome me in and let me play
with the kids at that

88
00:05:42,129 --> 00:05:45,580
they fact so they paid for it I get to
pay I get to play with it

89
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:49,649
and so is really really lucky with that
and these guys from British

90
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,129
interplanetary society

91
00:05:51,129 --> 00:05:54,249
was running at project on kicks at so
they bought a

92
00:05:54,249 --> 00:05:57,649
one themselves and they made it
available for people to play with I am

93
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,469
what I managed to join a project kinda

94
00:05:59,469 --> 00:06:02,599
very much towards the end so here is a
photo of

95
00:06:02,599 --> 00:06:07,330
Arsenal listening to learning to listen
to satellite so pointing and tenors and

96
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,188
looking at like in new radio on laptops
and stuff

97
00:06:10,189 --> 00:06:13,789
and I just wanted to show this so that

98
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,349
a you know it's kind of a very

99
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,610
and achievable thing is a very tangible
thing

100
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:23,979
even though if you might not have gone
in the right time if you found

101
00:06:23,979 --> 00:06:27,779
people work who have been doing it am
they will probably in

102
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:31,729
be quite welcoming and welcome you to to
join them and

103
00:06:31,729 --> 00:06:35,450
here is an image all a

104
00:06:35,450 --> 00:06:39,219
actually listening to our very own kicks
that's right I don't think you can see

105
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,570
much

106
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:42,680
on that photo but the idea is I

107
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,420
you know I joined project at the end but
I was too involved in lot of things and

108
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:46,920
people

109
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,090
really welcome about welcoming about it
and

110
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,789
and I help these guys to upload their
code into

111
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,880
get help I looking over their shoulder
for the coding bit

112
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,409
mostly and so but I still help them with
their

113
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:04,930
applauding the code to get help and if
you want to any if you wanted to have a

114
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,070
look at what space

115
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,120
code looks like you can have a look at
their

116
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,980
so now absent of

117
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,430
briefly talked about kicks ass and

118
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:20,910
I kinda wanted to say that

119
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:24,350
for those who feel gotta as I do for
missing out on

120
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:28,230
programming and sprites all you're not
learning it's not like you're right

121
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,800
and the next one coming out is pocket
spacecraft's

122
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,190
so pocket spacecraft's is another

123
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:37,430
assertive a

124
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:39,860
personal space craft and

125
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:43,740
that is of the size of a CD and is a
thin film

126
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:44,410
a

127
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:48,840
satellite so on on their it would have
printed electronics

128
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:52,070
and printed solar panels so these things

129
00:07:52,070 --> 00:07:56,070
are still available for backing although
kinda not on

130
00:07:56,070 --> 00:08:00,560
the Kitsap site but on their own site
you be able to find information about it

131
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,920
and again because the guy Michael
Johnson who is involved in pocket

132
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:06,620
spacecraft is also involved in

133
00:08:06,620 --> 00:08:10,680
kicks at I imagine the programming
wouldn't be very different

134
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:13,710
of her far from reno's so

135
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:17,080
there's your second chance to like get a

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,010
satellites you're right so that's just
to give you the scale

137
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,430
me M I mention we're talking about on
the right

138
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:28,470
is the kicks at on the left is the
pocket

139
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:33,090
spacecraft's so

140
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:38,120
and those all the sort of satellite
tight work if you want to do space

141
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:41,599
project but there are more than just
satellite in the space

142
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,880
of course and that one of its is a

143
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,400
XO skin is project that I've started in
a pro

144
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,459
about open source face it so

145
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:56,720
a.m. a kind of just wanted to kiss those
are kinda a.m.

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
it's actually really interesting to be
able to start an open say

147
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,290
open source pace it projected idea
basically is I don't know if you've seen

148
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,079
them

149
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,190
a astronauts images before where they
walk in this huge

150
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:11,320
pressurized balloon and they cannot
remove

151
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:14,740
very much very easily it's not very
comfortable

152
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:17,830
and thinking about it if we really are
going to travel in space

153
00:09:17,830 --> 00:09:22,020
I don't know if I want to wear those
space it's

154
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:25,710
am so I A had the idea also redesigning
it

155
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:29,580
and and the idea is basically this they
call it the

156
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,350
and by which is the extra have a killer
activity space suits so basically space

157
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:34,900
at that you

158
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,130
where if you go outside and do stuff and

159
00:09:38,130 --> 00:09:43,339
I wanted to make this 8 space it that
it's more natural

160
00:09:43,339 --> 00:09:47,240
in the way a natural by natural means
you are you and your closing it doesn't

161
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,329
get in your way it doesn't mean you know
stop you from doing things

162
00:09:50,329 --> 00:09:53,550
and I wanted that kind of space it

163
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:58,258
and because I have a software
engineering background i wanted to have

164
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:02,009
multiple layers I wanted to have modular
ice component ice

165
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:07,220
status in its so wanted to build many
different layers with each layer

166
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:10,429
and being a separate that too

167
00:10:10,429 --> 00:10:14,769
the previously a bit over decorator
going on a in terms of sup what happens

168
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:17,939
and so the idea basically is

169
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:22,110
a a close at close to skin kinda if

170
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:25,439
a sensor layer which would take your
body

171
00:10:25,439 --> 00:10:30,868
physical inputs and amplify it to you
all too common whichever it is so

172
00:10:30,869 --> 00:10:34,730
if it's the setup pressure rice one you
might help you to the pressure of

173
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:36,990
certain point so you can actually move
easily

174
00:10:36,990 --> 00:10:40,790
and but and aid also takes

175
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:44,759
input from the external world and
passive in so currently you where this

176
00:10:44,759 --> 00:10:47,259
massive balloon and you don't know
what's going on outside

177
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,759
is true that you don't want to feel the
extreme temperatures outdoors

178
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:54,509
I am but you know sometimes it's useful
to have a bit feedback

179
00:10:54,509 --> 00:10:57,620
that doesn't involve you actively
reading screen all

180
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:01,249
looking at some figures and so

181
00:11:01,249 --> 00:11:05,339
it all started it a

182
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,959
at the nasa space at challenge so if you
haven't heard of nasa space at challenge

183
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,679
is an annual event where a where nasa
surfers out all of the challenges to

184
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:18,980
everyone to participate you can
participate as a virtual

185
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,160
participants so you can actually just
say your home and do it

186
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,230
or you can go to a local centre and

187
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,670
and do some coding there you can solo it
you can make a group you can do anything

188
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:30,800
it's very open

189
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,859
the only criteria is the code is open so
XO skin is also

190
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,480
open source and and here's what I've
done

191
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,630
on the need for the first 36 hours on
top of all the thinking up the layers

192
00:11:43,630 --> 00:11:43,990
and

193
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:48,710
everything else and this doesn't look
very wearable but we'll get to it

194
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,230
am so have so this is a spaghetti

195
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:55,240
love cables a spaghetti of cables

196
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,010
which basically does personal things is
a very dark image here not sure if you

197
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,020
can see it probably

198
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:04,470
and basically I've paid

199
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,790
the at flex sensor onto the joint of a
mannequin

200
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,349
and help the rest up to the Arduino and

201
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:17,010
their is a small motive here and so
basically I was prototyping the idea of

202
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,060
taking input

203
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,079
join input and sort of affecting a

204
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:24,440
output correspondingly so that's why did
18 sort of the

205
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,070
first 36 hours a including that website

206
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,130
so if you are more information or like
and

207
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:35,300
said more information all

208
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:39,020
to find what find out where the code is
the code is at WWE

209
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:42,410
W dot XO skin dot com so a EX

210
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,329
0 SKN without the I and and so

211
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:51,350
that was backing a troll then and

212
00:12:51,350 --> 00:12:55,650
so now we have moved it on the team size
has doubled so it was me

213
00:12:55,650 --> 00:13:00,650
ahead in April and now with do and
working on this project

214
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:06,010
a.m. every Wednesday currently and and
so we've we've been trying to make more

215
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,620
wearable stuff so that's our prototype

216
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:13,870
love a finger of at home and so we've
been playing with conductive

217
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,240
a elastic band

218
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,699
conductive a Inc and pressure fabric and
sorta

219
00:13:18,699 --> 00:13:23,109
prototyping different bits and seeing
how it works out I love measuring and

220
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,930
sort of trying to figure out what the
properties of these things all

221
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:28,939
we've been finding conductive Inc fairy

222
00:13:28,939 --> 00:13:32,339
unpredictable I mean if you worked with
it before and

223
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:36,220
you've got some tips for me please a
give me some tips because at the moment

224
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,910
I'm thinking that stuff no matter how I
try to print it

225
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:42,800
I try to screen printed I tried to just
think it up squeeze it out

226
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,899
it to it just doesn't behave as I
expected

227
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:49,259
so last that long and

228
00:13:49,259 --> 00:13:52,620
and I wanted to

229
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,660
so they said they had hereof the space a
project is to turn this kind of space it

230
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,529
experience

231
00:13:58,529 --> 00:14:01,629
into this kind of space its experience

232
00:14:01,629 --> 00:14:06,699
and to do that I N E a lot of different
kinds of people

233
00:14:06,699 --> 00:14:09,959
and different skills I'm checking out
loads of but

234
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,729
serve name all rolls out there but
basically I think there is so much going

235
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:16,279
on

236
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,670
in this space area that if you have you
will have skill

237
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:24,579
okay so bring that skill along and
contribute to one of these projects

238
00:14:24,579 --> 00:14:28,870
so for this one in particular I think it
would be really good to have like

239
00:14:28,870 --> 00:14:30,559
animators modelers

240
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:35,089
or like be our people because the helmet
can obviously do with a bit BR

241
00:14:35,089 --> 00:14:36,690
and

242
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:40,140
BC I so brain-computer interfacing you
know we might be able to

243
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:44,500
bring control something but something to
think about and if you have any ideas

244
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,900
I'd love to hear about it and definitely
want you to do

245
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,689
it's a bit or the whole thing if you
want for

246
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:56,990
and I noticed let's get the number so I
was on three just now and this is

247
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:00,290
a 5 I think the fourth one is

248
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:04,089
a.m. interplanetary internet so

249
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:07,680
earlier this actually at the end of last
year a

250
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,010
respect to nasa about interplanetary
internet they're really really keen to

251
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:12,990
see it being used

252
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:18,290
so again if you want to do anything
about it please come and talk to me and

253
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:19,930
nasa guys are really open

254
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:23,640
we spoke to them they gave us all time
we did a Google hangout

255
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,670
totally over time then and the very cool
about it

256
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,250
so the fifth one space invader

257
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,470
so I've kinda told you about projects
that's going to happen and they

258
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:37,820
that has happened in the past and that
East ongoing currently

259
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:42,190
and Space Invader is a project that is
about to happen

260
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:45,360
is the first time I talk about it
actually outside of

261
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:48,780
outside people that I'm trying to and

262
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:52,530
initiated with and the basically and

263
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:56,100
space invade the Q is and

264
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,930
is what it is is meeting space invader
and chipsets

265
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,189
so like I was telling you before keep
stats a

266
00:16:04,189 --> 00:16:06,368
sort of 10 by 10 by 10 satellites

267
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:10,920
and they are much more tangible but
still we need quite a lot of expertise

268
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,860
to build it

269
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:16,389
luckily their is and open cube I don't
know if you concede a very small text

270
00:16:16,389 --> 00:16:19,299
there but its a project between citizen
inventor and

271
00:16:19,299 --> 00:16:23,399
open cue so open cue is an open-source
keep sets

272
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:29,589
and they've been trying to a sort of
develop an open source format and shed a

273
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:30,639
scheme and everything

274
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,899
they have actually get help repo as well
and

275
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:37,489
but closer to the dates will announce
all these detail as well

276
00:16:37,489 --> 00:16:41,749
on our website but currently and I've
just mopped up

277
00:16:41,749 --> 00:16:45,749
a website and will make it available

278
00:16:45,749 --> 00:16:49,249
probably next month or in October in
fact order in October

279
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:52,759
and and so the idea is we would

280
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,640
a launch some cute sites and the

281
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,760
am should tell you the rest and also
keeps thats

282
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:04,200
and have some space invaders and it
that's how much how much i would tell

283
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:04,490
you

284
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,530
and but we definitely need Adam as

285
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,099
balloon people so if you are from UK
half or have any high-altitude balloon

286
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:16,349
or low altitude balloon in fact
experienced I'd love to hear from you

287
00:17:16,349 --> 00:17:20,260
a that would help out space invader go
places

288
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,599
so definitely needed I

289
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:27,579
and we will in fact announce proper plan
for that

290
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:30,879
in space Town Hall so if hands-on

291
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,750
tinkering in with electronics and
playing with software is not your kind

292
00:17:34,750 --> 00:17:35,300
of thing

293
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,740
there is space Town Hall and space Town
Hall

294
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:42,170
is something that a we want to launch

295
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:46,260
AB q4 this year and that they

296
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:49,810
for the first-ever space town hall what
be sick

297
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:53,230
October which is in line with the whole
space

298
00:17:53,230 --> 00:17:57,400
world world space week thing so if you
haven't heard of world space week is a

299
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:01,390
UN-declared space week where all the
space activities will happen so we

300
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:02,140
having want to

301
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:06,890
and that is on the sick of October the
idea is to provide a place where all

302
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:07,410
things

303
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:11,690
about spacing come together and again
I'm I'm very big on this kind of

304
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:12,910
a

305
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,880
you know I don't really care what
background come from kind thing I really

306
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,120
wanted to see

307
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,439
all sorts of people in the space
community a

308
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,930
greatest long creative technical people
non-technical people there is a place

309
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:24,640
for everyone

310
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,850
and I can tell you for sure that I've
got two filmmakers and

311
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,439
and and the idea of the space Town Hall

312
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,140
is that and people can come together and
talk about

313
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:38,950
space projects now if you have one that
you're doing and I haven't covered

314
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:39,670
already

315
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:43,550
which I'm sure a that will be the case
and then

316
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:46,909
to come to the space town hall and tell
people about it I wanted a place where

317
00:18:46,910 --> 00:18:47,850
everyone can see

318
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:52,600
exchange idea and grow their own
projects in whichever way they prefer

319
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,040
%uh and we will have pizza and be a

320
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:59,870
but if that's not enough to bring your
around

321
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,870
so and here is that the tell for it

322
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:06,989
we are on meet up and it's going to be
in central London

323
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:10,260
at help Westminster so it should be
fairly central

324
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:14,790
and we would have open keep their
talking about being a space

325
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:17,908
invade a queue we would have a

326
00:19:17,909 --> 00:19:22,500
I don't know if you've been to the
rocket and talk earlier on we would have

327
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,460
rockets

328
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:26,669
but not a not the very fiery type

329
00:19:26,669 --> 00:19:31,590
and the we would definitely have
rocketry tight talk and we would have

330
00:19:31,590 --> 00:19:34,750
more than that will have maybe
interplanetary travel

331
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,309
let's see how far that would go and and
so

332
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:41,799
it would be great if I can see if you
want to come along and bring

333
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:45,220
other stuff as well to just make it a
live in a town hall

334
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:49,690
and just in case there's any design
capacity

335
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:53,250
in here and I'm running a competition

336
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:56,630
on designing sort of logo's and badges

337
00:19:56,630 --> 00:20:01,130
and things like that full a space Town
Hall it's the first of all of the space

338
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:03,120
town hall but I do intend to have this

339
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:08,090
running more regularly I and start
making duties for a treat

340
00:20:08,090 --> 00:20:11,720
and but because where voluntary a

341
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,690
we're on by run volunteers I'm afraid
the competition will

342
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:19,289
yield no tangible benefit apart from

343
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:23,370
you name the next logo saying that
somebody has to sign this very cool

344
00:20:23,370 --> 00:20:24,370
thing that you stick

345
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:27,520
on your laptop so if thats all I can
offer

346
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,149
on that and and finally I just wanted to
say

347
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,559
space this fun I

348
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:41,010
add that's a picture up the community
going to European Space Agency

349
00:20:41,010 --> 00:20:46,789
Technology Center her Mulhall Aztec a
net the metal and so we organize a trip

350
00:20:46,789 --> 00:20:50,470
earlier this year to go and visit at
stake we were super cool we managed to

351
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:53,440
get in on the weekend which the nominee
not open for

352
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,680
and we took this picture 80

353
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,740
the Russian module of the ISS

354
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:03,040
a replica of it and obviously there is
actually gravity we're just fooling

355
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:03,659
around

356
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:07,130
you but you do get to like you know

357
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,430
switch buttons and hands into pockets
and things like that

358
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:15,010
in in that the module and I wanted to
say a space

359
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,170
is open I'm wearing a t-shirt space up
UK

360
00:21:18,170 --> 00:21:21,450
and the reason why chosen this

361
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:25,080
image for open this is because this is
an event that we organize

362
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,330
a not only citizen inventor but actually
its let by Kate

363
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,590
and Chris and and we were running this

364
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:36,899
events to Santa bring different people
in is recall because this project we had

365
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:37,400
a

366
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:40,800
in this event people who are interested
in space

367
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,889
could come along and actually go on the
stage and just talk about it

368
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:48,330
there is no a pre organized a

369
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,230
talk so anything everybody's free to
talk

370
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:54,789
everybody's free to book a room
everybody can't talk about any sort of

371
00:21:54,789 --> 00:21:55,408
topic

372
00:21:55,409 --> 00:22:00,390
rock thou's ideas around get discussions
going so it's a really really relaxing

373
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,130
atmosphere and really again really open
we've had people from all over Europe

374
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:10,559
in fact space up you you haven't already
heard space up is an international so

375
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,059
event template so if you want to host
one in your town

376
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:18,460
do it look up space up and you can do it
an

377
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:23,240
and finally I just wanted to say space
is cool

378
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:26,260
I am taking a photo like that it's not
cool

379
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:29,700
but them but only if you could see on
their we

380
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,390
on the space up event we've actually
received greetings from the orbit

381
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:39,669
and from Houston mission control yet so
it's really fun like I mean you

382
00:22:39,669 --> 00:22:43,409
I didn't expect it I didn't expect
astronauts to me so friendly

383
00:22:43,409 --> 00:22:47,309
but it is and in fact is really cool
that they actually the 32 ass

384
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:51,850
did care about all these things so you
know I think space is a friendly bunch

385
00:22:51,850 --> 00:22:56,658
and you can't do it had and so here are

386
00:22:56,659 --> 00:22:59,770
my details again and the website and
hoping that should

387
00:22:59,770 --> 00:23:03,740
have all the point is to all the and
things I've talked about

388
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:08,260
finally I just wanted to say if you run
a space project and you're looking for

389
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,039
resources

390
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,710
or if you're looking for people if
you're looking to spread the word

391
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:16,919
and we have a directory listing fall
space projects

392
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:20,250
so I'd be more than happy to help you to
spread love

393
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:27,250
and make everybody very spacey thank you

394
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,200
questions

395
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:40,200
they have any questions Eric have you
seen any of the pocket keep stuff

396
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:45,800
yes an in fact a.m. I'm leaking

397
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,280
is now know I shouldn't but there will
be some kind of pocket cue

398
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,190
events coming up at some point in the UK

399
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,620
possibly Hall I didn't say that help
sonya

400
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:02,820
yet a higher

401
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,740
so what's the most of the people manage
to get done with these little sprite set

402
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:10,590
and the sprites axis it's a bit of a sad
story actually

403
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,550
so what happened ace and the sprites so
you can actually they have accelerometer

404
00:24:15,550 --> 00:24:18,950
they have gyros on it so you going to do
some reading and it can send you

405
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,410
short message which you can decode and
so that's all very well and contended

406
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:28,110
and the inside story bit is they didn't
get launch

407
00:24:28,110 --> 00:24:33,040
a on the cake sat on the kicks at that
didn't get into the atmosphere and stop

408
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,100
orbiting Earth

409
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,050
and I think back in april may come a
time when they hitchhike

410
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:41,500
with SpaceX launch I'm the only sad
thing

411
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:44,640
is the clock got damaged and

412
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,610
and so the time for releasing the
sprites was all messed up

413
00:24:48,610 --> 00:24:51,780
so by the time it was ready to release
the sprites if

414
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:55,649
reentered so we kinda miss that

415
00:24:55,650 --> 00:25:00,850
but they did say they're gonna do take
to to

416
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,139
things out there these templates
airlines I think it totally depends on

417
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:04,830
the condition

418
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:08,120
and how low how high the orbit is
because and

419
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:11,800
what forgot to mention actually for
kicks at its on low Earth orbit

420
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,830
so it does reenter it fairly quickly I
think

421
00:25:15,830 --> 00:25:19,220
that stayed in orbit for maybe a few
weeks two to three weeks

422
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:23,480
and and people were able to pick up
signals from the kick sent

423
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:26,940
so amateur radio people have been
picking up signals from that

424
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,890
this just a really did manage to release
the sprite so we come pick up signals

425
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:31,720
from the sprite

426
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:35,830
and but I have to I forgot to mention
that pocket spacecraft a slightly

427
00:25:35,830 --> 00:25:36,560
different

428
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:40,740
in that they don't only aim to ruined

429
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:44,490
come back on earth so actually is a
slightly different design the reason why

430
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:44,960
it's

431
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,520
all a so the a disc-shaped on a thin
film this shape

432
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,670
is and the idea is that once they

433
00:25:52,670 --> 00:25:55,750
release these kind of pocket spacecraft
on earth

434
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:59,580
it what kind of leave down as opposed to
burn up

435
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,120
so you will get to kind of it up

436
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,530
and they Chris thing about I think
pocket spacecraft is they don't

437
00:26:07,530 --> 00:26:10,629
aim to stay on our thing to go to the
moon so they

438
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:14,370
came to slam your thin-film a satellite

439
00:26:14,370 --> 00:26:20,729
at the mood any or persons

440
00:26:20,730 --> 00:26:23,880
new

441
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,700
excellent road big red report Stephanie
