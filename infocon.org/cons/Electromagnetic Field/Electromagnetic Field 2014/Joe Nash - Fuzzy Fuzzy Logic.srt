1
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,770
go right this time cause the slightly
odd question blue become very apparent

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:14,389
very quickly why I'm asking this

3
00:00:14,389 --> 00:00:17,640
if there's anyone who's first language
is not English

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,779
use in from riding the bus stop speak at
the speed of light just tackle me loudly

5
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:22,400
please

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:27,979
I've really need this I do talk faulty
fastball too quickly cool

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:34,980
most

8
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,370
I expect that makes no sense to him oh
yes you are still getting victimized

9
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:47,790
under special each hole is well you're
putting it victimizes

10
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:54,790
let me know

11
00:00:55,990 --> 00:01:02,690
have been star cool

12
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:04,489
awesome

13
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,740
and solutions between

14
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,020
awesome who awesome thanks very much

15
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:15,509
I think much coming from I will point
out that

16
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:18,750
up until about two hours ago I wasn't
gonna do this today I'm

17
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,080
so there's anything from this i pod rods
completely I'm so

18
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,340
but younger talk about type-2 fuzzy
logic which is essentially fuzzy fuzzy

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:29,150
logic under than one year who's ever
used fuzzy logic before in developed

20
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:32,190
when its engineering of things like
searching that's ok thanks as great I'm

21
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:32,970
guessing you've used

22
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:37,110
type 1 when it up if you haven't you
talked to Bri don't know it's called

23
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:38,540
talk one sells a stupid question

24
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:41,580
so what you guys used to talk we've got
used for logical

25
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:45,940
outbreak also does come on the made from
a Jesus

26
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,539
a cover but guys this week when just
simply because I'm gonna tell you though

27
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:53,300
you doing is wrong basically I'm cool by
so

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,380
a just a quick note and there will be
ordered to spacious lobby level did

29
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,949
station

30
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,090
I'm other side must not speak too fast
please just as I

31
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:04,110
let's have a simple farm are means I'm
talking too fast

32
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,350
are what point now that you said I'll
just try and slow down I'm

33
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:11,140
if there's any questions any point to
stick your hand on all china's and and I

34
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,899
will be in speed often staged a
counter-demonstration printables another

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,030
loss and deeper questions

36
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:18,299
I'm so hopefully that's a look

37
00:02:18,299 --> 00:02:22,019
I'm the guns of just so why should
listen to me want to talk about the

38
00:02:22,019 --> 00:02:22,440
logic

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,579
because I know this guy I know this guy
but you know this guy

40
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:30,239
on this is Facebook John his car
University not yet he was previously

41
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,640
another university and he's written a
paper for type-2 fuzzy logic made simple

42
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,089
I'm which is arguably a very about I to
preside makes no sense

43
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:42,239
but has over 1000 citations now and
isolates a big deal

44
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:46,060
he's really kind of unified the field
I'm and I

45
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:50,070
just done maybe i'd faces under him all
the same topic with the same vision

46
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,730
sight I hopefully I know someone up

47
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:56,988
I'm also I'm on computer files from Oslo
jet they did this to me

48
00:02:56,989 --> 00:03:00,150
I don't know why observers any questions
many of to I

49
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:04,040
come to target things this video hope
your vision things up I'm

50
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,328
so I'm going troubling too much more fun

51
00:03:07,329 --> 00:03:11,010
and kinda informally our site I G I G

52
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,100
was in contention a much more fun and
informally totally planted so

53
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,160
this is actually a page from talked
about look at my simple

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:22,620
and this white paper does explain a lot
if you understand what this means

55
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm which when I first started fuzzy
logic I didn't understand what that

56
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,450
means

57
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:29,958
and those gonna love very big images on
but as well

58
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:34,310
so took what was logic with but little
but crisp logical booty logic

59
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,870
done so already please note this is this
is true and false as there is a month

60
00:03:37,870 --> 00:03:41,560
so for example other bits in a computer
they can be 10 right

61
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:45,489
and Evan gets this I'm for the something
to work with this

62
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:49,580
and you may not even realize it so is
trying to focus on give me an example of

63
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,760
something which can be cusp of butter
and pulse

64
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,299
and on till which was I'm

65
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:01,599
that align see that's very fuzzy in
itself because you got different

66
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,329
types have to live right you could be
very ill you all to be closer to being

67
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,260
dead than other people

68
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,329
so that's some not very fuzzy so this
like this all things in

69
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:14,849
humanity is inherently uncertain
inherently bake weed out the clue which

70
00:04:14,849 --> 00:04:17,750
will be much of the time haha language
means different things to people

71
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,728
so as a prime example of this ok moms
like hmm this is like later

72
00:04:21,728 --> 00:04:26,370
and so someone lobbies are they gonna
realize it around 1975

73
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:30,560
I'm Wendy to introduce I could fuzzy set
theory

74
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,590
a bicycle fuzzy set theory 6 do is to

75
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:37,640
allow us to classify and talk about the
uncertainties inherent human language

76
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,710
I'm and a vagueness and

77
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:45,349
how to deal with a uncertainties and
days on how to uncertainties know a

78
00:04:45,349 --> 00:04:46,080
model thanks

79
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,300
I'm and the publishers build this myth
you want to see that he's actually sit

80
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:51,570
next to last row T

81
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,599
this is one of many wars economies of
countries work in this field and other

82
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:54,979
things

83
00:04:54,979 --> 00:04:58,640
and take the option to gins am so

84
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:01,810
got to crib sets billion logic

85
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,810
this week maybe you stay so event
diagrams to produce amplicor

86
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:08,169
beset I am be if we're talking with a

87
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:11,690
drive or something may be true is I am a
2002 be

88
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,539
and community sets this could be out
next if you're in my talk when

89
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,500
enough so you might be much ok

90
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:23,940
not make sense because you can be my
talk not muna such a good day to go

91
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,380
no such luck be go sister but the
weather

92
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,779
well as go so leverage really good
example how bad

93
00:05:31,779 --> 00:05:35,810
the human languages and how uncertain
how Vegas sale I would like %uh signs

94
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:37,500
for club right now what party sites

95
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,890
looking pretty nasty in this wind is
really distracting a

96
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:44,440
but pretty nasty or not very nice on
Isola sunny

97
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:48,500
they simply mean a lot not temperature
the knot wind speed and not the

98
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,140
computers contactless information

99
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:54,500
I'm 328 dealing with this is sensual
Fuzzy Sets and possible trust today

100
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:59,539
so when you talk and think that this
they get fuzzy to appoint you can tell

101
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:00,159
what they are

102
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:03,620
I'm futures conyers information I'm as
we have decided mem

103
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:08,479
membership and through membership
increased sets

104
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,370
the such a used two billion sets yezzir
someone's what we do a fuzzy sets his

105
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,240
white in the interval to all the values
between 0&1

106
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:19,159
so for example if you're dealing with a
high

107
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:23,270
you might have someone who's for example
may on about 58 somebody told one

108
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,430
sure somewhat be 0.65 to for example

109
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:30,110
as at this point to make apple to sound
somewhat probability

110
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:33,969
a its creative concept this measures
vagueness was public property measures

111
00:06:33,969 --> 00:06:34,930
likely it

112
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:38,810
I'm so we build sets up this
informations that

113
00:06:38,810 --> 00:06:42,580
the new wave classify many do I sign
that take a value

114
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:45,599
and then give us a membership function
so that thing at the beginning to the

115
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,089
sides

116
00:06:46,089 --> 00:06:49,289
the truth the degree of truth of

117
00:06:49,289 --> 00:06:52,830
indicating the membership with this talk
to awesome is solid one

118
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:56,180
basically meant that there is a fuzzy
set one you to purchase

119
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,320
you give a talk in and it gives how true
the size

120
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,469
to be in one at me in orson much ok
Stephanie an awesome

121
00:07:03,469 --> 00:07:06,820
I'm such a lovely membership functions
so they said to be shaped his ones are

122
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:07,909
trying to the junction

123
00:07:07,909 --> 00:07:11,200
a good this they a trying to them
junction

124
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:15,240
I'm so I see what this does is for takin
a

125
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,779
input value which is access and out
you'd get a value that's on the y-axis

126
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:19,820
and membership

127
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:23,110
so this could be anything this could be
high so I could put in on a comp high

128
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:24,460
because I was we temperature

129
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,649
so I quit attempt this could be the
fuzzy set of comfortable

130
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:30,990
so the site itself is actually
represented by the function and

131
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,060
you don't need anything else trucks and
Sat you don't need the input values just

132
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:36,190
need to know the domain they come from
so

133
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:39,940
if we're dealing with %uh in a Virginia
temperature even sign that this

134
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:41,839
represents how cultural temperatures

135
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,950
I don't need to know all the possible
Bison went I just need to know dealing

136
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:45,969
with temperatures

137
00:07:45,969 --> 00:07:49,270
I'm its like button trim a

138
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,520
find for some without power in maybe

139
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,609
some time trial on this range from about
76

140
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,190
I'm and you can use these two bills
increase the complex system so

141
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,240
everybody most once he got Jeep the
interesting thing about fuzzy sets

142
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,510
posted %uh the inserts is you can have
did

143
00:08:06,510 --> 00:08:09,599
differing membership values different
sets so

144
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,010
this looking at amount graham's in life

145
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:16,130
I'm sorry to have dark bright bright

146
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,909
you can see by clearly that we have
overlapping one sister catch a

147
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:19,930
classifier

148
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:23,599
the amount different substances sets I'm

149
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,669
CMOS wells is useful this is that she

150
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:30,539
being incredibly widely used in
industries is about the eighties I'm

151
00:08:30,539 --> 00:08:34,669
so that might 90w on washing sheets it
uses fuzzy logic and awful lot

152
00:08:34,669 --> 00:08:37,699
aside law fuzziness the wash machine for
example

153
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,979
the Duchess at the waterhole for the
water is it comes for an awesome a House

154
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,500
officials spent it is a No

155
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,540
how hot is used in web ish flashmob
Watford all these things the house cycle

156
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,500
of I'm precise measurements from

157
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:52,850
up how to wash is going to do

158
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,680
so results go fuzzy systems Optoma such
actually

159
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,899
make a fuzzy system a system that and
take some values

160
00:08:59,899 --> 00:09:03,110
use a fungicide use a fuzzy membership
function and did you I'll

161
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:06,060
we have to have rules as a result get
slightly complicated looking things like

162
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,760
this

163
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,920
I'm service I see what this is doing is
a

164
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,520
this is got a collection of fuzzy
membership functions a.m.

165
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,660
arrange number like former so we have if
them rolls

166
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:20,410
on the left the antecedent thats the Bay
of today s that you

167
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:24,360
the billion section a.m. %um measure how

168
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:27,810
much something belongs to memberships so
you can say for example

169
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:30,880
%uh if Haasan

170
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,990
is toll then do an action

171
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,440
but the thing they'll come out doing
nothing they'll come up applying us into

172
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,010
tall

173
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,379
will be a membership values ABC 0.65 for
example am

174
00:09:41,379 --> 00:09:44,540
and then with that use

175
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,699
apply minimum function to the consequent
which is being on the right near the

176
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:52,569
then so if it's in washing you take

177
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:55,750
water temperature say is water warm

178
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:59,410
then action so the action if it's war
maybe not increase temp job holder may

179
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:00,870
be to increase temperature

180
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:05,670
am once you've done that you think a set
out of the rules without rules

181
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,519
you think results at sober to
demonstrate this these ideas and kinda

182
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,029
why this make sense about victimizing my
friends were unfortunate coming on today

183
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:15,040
thanks so much guys

184
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,730
so glad you guys up on stage and another
tall judgment

185
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,980
you drink a beer so into you a and what
is so up

186
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:27,910
sup Dan yeah I'm glad you came thanks
john died in similar

187
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:32,939
school so if you wanna branches of a
high order entry in Ohio Sam what you do

188
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:35,209
n not come on

189
00:10:35,209 --> 00:10:39,388
alright well you're like in but I will
have any free the melodic

190
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:43,220
Kodungallur sent its finds out our

191
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:48,850
go right so hunters recapping sit on the
stuff I classify these people

192
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,009
%uh strictly billion sets so

193
00:10:52,009 --> 00:10:54,629
we're going to have a linguistic
variable by is a word that use in

194
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:56,129
English that may mean something

195
00:10:56,129 --> 00:10:59,430
so it's good lights height is in which
that bad we need to sign some value to

196
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:00,000
this

197
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,089
so we have linguistic values is be tall
shorts

198
00:11:03,089 --> 00:11:06,160
this offense those things that really
mean anything so if you want to do that

199
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,990
now with the logic we have to cite a
criss cut a point

200
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:13,290
where somebody's people watch full show:
as in the same except for example takes

201
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:13,790
its

202
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:17,680
and Sam we may arbitrarily decide da
trying our

203
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,729
someone stole its initial the present
age difference between this is madness

204
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:25,009
there should be such a pay cut off it
what makes so handy find it slightly

205
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:25,889
more sense

206
00:11:25,889 --> 00:11:30,480
between Sam and Simon bar again if
someone is perhaps a centimeter short

207
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,589
and Simon

208
00:11:31,589 --> 00:11:35,579
there because 2010 suck up on shore just
absolute nonsense

209
00:11:35,579 --> 00:11:38,779
site we're going to the membership
functions that

210
00:11:38,779 --> 00:11:44,079
it we just imagine not %uh cities from
the 160 centimetres attention how tall

211
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:45,910
people on centimeters a Cisco the

212
00:11:45,910 --> 00:11:49,279
a 160 and dan is 220

213
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,329
her had

214
00:11:54,329 --> 00:11:57,790
about metric Imperial I'm ENGLISH and

215
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:01,250
this gorilla axo wrapped up its not to
mention function for

216
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,579
and this is where we want of us problem
site

217
00:12:04,579 --> 00:12:09,008
dozen the scary to the songs just after
noon inside

218
00:12:09,009 --> 00:12:12,959
if you were going two sides supply we
had a trap a trapeze in so

219
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,959
you've got a point with a zero an
appointment goes up to one

220
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:19,869
and this stays at one and it comes out
if you decide to the first one would be

221
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:22,089
west on which bus stop becoming

222
00:12:22,089 --> 00:12:25,170
the site total which kinda

223
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:28,170
this going to be on a state web producer
not

224
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,420
where would you decide that for example
in albee's fall where did you decide to

225
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,790
those tools

226
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:37,670
and also my woman she's on the

227
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,519
the temple so web of us point between
some some insect

228
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,540
at this point we've got measure budget
takes in a high and then is setting

229
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,810
a not entry some Simon

230
00:12:48,810 --> 00:12:53,209
it will raise up to $1 so if Sam is 160
in Simon's 190

231
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:56,750
will start to get increasing membership
values so some boobies ever want all

232
00:12:56,750 --> 00:13:00,920
and then 165 lb sore point dunno 207
Weezer

233
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,740
frey et cetera to get some 21

234
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,910
but the problem here is what makes you
an expert in that field why do you not

235
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:09,779
to do that

236
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:13,379
is complete and utter democracy you go
I'm

237
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:16,589
hey you guys is that so I G the visual
example

238
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:20,420
shaky by and this is gonna

239
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,829
going to get one I'm this is kinda the

240
00:13:23,829 --> 00:13:27,819
main thing a lot is already realized
against anti-religious very very quickly

241
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,099
not in 1978

242
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,910
I'm the parliament membership functions
so what we signed with

243
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:36,620
a Takahashi sets Islam you have

244
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,930
uncertainty may have a kiss me to wake
dealing with us to make a membership

245
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:41,399
function as I should values

246
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,980
far the person who constructs and I'm
sure function

247
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,360
what is seen only by the membership
functions to crest wanted to find

248
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,839
it can be redefined you give a value and
Chris membership from across truth

249
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,139
values who comes out

250
00:13:53,139 --> 00:13:57,680
so if not need is fuzzy fuzzy sets when
he says that take about you

251
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:01,060
and then how the truth values each
other's truth values

252
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:05,459
that has a truth value indicating how
true that but bit

253
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,239
this is madness it's really cold is
really helpful as much blacker

254
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:12,850
a bit by hold represent so here's what
my representing its so

255
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:16,220
this Irish aid in green is a purple
uncertainty and which basically means

256
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,639
this is the area

257
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:21,850
are a function where there is now
another man junction coming up it's

258
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:23,819
essential you have is a expel you

259
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:27,209
annex access which is show in but later

260
00:14:27,209 --> 00:14:30,878
I y axis which is your true fans and
then

261
00:14:30,879 --> 00:14:34,610
auerbach comes another access which is
in fact a

262
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:38,110
what one believes that the fuzzy sets
have been talking about between the two

263
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,220
countries values

264
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:43,670
and and this is first looks very nice it
looks like to go to the problem

265
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:47,959
but then I mean struck by this month
issues like how which we actually tore

266
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:48,378
across

267
00:14:48,379 --> 00:14:52,110
getting date from this they're all
unfortunately many ways of representing

268
00:14:52,110 --> 00:14:52,809
them

269
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,079
even to the point now will be decided to
cut these up into layers

270
00:14:56,079 --> 00:14:59,109
and another really solve the problem
because

271
00:14:59,110 --> 00:15:03,930
it's a very complex we gonna do and you
have additional problems in that we stop

272
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:04,559
think then

273
00:15:04,559 --> 00:15:08,930
okay so it was saying that we can trust
people to make the membership functions

274
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:10,420
muslim chick functional made

275
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:13,649
they themselves are certain things I
love the fuzzy

276
00:15:13,649 --> 00:15:16,930
we need to make new membership function
for the membership function but then

277
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,729
the new one is now precisely defined in
Islam fuzzy to reach out to other

278
00:15:20,730 --> 00:15:25,019
you get hot free fuzzy logic atop the
competition Obama to talk to already

279
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:26,180
huge so

280
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:29,689
talk freeze problem feasible and you
think what %uh freezer cheap recruits

281
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:31,170
but the third level so now we need

282
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:34,878
I just goes on and on and the raunchy
people working on tight and fuzzy logic

283
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:37,680
where they do just think was possible to
continue going

284
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,229
and Prejudice fuzzy I'm so as this page
upon shows

285
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:47,129
I'm the only way to really deal with
such as logic is a start despite rising

286
00:15:47,129 --> 00:15:50,790
and because the competition promise to
pay too big when you've got freedom sets

287
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:54,529
80-200mm ship functional Sat there's no
pressure centroid which is how you

288
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,490
actually get

289
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:59,790
the value out this I'm to do this

290
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,870
on a completely continue to stalk
freezer talk to you sir

291
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:07,259
the somewhat what's up a far more time

292
00:16:07,259 --> 00:16:10,259
appropriate go amber just the

293
00:16:10,259 --> 00:16:13,910
the condition common such a huge I'm so
we have to stop coming up

294
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:17,269
which laws accuracy so

295
00:16:17,269 --> 00:16:20,990
really touchable logic is kinda one huge
research question

296
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:24,029
when you ask how to use this today

297
00:16:24,029 --> 00:16:27,629
the answer is as conduct a research
question if you ask

298
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:31,319
why would use it today the answer is
kinda research question

299
00:16:31,319 --> 00:16:34,279
the of how would you can shop for this
size card like a research question but

300
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:36,790
that all people using any of these also
robotics that she

301
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:40,779
one area where is kinda by well-defined
I'm there's a got a Christian Wagner who

302
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:41,529
has

303
00:16:41,529 --> 00:16:44,999
developed a Java library jus E um

304
00:16:44,999 --> 00:16:49,819
which a allows you to make touchy for
large systems and they are bound to be

305
00:16:49,819 --> 00:16:51,040
computationally

306
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,599
signs a he's as I could said slices
which is the

307
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,889
cake so he cuts it and allows you to
specify

308
00:16:57,889 --> 00:17:01,610
how much you want to cut to make it home
safely sensible

309
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,079
am so Khan's summary

310
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:11,680
fuzzy logics made a it doesn't work in
Iraq's it doesn't measure Vegas

311
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,020
we're talking about a legit we can get
that but it's all very

312
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:18,329
fuzzy really learn how to use it but
there is where you can help which is

313
00:17:18,329 --> 00:17:20,230
kinda why want to talk to me

314
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:23,800
we need more people writing real-world
software that uses fuzzy logic

315
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:27,649
and has exams online fuzzy logic is very
much in engineering and research is

316
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,340
planned as lots of the music for years
and years

317
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,889
but none other coaches beyond get how to
open source and no one can get old man

318
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,290
is no light breeze for

319
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,710
that these things could talk it's such a
mostly made for Matlab cost about

320
00:17:38,710 --> 00:17:42,000
four hundred dollars for license is
madness so

321
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,140
their son open source emissions now
trying to get the sub example as a house

322
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,420
full article puzzy

323
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,200
I'm tried developed for my thesis I'm
jump in now

324
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:53,410
contribute jump on just the plan to help
contribute I'm

325
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,550
if you've got any knowledge of set
theory of fuzzy logic at all please come

326
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:58,330
in and try and help us make this sir

327
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:01,730
moving for research and especially by
comparison am

328
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:04,820
how the white sands I'm would love some
questions I'm

329
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,580
CF unconsciousness

330
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:15,020
find the site although many questions

331
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,049
okay guys if you have any questions
which I we're taking them in sets of

332
00:18:18,049 --> 00:18:21,399
three so please don't be shy all your
questions and

333
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:25,750
took it from there okay anyone until to
be shot yes we have no one is in line at

334
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:26,730
a blinding me

335
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:29,799
see to

336
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:34,418
I'm so not talk was kinda I didn't know
how to keep a bit so

337
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,649
don't filled by tossed a key questions I
have kind of gone for a

338
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:40,760
love I let his is there any um

339
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:44,279
limit to the a well if you do fuzzy to
follow then

340
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,799
look fuzzy and then fuzzy squared what
stock but what's stopping you

341
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,059
there in prince will come is just be
extended

342
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:55,860
you know however long yes in Bridgeport
Conn which is why it

343
00:18:55,860 --> 00:19:00,209
%uh some people working on since the
talk and fuzzy logic is mentioned

344
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:04,850
the slight complications with how you
start to represent the celebrations so

345
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:10,070
for example conjunction disjunction
compliment exact role try well defined

346
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:11,090
and

347
00:19:11,090 --> 00:19:14,539
even of discovered these to talk to you
logic as you get to the height of the

348
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:15,870
SATs are some issues

349
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,330
how to actually do these and as a more
sure how do the same the

350
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:22,678
and save you look at Occupy logic now
essentially what you have to do

351
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:26,610
is cut not into an infinite number all
the talk one sets

352
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,039
and then puts a burden disjunction we
take a tight

353
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,330
we take to talk to such cut them into a
different number type 1 set

354
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:37,299
an injunction knows this is a post with
the internet so we have to apply some

355
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:38,929
love disclose Asian site

356
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:42,390
it's just thinking the same way to do
this which is why I

357
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:46,110
some talk to a signed agreement usage
now anything about talk to is a really

358
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:49,490
ish just phiri says nothing stopping you
doing issues

359
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:54,700
mad kate is another question here

360
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:59,490
anyone at all contesto mas chops

361
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:06,490
no Gopalan we don't have anything

362
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,289
have you gone examples of interesting
stuff when I'm season preview

363
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:13,460
physiologic the top on fuzzy logic is
everywhere

364
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,600
I'm and wash machine cover the really
cool want to talk one is actually a

365
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,799
which in itself is hard to explain
because impulse was innis is

366
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,629
lobbyists in camera so far light cameras
being a focus a lot of a

367
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:28,500
autofocus and cameras achieves fuzzy
logic to the time and where for an area

368
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,380
on the images of focus or fuzzy 'em says
brings that this

369
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:36,340
thats Queen application appetite to
there is one really interesting one

370
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,799
which is um

371
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:41,340
allies the spotlight medical research
and so on the cool ones is

372
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:44,590
con detecting whether a elderly persons
fallen over

373
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:49,600
um so obviously that's inherently
already fuzzy problem causing much

374
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,379
bending down to the shoe lace up

375
00:20:51,380 --> 00:20:55,289
'em so but then he was on such measures
you don't know exactly what they're

376
00:20:55,289 --> 00:20:57,080
doing says is uncertainty there

377
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:00,470
and you don't know you don't you have
some to label your day tucks you try to

378
00:21:00,470 --> 00:21:02,029
get real-time accelerometer data

379
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:05,220
answer to that was uncertainty witchhunt
lends itself I want such a fuzzy logic

380
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:06,679
and how much but the system working

381
00:21:06,679 --> 00:21:10,419
it will it can effectively recognize
whether I E person

382
00:21:10,419 --> 00:21:14,399
large the ground is a fall all web
listings and split and has published

383
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:15,789
paper that summers also

384
00:21:15,789 --> 00:21:19,669
and that's quite what the cash in

385
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:23,539
no on 1 to be have the honour the final
question

386
00:21:23,539 --> 00:21:27,570
anatole no there has been no

387
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,830
just wanna yes

388
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:35,049
on does fuzzy logic have a potential to

389
00:21:35,049 --> 00:21:38,340
cause problems if each side useful it
possible to

390
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:41,658
when he should user yes

391
00:21:41,659 --> 00:21:45,110
I'm so

392
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,840
the issued using for a solution is very
much one of

393
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:52,158
whether you're dealing on such a
vagueness is kinda why

394
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,640
type to start being you because a lot
people using

395
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,799
type 1 still uncertainty but because of
the fact that you membership functions

396
00:21:59,799 --> 00:22:04,149
are clearly and Christy to find it's not
on such as it does in its vagueness

397
00:22:04,149 --> 00:22:07,518
say be used hot want to model
uncertainty

398
00:22:07,519 --> 00:22:11,649
%uh its common have any danger action I
G did done such a tease an actor model

399
00:22:11,649 --> 00:22:16,010
which is where units of equation talk to
talk to you can do with uncertainty

400
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:22,379
that made any sense that differs from
Vegas uncertainties Connaught concept

401
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:25,970
okay at 0 just before best finish s just
go to

402
00:22:25,970 --> 00:22:30,220
I believe his name is that

403
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:35,500
so a lot of the stuff you talking about
with fuzzy logic about being a side

404
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,539
safer washing machine what temperatures
that things are

405
00:22:38,539 --> 00:22:42,220
how does that so impact would say for

406
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:45,779
I was trying to build some other I'd
look at like constraint programming

407
00:22:45,779 --> 00:22:49,460
so how does the fuzzy logic stuff

408
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:54,110
okay a so it's essentially is gone by
constructing an expert system

409
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,149
on is ascension nice my packing up see
get a fuzzy logic controller

410
00:22:58,149 --> 00:23:02,049
that basically takes in some input value
that is a crisp value so say temperature

411
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:02,629
all

412
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,750
up wait at the light washing I'm

413
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,110
you have a basic roles so the saw

414
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:12,809
if the rules and foremost like you of
fuzzy set and a possible in the right

415
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:16,860
does the consequent so you jus in places
you want to use expert system so

416
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,049
you've got a knowledge-based blew up am
I see

417
00:23:20,049 --> 00:23:24,389
of like if the rules you take some value
you place these rules and you get an

418
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:26,070
answer out the Costco shout to

419
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,129
them that tells you what the results
from israel's

420
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,590
and buses to strike programming

421
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:37,178
there's a lot to precision same thing so
on YouTube video someone pointed out

422
00:23:37,179 --> 00:23:39,090
that what can you just do this with

423
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,879
loaded conditionals and the answer is
you can

424
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,809
it's just is a nice a model so if you've
got a large database

425
00:23:46,809 --> 00:23:49,840
rolls if you want to change something
you don't have to change within 180 just

426
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,539
update your membership function

427
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:55,149
so it's kind of just good software
programming practice really connecting

428
00:23:55,149 --> 00:23:58,549
compact in different areas you can
change things I'm Nationals the question

429
00:23:58,549 --> 00:23:59,309
at all

430
00:23:59,309 --> 00:24:02,720
faulted in side had who

431
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:08,289
okay amber we just have one more
question allowed to keep coming out now

432
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:11,890
help

433
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,919
tries to sync you when you took part in
the washing machine when he said you

434
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:15,740
might have

435
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:20,360
and kinda membership value point 65
pretty cold

436
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,500
and bent over to your actions heat up
how do you defend decide which action to

437
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,409
take

438
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,610
say you can run point 65 for Haiti
action you got to either run it or not

439
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:33,689
yet so and what you actually have on the

440
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,890
consequence i'd the rules in the action
is another fuzzy set

441
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,080
so we would have a fuzzy set for example
to increase the flow of hot water

442
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:44,120
and what then happens is the as he said

443
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,549
from the consequences 0.65 that is used
to you

444
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:50,629
%uh try some action to be changed to

445
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,000
so that's kinda to actions 0 University
use deceive us scale

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:57,389
all truncate so we might decide to
multiply

447
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:00,789
values on: across 1765 we might just
kinda officer

448
00:25:00,789 --> 00:25:05,450
165 and then you end up the actual
output not rule is itself a fuzzy set

449
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:08,730
and this is why we age apply
diversification am which is usually

450
00:25:08,730 --> 00:25:10,049
cycle the central album

451
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:13,080
which I C takes a college center gravity
Perseus I'm

452
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:16,279
and not with Mb the value the apply to
