00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:55,799
I'm so yeah I'm we're all unpaid
everyone's been working there on time

12
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,570
for really

13
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:59,979
waiting a long time for things outside
don't take it out too much

14
00:00:59,979 --> 00:01:03,519
things going wrong they probably will
I'm we really tried to get it right but

15
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,229
were not being paid

16
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:07,530
I'm got a short-handed people who've
been to

17
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,320
EMF in 2012 and people who came to hear

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,880
like to make the wave last year and
people who came to both

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,530
that's really disappointing yeah it's a

20
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:23,630
I don't know about that anyway undermine
I'm so this year we are

21
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:28,149
over 1000 people and we are almost sold
out so you got no one is coming on site

22
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,230
doesn't have to take a

23
00:01:29,230 --> 00:01:32,120
people you want to call them now and
tell them to buy the ticket I will

24
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,900
probably sold out

25
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,300
on into the day and we will not be
selling any day tickets or laying anyone

26
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,220
else in after that

27
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:42,880
so just a quick heads up I'm and this is
up from the four hundred we had in 2012

28
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:46,500
we have to buy tickets as well you know
bro well over 1000 which is pretty cool

29
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:49,730
I'm Kyle Seager hand up anyone has come

30
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:55,280
from further than america

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:58,920
you do not count Smith so is anyone
cover America

32
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,060
right you will appoint so Heather

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,180
something think whoever comes first gets
a point for me I'm

34
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:08,860
so there the incumbent its desist
American don't go any further I could no

35
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,470
one at all

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:15,370
us maybe it's only really

37
00:02:15,370 --> 00:02:19,780
I'll be nice anyway we're not sure about
that right nearly everything is nice up

38
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,400
on site

39
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,150
nearly everything the land is still
being worked on I'm

40
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:27,590
the workshops and i think is now fine
the status as you can see

41
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:30,900
do not have very good project is I'm

42
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:35,080
this would be a lovely video thought
taken from the air

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,060
I but unfortunately the project is all
are not right and these tents a very

44
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,510
bright

45
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,810
when we tested it with a bit darker and
it's not entirely gone according to plan

46
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,140
we are working on a plan to fix this
hopefully will be enacted by the end of

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:46,790
the day

48
00:02:46,790 --> 00:02:50,109
I can't promise that so the first
because coming out you might have a

49
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,170
little bit trouble

50
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:54,290
there's not much we can do about that
we're very sorry we'll work on it with

51
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,209
quickly as we can

52
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,620
I'm hopefully people for the slide
backwards he couldn't see you up here

53
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,790
I do to stop them I'm or something I'm
not really sure we gonna do interpreted

54
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,670
that to be fine

55
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:06,200

a the projector already mentioned that
way of acting as quickly as possible

71
00:03:53,569 --> 00:03:56,589

CFP at we have one workshop 10 and three
stages that

95
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,409
be fine we really needed more like three
workshops and one stage

96
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:09,260
and that would have been just about
right I'm that's that's not true

97
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:13,820
at but we try to see between the lands

if you have any free time at all which I
know you'll do because you're on here

112
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,660
for a week and it has lost a free talk
please volunteer

113
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,880
we need the entire thing is want a run
many volunteers to run

114
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,200
workshop people it is the paw we really
want is the security which is really

115
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,469
boring but we do have my strings to
watch

116
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:13,100
so you can kinda see that being secure
and watching live stream so you know

117
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,270
that ThoughtWorks I'm

118
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:19,659
that although really boring but I think
and those living outside

119
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,730
a I'm really got everyone's here

120
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,760
I'm really got to be sold out because we
were really notice that we've got so

121
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:26,539
much bigger

122
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,870
in in two years time we thought things
might go horribly wrong

123
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,990
we thought we might sell out with all my
go bankrupt in Russian I'd end up in

124
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,260
jail or something but you know it's

125
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,740
its fine we've with so we've sold more
tickets

126
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,880

incoming

127
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:47,880
side thank you so much to everyone is
here and

128
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:59,049
and thank you for the unexpected ripples
I'm a

129
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,729
yet is a day makes it all worth it we
worked really hard to spin tales as

130
00:07:02,729 --> 00:07:03,300
being blood

131
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,069
pretty small amount to blog about the
I'm and it

132
00:07:07,069 --> 00:07:11,060
will really appreciate it I'm there's
not many the voluntary annual team in

133
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:13,970
the state at the moment there are a few
keeping and the view of the whole team

134
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,949
party organizers

135
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:18,699
it's like 60 them cuz everyone else is
really busy making the event

136
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:23,330
run so his its what point will be in the
van if the involuntary as I said earlier

137
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:26,389
and we have to thank our sponsors now

138
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:29,610
the event will run quite happily without
sponsors nearly

139
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:33,659
nearly I'm but responses come things
like a bad bad doesn't come out your

140
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:35,880
ticket price the back isn't our response
it's either

141
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:39,289
Yukon I'm not get one day we will make
sure we get the same thing

142
00:07:39,289 --> 00:07:42,770
I we have some sponsors covering the
networking at some sponsors you very

143
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:45,280
much very helpfully stepped in to cover
the lower income we didn't have enough

144
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:45,888
money

145
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:49,300
so we really like that sigh I need back
to the pad

146
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:52,940
I need to backtrack were arrive in the
room right

147
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:56,979
the three people back Pat have done
incredible things to make that happen

148
00:07:56,979 --> 00:08:03,979
there's a talk on Sunday the

149
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,919
there was talk on Sunday which I will be
drinking during we will tell you what's
