1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,059
I K kid and slam know any

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,180
individualize anything so I'll just sum
it up never let me be screened by me

3
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:19,250
I'm so i wanna talk about really is

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,430
kinda taking a a hacker race approach to
mathematical discovery while I E

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,890
you should and how you can a

6
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:31,480
with an example from something I did
recently I don't know how long it's

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:34,710
gonna take me i've been prepared based
right Bahraini but something sometime in

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:35,129
the

9
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:39,290
reason kinda five to 10 minutes but
probably I am

10
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,930
so why you should well first we'll

11
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,059
I mean maybe not everyone agrees with a
spot

12
00:00:46,059 --> 00:00:49,780
I think discovering new mathematical
things is one that the mice

13
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,170
radium things that you can do a because

14
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,510
for a brief period you know something
that nobody else know

15
00:00:56,510 --> 00:00:59,879
is and that is a I think

16
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:03,539
a very exciting thing is not as
inaccessible as you might think there

17
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:04,629
are lots of things

18
00:01:04,629 --> 00:01:08,009
that can be discovered that you don't
need to come to spend

19
00:01:08,009 --> 00:01:11,720
years and years studying to get to the
point where you can understand them and

20
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,030
start to think about them

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:17,159
and some of them are are relatively
accessible to being

22
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:21,600
saw the course having discovered
something you can resist the urge to

23
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,880
to tell people about it so that kinda
private knowledge doesn't last very long

24
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,658
and other people aren't nearly as
interested usually as you are because it

25
00:01:29,659 --> 00:01:30,900
causes more fun to have

26
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,439
this goes on yourself in the head by
something that someone else is

27
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,250
discovered

28
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,520
I am butts I'm the other thing is that

29
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,530
in a pure mathematicians as a whole
they're kinda chalking blackboard kinda

30
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,280
people right pencil and paper

31
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,579
I'm it's a pretty old school profession
on the whole I mean

32
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,139
you know they they do use the more
applied mathematicians use software and

33
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,610
it's starting to creep in a little bit
too

34
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:59,180
I'm so the more kinda traditional pure
mathematical well but it's

35
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,259
still really in a pure mathematicians
are mostly

36
00:02:03,259 --> 00:02:07,840
not hackers and Packers amaze the
speaking of you might have my conditions

37
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,769
and my kinda creates opportunities right
there are certain kinds of problems

38
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:18,290
the a much more just a baller a ball to
us or to pack his approach than two

39
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:20,429
into a pencil and paper approach

40
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,950
into nitrates opportunities people like
us to discover things that the feeling

41
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,640
petitions might have missed with their

42
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,070
with their blackboards I so you

43
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:33,079
I mean the particular example I have in
mind is something I did

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,260
kinda recently like in the last couple
weeks it was

45
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,519
them I was a problem that I E I say

46
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:43,340
it's a problem I heard about it already
its and as far as I know

47
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,450
the the best kind of theoretical results
on this problem

48
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,470
prior to this was at the proof was
written by an anonymous user on 4chan

49
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,150
say

50
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:57,010
is very atypical for mathematical proof
that the unique in my not in my

51
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,519
experience for mathematical great

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,700
I'm and the problem is the following one
so

53
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:09,700
I am ambulances lie I'd now like fire
engines they gave me know Nino Nino

54
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:14,900
I'm going me know all around the going
on me I'm

55
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:18,800
was piping and i doing by I

56
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,020
and so what's the shorter sequences
knees in orders that you need in order

57
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,270
to get both possibilities in their

58
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:29,140
ni no ni that you got it got me know the
first day

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,859
knowing the the second that that by the
possibilities are in there

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:37,110
okay but fire engines you know I died
I'm not an expert on sirens maybe

61
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,290
someone here is Lincoln

62
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:42,359
tell me more details about sirens but
them I you know when you hear sirens

63
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,270
going off on the streets in london

64
00:03:44,270 --> 00:03:47,390
is not just needs no was all kinds live
Wiggles into

65
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:52,149
the another signs save I mean suppose
there were three signs up on the can

66
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:54,010
make me know a wearable

67
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:59,899
I am then withdraw more possible
permutations that he got

68
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:03,410
like a bear with me Nino level

69
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,840
as one of them I me we will know law

70
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,500
some but say should be six save his life
nor on the way below

71
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:15,430
Norway will need with only naw

72
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,900
we will know 18 right six possibilities
Sunday

73
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:22,000
I am

74
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,569
so wat is the shortest

75
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,430
kinda sequence any the normal way both
at the firings and complain that will

76
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:28,680
get

77
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,949
all those possibilities in there
somewhere I am

78
00:04:31,949 --> 00:04:35,250
so I know the answer to this I'll see if
I can do it

79
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:40,310
I am and I think about this for a second

80
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,610
Nino away baloney

81
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:51,639
nor need we were able nor on me rice I
i'm

82
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:55,300
safety think about thank you I

83
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,889
say I mean if you if you if you think
about that you'll you'll see that all

84
00:04:58,889 --> 00:04:59,250
that

85
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,509
every see all 6 possibilities have been
included in there somewhere

86
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:06,409
but there are any nine sounds in that
sequence I'm so

87
00:05:06,409 --> 00:05:09,680
it's more efficient than just doing all
that 6 possibilities

88
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,020
one by one I'm you see you've saved some
effort

89
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:17,299
and that there's a there's a cleanup
algorithm that you can use to construct

90
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:17,969
this

91
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:22,300
kinda sequence a different number thus
and so simple permutations with my

92
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,810
ill-considered title I'm because someone

93
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:30,240
in about nineteen ninety-three decided
that see permutations what they want to

94
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,639
the call the sequences

95
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:34,870
because may contain all the possible
permutations

96
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,919
so they're like super because they
contain the mall I guess is the idea

97
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
like a superset

98
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,680
I am side anyway so

99
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,520
that you can concise implementations and
it turns out bats

100
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:50,500
but or symbols I'm not gonna attempt
today that s

101
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,159
I'm sorry I didn't think about it but I

102
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:57,250
need to practice law small I have today
before symbols

103
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:01,759
I am it is this was 24 plus

104
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:06,520
9 it must be 3333 sounds long is the

105
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,469
shorter sequencer find signs that
contains all the possibilities

106
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,990
and in general the construction guys it
goes

107
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:18,229
delayed by what factorial is I K

108
00:06:18,229 --> 00:06:21,529
I'm so it's it's a summer factorial safe
but

109
00:06:21,529 --> 00:06:26,919
save us for five signs it will be one
factorial plus two factorial plus three

110
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:28,659
factorial pass for factorial

111
00:06:28,659 --> 00:06:31,030
plus five fights Oreo

112
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:33,940
and until about the spring of this year

113
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,190
it was all know whether this

114
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,780
kinda but say point if you do one point
to a possible do with me

115
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:45,080
but up to five factorial the answer is
153

116
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:49,258
I'm and so you can construct a sequence
of 153

117
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:54,020
II with the five signs be it would be
like Kat de Remy

118
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,599
last side is that right if they were it
was maybe more a musical

119
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:02,550
kinda fire engine than the traditional
ones I am

120
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:06,380
so that they will be at the second 253
dire a mother

121
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:09,380
Bob the I'm the the

122
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,930
there's a probe as I say that the only
written version is proven I'm aware of

123
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,960
was written by anonymous 4chan user

124
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:20,669
I which proves that's the shortest
possible sequence

125
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:25,490
I'm would be 152 sounds long say there
was this kinda unknown question

126
00:07:25,490 --> 00:07:29,830
was the 152 or 253 the sources 1-for-5
signs

127
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:35,590
and a bloke who whose day job is
designing processes but

128
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:38,590
in celeb who obviously is a mathematical
hobbyist

129
00:07:38,590 --> 00:07:42,650
write a C++ program that user relatively
clever

130
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,469
kinda technique T will find out all the
possible

131
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:52,210
and shorter firsts five simple things
and anyway but the answer is

132
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:56,520
153 is the shortest but the eight
different ways of doing it and not just

133
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,549
the obvious way

134
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,270
I am Sunday

135
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:07,340
then I have time ne three-minute pop 80
K

136
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:10,619
said the fungal the traveling salesman
problem I

137
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:14,539
serve as a salesman who has to travel
and to laws in different cities to sell

138
00:08:14,539 --> 00:08:15,090
his

139
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,810
on underwear to all the people have
these different cities

140
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:22,849
and he was do this in the most efficient
way possible so he wants the route that

141
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:25,560
has take the shortest distance the
visits all the cities

142
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:28,940
and then returns to where he started and

143
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:33,279
a.m. so although maybe it's no obvious
this particular problem is kinda the

144
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,650
same problem really

145
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:38,309
because your cities although different
permutations

146
00:08:38,309 --> 00:08:41,010
I'm going to the rate is the number of
difference and

147
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:44,590
that you had to do to make the next one
I

148
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,810
say you want to make all the difference
all the different permutations

149
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:51,290
by the shortest possible route so
basically it this

150
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:55,949
is an instance of the Traveling Salesman
Problem and it also turns I'm that very

151
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:57,270
very smart people

152
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,590
have been working out will have ways to
solve the traveling salesman from

153
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:05,550
ever since some guys a rand corporation
in the nineteen fifties first kinda

154
00:09:05,550 --> 00:09:06,540
started typing this

155
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:09,550
and it's really really well study in
there are really really fucking good

156
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,969
algorithms for doing it with you can
download for free

157
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,010
and they have a competition every year
to see which ones the best

158
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,420
I and so so the quest for proper sex
symbols was totally unknown

159
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:26,260
bike I kind of noticed thats it was the
same as the traveling salesman problem

160
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,020
so I downloaded up right ankle LKH

161
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:32,130
which mine solutions the traveling
salesman problem I am

162
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:36,870
and on a in a way to it input syntax and

163
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:40,590
at this thing into and I left it running
overnight and then

164
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:43,760
when I wake up the next morning it had
disprove this

165
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,280
hit disprove this 20-year-old conjecture
that

166
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:52,640
the sort of thing for sex symbols would
be 673 symbols long

167
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,000
was the conjecture I think if you if you
add it up I

168
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,770
but is not rape is not true at all is
well that 672 symbols long

169
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:05,130
I had gone undiscovered for twenty years
but I see you can discover in one night

170
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,450
just by kinda but reading the manual for
a

171
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:12,670
c:\program and leaving it running home
health aides I am

172
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,420
so that's really the end to the story
thanks

173
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:20,219
the

174
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:25,370
anyone every question who will be cool

175
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,720
uploaded a

176
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,000
cut three page paper to the archive yet
not technically published but get enough

177
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,329
money

178
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:39,410
I

179
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,740
up Obama to back

180
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,850
to like who stop by the fullest up a
little

181
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:51,620
you

182
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:57,370
sorry

183
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,180
I D died it's amazing edits to the

184
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:04,069
online encyclopedia means two sequences
yes can say that there is a sequence

185
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:05,540
related to this problem

186
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,660
which said that it was connected to be
equal to these other sequence which is

187
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:09,219
the sum

188
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,160
all but factorial zone I submitted my
edits a

189
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,719
saying it was connected to be good that
sequence but actually isn't

190
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,800
and included a reference to that to my
thing at who and Bama question at the

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,170
back

192
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:28,170
I'm I can say that yeah I left it
running for a few days but it didn't

193
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,660
really seem to be any

194
00:11:32,660 --> 00:11:36,269
anywhere even close to the conjectured
band so I think some

195
00:11:36,269 --> 00:11:39,350
more intelligent approach is likely to
be needed disperse have been

196
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,079
as far as I can sale but the other thing
that's unknown is what the actual

197
00:11:43,079 --> 00:11:44,760
minimum is for six

198
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,470
so I'm the program the uses a heuristics
already searches for solutions but it

199
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:51,040
doesn't prove that their minimal

200
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:56,000
I I tried an exact solver that proves
that the solutions manual it ran for a

201
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,470
week and then crashed

202
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:01,459
a so I we I so don't know the answer to
that

203
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:04,529
go thank you program run out time

204
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:04,930
so cold
