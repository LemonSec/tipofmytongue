1
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,060
okay we do not have so weak or near

2
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,040
with

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,879
on sex drugs and rock and roll

4
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:18,330
0 hard

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:21,598
the can you hear me

6
00:00:21,599 --> 00:00:24,869
for the coming here check i think is
switched the

7
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,550
p and I can you hear me great thank you
so much so

8
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,670
as he said my name is Ellie and I'm
talking about sex drugs and rock n roll

9
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:38,309
I've just written a book what we've got
here for failing to shop at peace

10
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:42,269
3 a favorite activities a private guy

11
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:46,330
I anyone with you have children in the
audience

12
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,410
I will be using graphic language I will
be talking about

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,129
our hearts I will be talking about
addiction and drug so

14
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:56,729
just full disclosure I don't like it
I'll hearing anything dirty

15
00:00:56,729 --> 00:01:00,030
letting you know now so I

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,650
either but my book is about 5 hedonism
and

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,689
activities that we tend to think as
simple

18
00:01:06,689 --> 00:01:10,000
what size is the hottest these things
%uh

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,330
an awfully just my butt it contains

20
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:16,939
a lot I really really amazing stories in
the history of science and I just to

21
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,119
give you a snapshot

22
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,510
the few things that are in there a but
the ohio is home to

23
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:26,660
homes made a story it's really to get it
the public can see the screen

24
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:30,220
but its a bigger I'll Rodin's the
thinker

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:34,670
and no question that I think the answer
is what does it mean to be human

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:38,240
what defect drugs and rock and roll
teach us about

27
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,830
what it means to be human because this
is a question that has occupied the

28
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:42,890
lines outside

29
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,980
philosophers is the lone became
self-aware

30
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:49,590
what is it that specializes the human
species

31
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,590
away from the animal kingdom what is it
that makes sense to me

32
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:55,230
is that the capacity Matt Matt

33
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,800
is it the ability to write things down
it

34
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:02,479
fact that I can think about the past
present and future itself haha what is

35
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,580
it that makes us fat

36
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,880
and traditionally scientists have
focused on are higher cognitive

37
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,250
capacities are so

38
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:13,340
our point but frontal cortex activity
think that are thought to be

39
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:16,530
elevated him in terms of higher thinking

40
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:20,560
meanwhile other activities getting high

41
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,370
getting laid and rocking out have been
denigrated as permitted

42
00:02:24,370 --> 00:02:27,380
they've been denigrated animalistic they
document thought

43
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,880
anymore basil parts are species what are
these but these three things

44
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:35,970
are just as important defining
characteristic up the human species they

45
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:36,870
can't see it

46
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:40,970
but photographically hendrix at
woodstock and this photograph

47
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:45,190
says it all got Jerry fact our lives
you've got

48
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,410
400,000 people in front of him and most
people you might not know this but she

49
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,250
used to wear

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,600
have acid underneath his friend that I
think it's a high the whole time

51
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:58,030
and display good audience up 400,000
people

52
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,239
and today we think that we're hardcore
with glass cover you know

53
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:04,680
75,000 people now that has

54
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,900
nothing on this festival 400013 kids
field

55
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:13,390
in upstate New York without fairly
evidence toilets restaurants coffee

56
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,839
Rs all for the power of music and then
one

57
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,060
stage one state and well didn't have to
this third a lot about how much we value

58
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,940
sex drugs and rock and roll if you
haven't been paying attention you might

59
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,970
not think that these are important
qualities of our species but clearly

60
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:30,690
they are

61
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,770
so what scientists discovered

62
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:39,020
about supposedly based pursues what have
modern empirical investigations

63
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:44,220
hot but moreover I view the content of
this lecture I like to think about what

64
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,090
do you think

65
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,090
teacher scientific method it's a two-way
street

66
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:53,630
so let's get to everyone's favorite
subject sec

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:58,250
how the people here know that every sale
yes okay this area has a doctor not

68
00:03:58,250 --> 00:03:59,380
addressed in the Renaissance

69
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,900
era and he's known as the father of
anatomy he basically invented

70
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,010
are draw human for in a scientific
manner

71
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:09,429
and he with surely a genius and he was
capable

72
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:13,610
level is stated about the heart I her I
dot

73
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:16,730
tough but a very dirty content that you
might not want her to live

74
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:19,959
a near 50 are you sure

75
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:23,050
icon vector for like 15 that

76
00:04:23,050 --> 00:04:26,669
okay sir

77
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,969
okay your time okay so that their

78
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,660
capable hallucinating about the heart
and he was capable tracing the two

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,730
leaving ovaries to the uterus looking
into and he did not believe in the

80
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:40,880
existence of the clitoris

81
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,690
he believes that it didn't think this
where a colleague ahead

82
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:48,980
30 Colombo and Italian claimed to have
discovered

83
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:54,300
real failed to discover the clitoris and
he was not the only enough to the time

84
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,940
painting the very first person to ever
fight this thing and we all have a right

85
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,860
to the family at

86
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,790
and he described it as well so pretty
and useful thing

87
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:07,320
and a failure shot back you can hardly
be described as

88
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,540
you and you part as if it were an organ

89
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:13,919
to healthy women keyword near

90
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:19,200
and useless however modern studies have
found that the cleaners contain

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,630
8 thousand nerve endings a higher
density it out

92
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:26,310
a world of a human body outside the
brain it is the

93
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:29,320
all heart-to-heart that appears to be
designed for pleasure

94
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,659
and only pleasure it if they did

95
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:35,860
a prickly and useful thing well for you
can't quite

96
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:40,330
I see that actually so a in five years
ago you're all just an Australia

97
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:43,490
map the shape it and they found that
it's not just a little nub

98
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,890
on the air her body expand inside the
body into western structure that goes

99
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,229
all the way around I'll

100
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,590
and it grows inside as we get older now
the family is

101
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:57,200
was not capable of causing death either
through dissection

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,860
or recreational activities well and have
to call me a lot more about him than it

103
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,850
does about their

104
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:07,170
now through the clutter since I declare
sir its colorful

105
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:10,920
at quirky let's get to your credit and
my

106
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:15,190
Sigmund Freud sigmund freud did not
think the criticism at Andheri

107
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:18,670
knew it existed however he said it was
childless he said

108
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:23,390
only women who masturbated climax for
manual stimulation

109
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,469
butter acquired it to achieve orgasm and
we believe that

110
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:31,140
marriage and facts and maturation and
meeting with a man

111
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:34,200
a woman would develop into immature form

112
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:37,990
climax only penetration not requiring a
man

113
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:41,730
ugly man when I add to use its fingers
are a stud now

114
00:06:41,730 --> 00:06:44,990
more holistic Toro battle

115
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,970
transfer and he said that this is a key
cornerstone in a woman's life

116
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:52,970
now denigration football simulation

117
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:57,380
was not restricted to the mail our
species this is my favorite stories in

118
00:06:57,380 --> 00:06:58,430
scientific history

119
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:02,160
and the seismic studies fact this is
princess Marie bonaparte

120
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:06,070
precisely how to part with the great
grandniece a pollyanna

121
00:07:06,070 --> 00:07:09,140
you can see in the photograph is where I
basically a crown and

122
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:13,409
a lot of pride in here she clung to her
legal heritage with every

123
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:16,970
inch her BA and there was another into
her BA that

124
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,330
scrutinized great interest and that was
depths between her curves in her vaginal

125
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:21,859
opening

126
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,600
she did not climax from penetration
alone and this caused a great fair

127
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,670
but I think 2020 out like a lot of the
day

128
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:33,560
feel that she was that good that she was
improperly filled because her clitoris

129
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:37,000
was required for orgasm so what did she
hear

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,580
she concocted a scientific study
gathering data

131
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,719
like and intrepid scientist would she
measured the distance between the first

132
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,980
and the bad opening

133
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:50,230
Inc you 143 when it and just let them
into three categories:

134
00:07:50,230 --> 00:07:54,420
d capital at the end the methodology and
the to let people could be a

135
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:59,050
and she said that women who had thicker
further than an inch and a half other

136
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,120
gotcha opening

137
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:05,170
would not come from penetration lol she
made herself so she decided that she was

138
00:08:05,170 --> 00:08:08,940
but the unfortunate collected over the
end up her ass was chief are

139
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,680
her vagina so what did she do she hired

140
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:16,750
Thurston and the third Smith the
ligament

141
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,890
connecting workers to her body and
repositioned a closer

142
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:25,390
to her about putting and then know that
if I like to trace a lot

143
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,409
said she had him do it again

144
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:32,229
it was in the 1920 like I had saved her

145
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:35,940
stranger infection well it's great
credit had a third and

146
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:40,020
reposition her clitoris twice through
the clutter

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:43,520
doesn't end there let's get to you I
love the charmers

148
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:48,160
masters and johnson these were two most
famous excited to ever let

149
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,850
william masters but a study people
having sex in the lab and

150
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:56,100
new with this would look suspect he
thought it was a little weird if there

151
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,050
was to think if I just watching people
have sex in the lab moreover

152
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:03,209
modern scientific studies look at
couples who volunteer

153
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,580
he put red strangers together

154
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,860
have sex in front of them and he knew
that this would look of especially

155
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,940
because he's using prosecutes mostly

156
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,940
and grad students now

157
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:17,890
but what can you do to make the would
love to back he decided to have a female

158
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,810
caller on his papers so you're fired
secretary

159
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,199
virginia hotel sorry the Masters and she

160
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:29,680
eventually he left his wife for her
these were rock star signs that they

161
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,260
were on the cover of Time magazine they
were very famous

162
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,930
through their study if they decide that
led do not fine actor

163
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,969
penetration alone suffered from both
sexual dysfunction and the even with the

164
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:41,740
party

165
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:44,970
the word did the describe but

166
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,150
now the great game changer in the
history of the chorus is this woman

167
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:52,220
shari hi sherry hi what

168
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:57,370
than it is now okay she still obey and
she was a student at Columbia University

169
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:58,520
in the nineteen seventies

170
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:03,640
and she couldn't bear to it like a lot
of America you want to be a psychologist

171
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,100
to us decide that and it was just you so
what did she do

172
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:10,100
to pose for Playboy take it I

173
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:15,010
frankly if I could do that so she took
her to her car

174
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:18,420
as you didn't know it was gonna look
like when it's printed when the

175
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,189
photograph is printed it was heard from
a typewriter and the struggle I read

176
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:27,600
the typewriter smart she doesn't have to
be

177
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,540
so what did she do she staged a protest
in front of

178
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:33,900
labor headquarters against the very I
she had appeared a

179
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,600
how cool K get but you dont

180
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,810
incredibly groundbreaking research she
interviewed 800

181
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:44,189
thousand women aged 14 to 17

182
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,500
8 this is a lot outside a lot of people
think about eureka moment they think

183
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,870
about running naked through the streets

184
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,100
at yet holiday other

185
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:57,589
I would never I think a it so few
hundred thousand women and

186
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:01,329
a you know a lot of people think about
eureka moments people think about you

187
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,880
know that big lamp and

188
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,649
you know but I realized a shipwreck a
lot size just involving incredibly

189
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:08,459
patient and gathering lots of data

190
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,010
and that's the way it tells so she had
the she found but

191
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:16,209
seventy percent of women require direct
control stimulation in order to orgasm

192
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,459
seventy percent okay

193
00:11:18,459 --> 00:11:22,310
and that figure has however ever sent
past three years every other study has

194
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:22,589
found

195
00:11:22,589 --> 00:11:26,000
pretty much the same thing when she
published her finding

196
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,170
like what I think hold it the hate for
parts

197
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:33,240
I hate report however research reveals
that is indeed

198
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:36,500
as well the colors that a pretty and
useful thank

199
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,170
now got to the lab that he is your
favorite body part and I'm

200
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:45,579
now the pier also has an anatomical
parts separately

201
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:49,149
mo mammals have bones and their penises

202
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:52,199
and both reviews for quickie thorson

203
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:56,459
for quickie meeting and allows avail to
simply a insert himself into a female

204
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:57,989
very easily at any moment

205
00:11:57,990 --> 00:12:01,899
Inc and for the second start cat Wales

206
00:12:01,899 --> 00:12:05,110
about to get to the photograph but this
is a penis found %uh

207
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:09,350
a walrus and there's a pencil underneath
it was for size comparison it but

208
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:13,699
Bay it's called Lucic and anyway it use
it as a weapon to workfare

209
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,430
be used as a club the fact that

210
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:20,620
human don't have a ton in their penis
and

211
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,500
by the way chimpanzee do for the fact
that our cousins relatives do it without

212
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:29,079
further indicate how special this is for
Spc the fact that we don't have a penis

213
00:12:29,079 --> 00:12:29,709
pony

214
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,969
that other factors are required to get
up and keep it up in the in other words

215
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:36,250
behavior

216
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:39,480
and psychology in the mines rights have
/url for things like

217
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,350
arousal and sexuality which means that
what goes on

218
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:47,029
when we have sacked is unique in the
animal kingdom so

219
00:12:47,029 --> 00:12:49,870
appearances other tricks up its sleeve
if you look

220
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:53,020
at the brain fairness through inside
everyone

221
00:12:53,020 --> 00:12:56,910
break although some backhoe sensory
cortex that basically a map it feeling

222
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:02,939
and it basically WinSite opener side to
slap where body parts are positioned

223
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,020
in this region they basically 0 straight
for 5 with your brain

224
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:11,720
that is devoted to sensation in that
region so for example the lips are huge

225
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,330
the Isaac use I the torso is very very
small

226
00:13:15,330 --> 00:13:19,710
actually a very sensory nerve endings in
your back so you can turn this into a 3d

227
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,690
model and this is what scientists
produced in the nineteen fifties

228
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:26,110
it's a spectacularly I think feature
called about the left side of the

229
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:27,540
computer has a massive

230
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,790
the eyes a massive when this was
published by Walter penfield

231
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:35,779
colleagues in the nineteen fifties they
live lie

232
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:38,839
they made a very very significant a
mission but that they are met

233
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:44,250
the actual blood to the penis an updated
version published five years ago

234
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:48,810
looks like this I'm not quite sure who
can fear but remember is an enormous

235
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,650
we can any now no discussion

236
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:57,029
aside as tax would be complete without a
discussion of homosexuality

237
00:13:57,029 --> 00:14:00,439
clearly this is a very very critical
because we are in but

238
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,440
heart you know as you I'm sure all very
well aware

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,680
we fact this country's greatest
scientist ever the chemical castration

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,390
you know wild on science well to us this
is the mainstream view

241
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:14,780
for a very long time ensure loading
we're very familiar

242
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:18,260
history how homosexuals have been
treated not just by religious

243
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:22,140
pontificators and politicians but by
scientists they have been denigrated as

244
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:22,730
disease

245
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:26,670
apologize subject to mental institution

246
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,110
I for therapy these charming people back
to Johnson

247
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:33,250
compared people to have random sex in
the lot in front of them

248
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,790
they made a fortune think of conversion
carry

249
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:40,500
subject game and psychological fair for
them

250
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,610
but this is the worst thing that was
that homosexuals I think this is the

251
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:45,070
worst

252
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:49,700
icepick lobotomy you know lapekin quite
me that there is

253
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:53,060
a medical doctor front there I Walter
Freeman

254
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:56,260
and you've got I pick a hammer and
sliding the ice pick

255
00:14:56,260 --> 00:14:59,569
underneath the eyelid into the Frontalot
and

256
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:02,710
swirling around just %uh for connections
between the frontal

257
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:06,150
and other structures in the back to the
brain and it was proper to the treatment

258
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:07,240
for homosexuality

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:11,850
in america and thousands of gay men have
that stands well the reason for this is

260
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,460
that mainstream science accepted the
idea

261
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:18,670
that being gay was appalling there were
lots a scientist who thought it was

262
00:15:18,670 --> 00:15:20,689
ridiculous and try to overturn

263
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:23,790
mainstream thinking the most important
part of this guy

264
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,620
if there's any way the audience
homosexual you should know his name

265
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,870
effect everyone yeah

266
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,270
name has a list of Courtney prior doctor
who prior

267
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:34,850
was a psychiatrist in likely sixties and
seventies

268
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,460
and he was gay and he couldn't come out
of the closet because mainstream

269
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:39,490
scientific thinking

270
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,900
had put homosexuality into the
diagnostic and statistical manual

271
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,250
this is basically the 50 psychiatry that
decrease what healthy and what is not

272
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:51,600
and declare their homosexuality with be
so he could

273
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,750
about father because entire life his
career through it

274
00:15:54,750 --> 00:15:59,120
he gave a presentation that the American
Psychiatric Association

275
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:02,900
a GM in a rubber mat away

276
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,530
ataxia and he gave an impassioned speech
under the name

277
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,939
doctor 8 anonymous now I'm they

278
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:14,010
wearing a rubber mat at a tuxedo and a
fucking quake would make you look saying

279
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:17,430
but it worked and homosexuality was
removed from the DSM

280
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:22,089
just one year later I think about how
much courage it took to do that the

281
00:16:22,090 --> 00:16:22,760
third stage

282
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,000
knowing that at any moment somebody
could run up and take off the mask and

283
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,200
reveal who you really were

284
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,410
your life would be good so what what i
can. for the study of sex and studies

285
00:16:32,410 --> 00:16:32,890
I'll

286
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,620
side people people are flawed and
sometimes

287
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:40,970
smart people still think stupid thing
specially when it comes to something

288
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,240
offensive at Saks

289
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,650
which in a deeply personal subject get
very sorry about

290
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:49,069
over it K bravery and rebellion

291
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:54,420
over to her and tried cited stupidity
sometimes being rebellious is important

292
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:57,640
to really progress towards the truth
moreover

293
00:16:57,640 --> 00:17:01,680
site has revealed that at home victory
behaviorally and psychologically

294
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,179
we are on arrival in the animal kingdom
with respect to our sexuality

295
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:10,370
it is a very special thing where the
defining characteristics our species

296
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:14,050
other animals might grow and reproduce
but we take it to the next level

297
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:19,030
rights next up I'm not quite sure how
much you guys are into the subject this

298
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:19,869
is Dhruv

299
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:23,229
I normally talk about this at music
festivals where most of the audience is

300
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:24,740
already on drugs from

301
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,210
buy cheaper car but even apparently
teetotaler

302
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,020
you can't deny that they're important
interesting subject why would

303
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,670
any species what's up to us to the point
that cell proliferation

304
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:39,910
it decides the puzzle and therefore it's
really infection

305
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,620
so what scientists discovered about
drugs

306
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,770
and what I've done for drugs I'm sure
you all

307
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,200
think about have a code

308
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,010
sends et cetera a lot find more
interesting if the way drugs have

309
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:53,029
influence science

310
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,880
starting with Nobel Prizes there are
many rumors

311
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,139
that Francis Crick the cold winter the
Nobel Prize in 1962

312
00:18:01,139 --> 00:18:04,209
for Physiology or Medicine for his party
the structure D&A

313
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:07,350
there many rumors that he can inside
honesty

314
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:10,870
he was known to be a party animal it's
been a rumor it was published in The

315
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,510
Daily Mail

316
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:15,169
years ago were never really got to know
the truth because that now we know

317
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:19,159
for that this man cary mullis you
devised

318
00:18:19,159 --> 00:18:22,320
the polemics chain reaction we know for
a fact inherited

319
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:26,639
insight on acid glimmers chain reaction

320
00:18:26,639 --> 00:18:30,209
won him the Nobel Prize in 1992

321
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:33,230
and this is a truly ingenious innovation

322
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,440
in the nineteen eighties scientists have
an incredibly difficult time trying to

323
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:37,990
read

324
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:41,070
the language if DNA it was a incredibly

325
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:45,019
painfully slow laborious process a
thread a few min to get a

326
00:18:45,019 --> 00:18:49,610
four billion letters well Lee everyday
it one letter at a time

327
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,139
months and months and months today they
can read the genome a single species in

328
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:53,969
a single day

329
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,600
before her absolutely painfully

330
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,350
long time most insight take this trend

331
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:05,840
split it in two thousand a little bit
and he doesn't visually and then put

332
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,129
them back together and it truly was a
stroke of genius and he deserves a Nobel

333
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,360
prize because this is revolutionize
medicine

334
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:14,658
any got in flight into how to do this

335
00:19:14,659 --> 00:19:17,769
on LSD and he wrote that this in his
autobiography

336
00:19:17,769 --> 00:19:22,010
DNA chain coil they floated

337
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,870
learn blue and pink images electric
molecules injected themselves

338
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:30,459
somewhere between the mountain road and
I i

339
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:34,419
what's the most important words in this
club

340
00:19:34,419 --> 00:19:41,000
mountain road he was on acid while he
was driving

341
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,140
he was driving at night down a winding
mountain road

342
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,570
and his wife was asleep next to him this
year

343
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:51,789
photograph can't quite see it at the
very prankster keith is better hippies

344
00:19:51,789 --> 00:19:53,658
who drove around america taking acid

345
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:58,230
writing about it your ass and driving
taking at basically a double height 180

346
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:01,559
that thing pay routinely apparently now

347
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:05,220
let's not label carrying all other side
a hero because

348
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,350
ever since then baby nothing apart 6
going on tonight

349
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:14,350
beside climate change and a looking once
again

350
00:20:14,350 --> 00:20:18,129
so I think the people people are flawed
and sometimes smart people can thank

351
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:19,200
after nine thanks

352
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,380
now to somebody who is lot after nine

353
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,149
whatever country's greatest site that
their country daily founder

354
00:20:27,149 --> 00:20:30,168
while society through every day is

355
00:20:30,169 --> 00:20:33,309
truly by this country's greatest
products they produce this thing

356
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:37,529
the daily cath lab until he devised
those miners in this country and around

357
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:40,460
the world we're dying by the tens of
thousands due to come

358
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:43,899
collapse seems to me they would open and
explode

359
00:20:43,899 --> 00:20:47,559
resulting in the dust trousers people at
a time this

360
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:51,149
incredibly simple invention is basically
a wire mesh cage

361
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:55,379
that a circle play the flame to disallow
the controlled burning up the gas

362
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,630
and there's no question that there are
people in this room who are alive

363
00:20:58,630 --> 00:21:02,669
because at this invention it save the
lives I hope 100000 people

364
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:09,029
before he did that he was the world's
very first balloon addict he was in love

365
00:21:09,029 --> 00:21:10,409
with nitrous oxide

366
00:21:10,409 --> 00:21:14,289
he was working at a research institution
just outside Brazil

367
00:21:14,289 --> 00:21:17,750
a studying abroad and gases and what
potential

368
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,779
applications they had human health and
love you my small yourself doing that

369
00:21:22,779 --> 00:21:26,279
chrysalis then and perhaps field goal to
tie a hotbed

370
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:30,630
chemical consumption how hurt nitrous
oxide is incredibly important for three

371
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:31,690
reasons: ever won

372
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:35,380
the very first drug that was ever made
in the lab that was put into the human

373
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:36,870
brain until then

374
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,250
all drugs that people consume came from
plants or

375
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,070
file

376
00:21:41,070 --> 00:21:44,470
a another while source this is the very
first thing they did the last

377
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:47,499
Nyquist I think that the atmosphere
naturally

378
00:21:47,499 --> 00:21:50,759
but it had to be produced in the lab
using the new

379
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:55,110
schools the site chemistry great
actually be concentrated in isolated

380
00:21:55,110 --> 00:21:55,740
interesting

381
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:59,460
for never to three days

382
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:03,249
study for the very first particle
investigational drug in effect

383
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:08,320
he 10 very detailed very careful records
how much better come out as friends to

384
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,350
what the effects were and how they
influence all

385
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:15,168
and number three in this is the most
important thing this eventually led to

386
00:22:15,169 --> 00:22:16,549
get that anaesthesia

387
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,418
pain free surgery until that all we had
to dull the pain

388
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,950
any kinda surgical intervention was
booth made him a little bite

389
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,169
this eventually led to the proliferation
of things like car for my tears as used

390
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:30,019
in dental

391
00:22:30,019 --> 00:22:33,279
surgery and all other chemicals that are
not today

392
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,940
giving up the opportunity to have
surgery without knowing what's happening

393
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:40,690
again there's no question that there are
people in this room were alive because

394
00:22:40,690 --> 00:22:41,419
if this

395
00:22:41,419 --> 00:22:45,419
now obligated quite realize it at the
time

396
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:49,029
what he thought he was doing was probing
the border between consciousness

397
00:22:49,029 --> 00:22:53,320
and subconscious this life and death he
thought he was exploring the hinterlands

398
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,070
of the night

399
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,710
it your investigation what it meant to
be self-aware and he loved it

400
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:03,039
and like kids today he made love to hold
here this is a thoughtful than that he

401
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:03,639
made

402
00:23:03,639 --> 00:23:06,740
that and entombed by a wire cage

403
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:10,299
at my favorite thing that he made it was
basically a giant pot

404
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:15,200
that like the dead share and we get 5%
off when you haven't

405
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,789
public polka I one occasion you thought
there for about an hour

406
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:23,730
and inhale about eighty ports nitrous
oxide

407
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,159
just put enabling lover today show a

408
00:23:27,159 --> 00:23:28,980
kid today at Berklee

409
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,419
think that they never amateurs discuss
pro

410
00:23:32,419 --> 00:23:37,160
leave him a scientist do it right as
like burger business today

411
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:41,040
he wrote that was it are salient things
nothing like this

412
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:44,970
but boss the universe is composed of
impressions I

413
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:50,090
to you pleasures and pain one thing
about every day that I like a lot

414
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,309
if that test everything ever
experimented on

415
00:23:53,309 --> 00:23:56,730
on cell first even before he gave it to
an animal

416
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,510
before giving it to spread everything to
himself her

417
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,720
and then we decided it was fun say

418
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,330
he would share it spread and he had
parties to the cool cats at the day

419
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,480
and they also have got rained out Robert
so poet laureate for four years

420
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,809
I am sure the air in heaven must be this

421
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,530
wonder working capital lights than your
callers

422
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:23,410
and on Mango closer anonymous

423
00:24:23,410 --> 00:24:27,600
I felt like the sound of Bihar this man

424
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,699
osco all said in fewer words what other
people attempted to capture in 100 words

425
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:36,850
as this is what I've well

426
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,879
I knew everything now 5 K

427
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,549
from the lab K pick something fun take
for ever

428
00:24:44,549 --> 00:24:48,230
and this is a pattern repeated profile
pic history

429
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:51,900
site isolate something people enjoy and
it out

430
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:57,100
the world next up okay the active
ingredient in coca leaves

431
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:01,129
if you choose coca leaves it just gives
you a better had it's not like doing a

432
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,390
Miami skyline

433
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:05,830
the active ingredient was not isolated

434
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:12,020
1850 by a German have it and after the
isolated it's that basically if I love

435
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:15,100
art or sell for about 20 years and no I
really paid any attention to it

436
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,889
Intel your friend and I'm

437
00:25:18,890 --> 00:25:22,350
segment Friday Sigmund Freud came along

438
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:27,570
pick it up but and he became arguably
whether all very first time head

439
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:32,230
and he would step all night for days and
weeks taking cocaine writing about how

440
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:33,549
amazing her care

441
00:25:33,549 --> 00:25:37,270
you heard the cocaine is really good for
creativity I really like a candle or

442
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:38,090
cocaine and

443
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:41,110
he did for a couple years in the
published a book called Cooper

444
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:45,780
Kaka and before he decided that the
clitoris is childish may want to have

445
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,820
sex with your mother

446
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,230
he was the roads very first cokehead get
up Sigmund Freud

447
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,540
always the charmer that book along with
a few other side

448
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:58,049
reveling in what he called the most
gorgeous excitement

449
00:25:58,049 --> 00:26:01,770
the chemical lead participation in
mainstream society

450
00:26:01,770 --> 00:26:05,520
so the Victorian conducted cocaine

451
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,650
into everything they could get their
hands on it was sold in Paris

452
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:12,200
it was sold at drakes it was sold in K
for children

453
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,830
but I find incredibly counter-intuitive
there were other

454
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:19,860
posters for children but poor soul that
contained opium which I think makes more

455
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:24,820
that a this is my favorite cocaine
containing product from the day

456
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,510
this is a wind up with 10 percent
alcohol eight-percent cocaine and

457
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:31,690
receive the blessing at the pump the

458
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:35,980
and Queen Victoria was that bad as well
as to american president

459
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,200
bad very on

460
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,690
now 5 typically this was very important
because the proliferation of drugs in

461
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:45,429
their ingestion by scientists and the
public alike

462
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:48,900
eventually led to the discovery
neurotransmitters

463
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:51,929
neurotransmitters are the chemicals in
the human mind

464
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:55,480
that are basically molecular messengers
there what sells used to talk to each

465
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:55,929
other

466
00:26:55,929 --> 00:27:00,040
see her the name to these for dopamine
serotonin of the toes and

467
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:04,990
it wasn't you can argue that we only
discovered them because

468
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:09,570
the human tendency to take drugs and
this is why most drugs

469
00:27:09,570 --> 00:27:13,379
work by mimicking the neurotransmitters
in your body so I'm not looking quite

470
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:16,679
see it on the left that the molecule
south side and within

471
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:20,480
magic mushrooms on the right start on it
they look

472
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,860
shockingly similar and that's how magic
mushrooms work

473
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,370
if they fit into the key holes in your
mind that are designed

474
00:27:27,370 --> 00:27:30,668
for serotonin and in fact they fit into
those key hole

475
00:27:30,669 --> 00:27:34,820
better insert heart itself lst work the
same way

476
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:39,370
masculine it's basically botanical her
they basically law

477
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,320
picture detail it really quite
impressive be very and

478
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,428
scientist in the nineteenth century were
puzzled as to how drugs could work

479
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:52,240
so this is how to trade about what
happened something made by a plant

480
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,660
or by holders work inside the human body
it doesn't really make sense

481
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,900
and so when they started to investigate
how they work

482
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:04,610
this leather down a chemical detective
trail to fighting the receptor

483
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:10,149
okay the very first time this happened
nicotine was first isolated in 1843

484
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:15,169
it wasn't until the nineteen seventy
that scientists found a receptor for it

485
00:28:15,169 --> 00:28:18,980
and this your cell normally binds to the
air transmitter

486
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:22,370
holy when they fell to earth after they
need it

487
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,409
actor 50

488
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:28,260
it's called panic attack Cooper scepter
the pattern continues the active

489
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:29,520
ingredient cannabis

490
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:33,830
was first isolated in 1964
endocannabinoid

491
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:37,600
are all no transmitters were not found
collecting 9

492
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:40,600
are more P 18 0

493
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,300
by it to a hundred and seventy years for
scientists to track down

494
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:50,690
endorphins which is not working minutes
and this is my favorite example

495
00:28:50,690 --> 00:28:55,320
it might be possible to never understood
the role that sir colin has in the brain

496
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,530
if it wasn't for a lusty

497
00:28:56,530 --> 00:29:01,450
and this is why eighty percent of the
serotonin in your body is contained in

498
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:01,830
your

499
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:06,030
got not your break as a scientist and
think that they are kinda had a role in

500
00:29:06,030 --> 00:29:06,470
life

501
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:11,070
however a couple scientist worries
wrecked car and our degree

502
00:29:11,070 --> 00:29:14,360
they had expert difficulty they knew

503
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,740
that I love the looks like serotonin so
they carded

504
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:22,300
hell thousand liters how blood to the
laboratory Baltimore to isolate the

505
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,240
active ingredients

506
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,710
and their demonstrated that serotonin
has a role in the break

507
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:30,800
now I'm sure all you're familiar with
SSRI antidepressants

508
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:34,360
these are the most popular former
treating depression in human species

509
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:37,110
which as we all know is one of our most
intractable killers

510
00:29:37,110 --> 00:29:40,209
it arguable that we would never have
developed a

511
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:43,800
if it wasn't for the resemblance between
LFT and serotonin

512
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,990
and again there's no question that there
are people in this room or alive because

513
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:47,850
it these drugs

514
00:29:47,850 --> 00:29:52,510
now let's get to the invention LSD that
this is what I science's greatest art

515
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,930
this is Albert Hoffman the man who made
a lefty

516
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,260
he was not a hippie he was a with nerd

517
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:03,600
he was the biggest nerd governor to
dinner and she work

518
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,790
41 company his whole life he worked for
senator

519
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,399
chemicals in Zurich Switzerland and he
never took drugs until he made a nifty

520
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,490
I he took it you follow up with that

521
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:18,800
and he took it until midnight say and
you live in talking with a 102

522
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,540
a hundred to that what is 100 birthday

523
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,730
about got an advertisement I'm not quite
sure what so

524
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:30,040
what happened what he was working away
at the lab he was studying

525
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:33,200
Beach High 10 molecules up crustacean

526
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:37,010
and he studied the purpura up quiet

527
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:40,820
and just reading a synthetic analogs
something what to think he was really

528
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,559
trying to do

529
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:46,510
he got about this crystal on his fingers
and that he rode a bicycle home he

530
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:47,379
started to trip

531
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:51,950
and this is the world's very first asked
Rep that what do you think it was really

532
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:52,410
tried

533
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:55,530
dude is anyone here know K

534
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:59,760
was a problem either back he was trying
to make treatment for pregnant women

535
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:02,850
he was trying to create drugs that would
stop postcard

536
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:06,790
hemorrhaging at that women in childbirth
that was mingle

537
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,920
and he spent almost his entire life
pursuing this call and it back to

538
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,610
develop something called matter to you

539
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:14,610
still today when the most widely used
drugs in us after

540
00:31:14,610 --> 00:31:19,169
and the reason he developed a lusty is
because there's this thing at Colby air

541
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:22,850
fungus this is a plot parasite bogus and
in fact

542
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:27,850
Rai and people consume large quantities
that this could have happened routinely

543
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:31,209
throughout European history for the past
1000 years they can suffer from

544
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:31,940
something called

545
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:36,809
argyll poisoning and it file and it
kills the largest mass killing was about

546
00:31:36,809 --> 00:31:38,889
50,000 people in applique

547
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,300
the last part mass outbreak up this
fungus was in 1926 in Russia

548
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:47,820
and the working with very severe you had
experience with the nation's

549
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:52,780
delusions fever I gangrene there
reported incidents a peasant's what

550
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:56,330
all four limbs drop off that's why the
heads and feet hanging

551
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:59,830
about the same the victims of this
former poisoning

552
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:03,020
have their own state because it is
considered to be so on

553
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:07,650
other the homework should be able to
create synthetic analogs up this fungus

554
00:32:07,650 --> 00:32:09,710
why because midwife new

555
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,700
that a small doses prepared the right
way you could use this fungus to prevent

556
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,980
postpartum hemorrhaging

557
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:18,679
and also to induce miscarriages or
abortions at preferred

558
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,139
so he wanted to make something that
would allow for the prevention of

559
00:32:22,139 --> 00:32:23,309
postpartum hurting

560
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:26,799
but without the horrible side effects
stations and fever

561
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:31,220
so if you ever anything after it comes
from a parasite

562
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:34,620
originally at that has its own Saints
and it was born in the quest to find

563
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,699
remedies for women now

564
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,570
after haha experienced this drug he
declared

565
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,009
lol he could be for psychiatry but the
microscope was for biology and Italian

566
00:32:45,009 --> 00:32:49,350
the scope for astronomy and this method
time anything so powerful

567
00:32:49,350 --> 00:32:52,799
they can bend the line so that a lot
teachers as any of you

568
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,908
may know from genetics for example to
understand how something works

569
00:32:55,909 --> 00:32:59,169
you break a bit and see what happens
knockout mice for example

570
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:03,809
engineering thing principal so he wanted
other thing to be used in meaningful

571
00:33:03,809 --> 00:33:05,740
therapeutic ways to treat

572
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,440
the human condition and to understand
how the mind works however

573
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,210
like okay and like doctors before lst
escaping a lot

574
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,830
into the world and beat him very very
popular and the rest is history

575
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,759
and authorities obviously we're very
worried about

576
00:33:20,759 --> 00:33:25,669
counterculture and amassing some this
drug in I'm control settings and

577
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,409
whether or not you're a federal St ever
seen anybody lose their minds to it

578
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:32,919
if you've ever met at casualty somebody
from the 60's or 70's him

579
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:36,610
walked through the door and there I've
never came back you would worry too

580
00:33:36,610 --> 00:33:40,559
there's a guy Francisco his name is the
birdcage Manor

581
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,668
anywhere the bird cage on its head and
homeless and lost his mind about forty

582
00:33:44,669 --> 00:33:45,159
years

583
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:48,470
so there with my where

584
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,400
on therapeutic use a psychedelic on
people

585
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,120
for a long time sign really well
respected reefer truck animals

586
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,770
the whole history and animal research at
psychedelic law a very powerful

587
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:02,900
at the lot in my book this one most
famous study

588
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:06,210
this is very interesting not taken quite
see it clearly

589
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,290
but these experiments were by Nasser

590
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,699
like you may have seen this image before
spider webs

591
00:34:12,699 --> 00:34:15,719
produced under the influence of
different drugs and you may have seen it

592
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:16,299
and thought

593
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,100
it was just a minute rated by some guy
in the graphics department by selecting

594
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:20,719
or whatever

595
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:24,689
no no no these are real studies in the
nineteen seventies police were funded by

596
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:28,139
nasa the safety very agency the

597
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:33,239
a man on the moon Cedros fired try to
get an idea of how toxic they wear

598
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:36,669
what's fascinating is that the caffeine
web which is bottom right

599
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:39,670
is the most messed up want it make
absolutely no said

600
00:34:39,670 --> 00:34:43,500
the marijuana what you can't quite see
it and that hot left

601
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,030
fighter I knew what it was doing that
for basically gave up halfway through

602
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:51,350
and then you can see bottle FPL

603
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:55,040
the web potentially lawler but it me
broad

604
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:59,490
make about what well now

605
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:03,529
while scientists were experimenting on
animal here is a man who did not

606
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,380
experiments on animals and no discussion
at the history of science and drug for

607
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,600
the complete that this man

608
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,190
Alexander Shogun artificial good as the
mandate the world MD&A

609
00:35:13,190 --> 00:35:16,980
artificial granite was a chemist
biochemistry

610
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:21,920
fight he was working for Dow Chemical
and he was making pesticide act be made

611
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:22,490
to the world

612
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:26,160
very first biodegradable cups and past
on

613
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:30,640
these 15-18 independently wealthy cell
eventually he was able to spend

614
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,940
forty years in a shed in his car making

615
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:37,590
drugs recently started doing yes is
because

616
00:35:37,590 --> 00:35:41,250
he was given sample a chemical 51
obstructed

617
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,690
when he was at berkeley and this
chemical with MDMA

618
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:47,690
for synthesizing in 1914 by Merck

619
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:52,180
in fact no one really knows what
happened to it but they gave it a few

620
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:55,339
animals in the nineteen places and
things to do anything interesting and

621
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:59,980
the kinda like witness security somehow
it got a counterculture and we don't

622
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,210
really know how to preserve that

623
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:05,850
CIA was using it to investigate
potential as a truth there

624
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,850
on psychiatric patients in Canada in a
program called

625
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:13,549
mk-ultra somebody might no one really
knows for sure but if I

626
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:16,740
the counter-culture there but cases
other floating around the club scene in

627
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:17,879
New York and what not

628
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:22,550
and one of his students got her hands on
some and she had to have it she said

629
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:26,310
try this and he did over well

630
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:30,299
what he did that was special he figured
out how to make

631
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:34,060
because until he came along no one knew
what the molecular structure was

632
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:37,460
or how could produce people love

633
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:41,220
active making new chemicals and he spent
the next four years

634
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:44,930
making it New drugs he did it act out
for a few years

635
00:36:44,930 --> 00:36:48,140
but then they got tired of this drug
pursuits like to set up a lot and

636
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:52,730
garden people carmaker photograph
basically composed enough bottles and

637
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:53,300
job

638
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:58,190
and homemade tubes and wires what about
10 or so then is that right

639
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,350
everything on himself her he did not
commit to animals

640
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:07,730
he was a gentleman and every thought the
drive was good and the bad

641
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,650
to reply

642
00:37:10,650 --> 00:37:15,310
and if he thought it was good they would
give it to their friends that he created

643
00:37:15,310 --> 00:37:18,890
more than who thousand chemicals

644
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,509
when he tried to also I'll be about $200
per cycle active including TCP

645
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:29,680
to CE TCI a weird one called doin it
only affects the years it's basically a

646
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,460
hallucination

647
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:34,560
for your auditory system but nah I
fascinating and

648
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,610
where he was worried that the CIA were
trying to down published everything in

649
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:39,370
the queue but

650
00:37:39,370 --> 00:37:42,400
once called P college hockey covert

651
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,880
eight hundred pages long they're
basically chemical cookbooks if you're

652
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:48,420
online now you can get on are a wake-up
call

653
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,150
grr Wiid and you can find the recipe for
every what's interesting is that every

654
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:56,150
single client a drug-infested

655
00:37:56,150 --> 00:37:59,410
it was a hundred percent we go because
it was brand new

656
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:02,859
right there was no regulation on
anything you can think he basically made

657
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,570
rugs

658
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:08,870
for forty years until he died in May and
he doesn't like David a defect got that

659
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,520
that for a fact that for a long time
kinda could only really investigate the

660
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,550
use of drugs

661
00:38:14,550 --> 00:38:18,860
animal until today we are now very think
that sometimes

662
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:23,000
for calling the psychedelic Renaissance
a lot of psychiatrists and

663
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:27,310
neuroscientist logging the government
and university for years and years in

664
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,230
some cases forty

665
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,380
years to get to let and Planning
Commission

666
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:36,060
and funding to study impact psychedelic
human mind why

667
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:41,110
because all brothers alright so you're
talking about alcohol caffeine nicotine

668
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:44,800
and MA every single drug it's a
double-edged sword it has

669
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:45,760
good properties

670
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,390
bad company it's about how to use it and
when

671
00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,240
and why and so there now conducting
proper double-blind study

672
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,729
on people to investigate therapeutic
effect okay well the first ones

673
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:02,140
lol be a copperhead it cluster headaches
are known to be incredibly painful

674
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:06,670
it's one of the very few forms a pain
that happens the hits that might work

675
00:39:06,670 --> 00:39:10,530
back to suicide people who suffer from
these forms a headache

676
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:14,290
had yeah be could treat their pay

677
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:17,600
and they felt all life forms about this
like a dude have you tried to ask my

678
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,370
headache went away

679
00:39:18,370 --> 00:39:23,150
blah blah they'll all be the american
government to have that drug legally

680
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,480
investigated for their

681
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:27,610
potential and they want they want crowd
source

682
00:39:27,610 --> 00:39:30,710
drug investigation due to recreational
activity

683
00:39:30,710 --> 00:39:34,410
there are many other drugs like to point
out for a further 30 get back to using

684
00:39:34,410 --> 00:39:37,490
magic mushrooms to help people quit
smoking this is in Baltimore

685
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:41,479
using Palace I've been to help treat
obsessive-compulsive disorder people who

686
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,270
described himself to the point

687
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:46,670
where where this going down to the point
they leader worth no way

688
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:51,340
okay cool so having depression and email
50 ft

689
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,870
healthy alcoholism the list goes on and
on the could psychedelics be

690
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:59,549
for the mind that the telescope was for
astronomy maybe

691
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,500
most famous drug side as in this country
drugs are an important part of our

692
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:04,840
evolutionary history

693
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,960
and we cannot ignore them now and is
that through my

694
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:12,320
very favorite subject music music is
never broken my heart

695
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,490
whole day at my friends and this is my
absolute favorite a fourth recess

696
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:19,350
that we're going to look at what
scientists have found about music you

697
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,089
have to ask

698
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:23,550
what is the effect right what is music
probably difficult to define

699
00:40:23,550 --> 00:40:27,390
here the definition organized sound well
along pocket organizer

700
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:30,400
sound and i felt really music summer
call that

701
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:35,250
beautiful math it is beautiful at its
mathematical but many forms mathematics

702
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:36,060
are not musical

703
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:39,270
the back definition is it is new with it
aleutian

704
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,150
in a loser

705
00:40:40,150 --> 00:40:43,270
exist in your mind that exist only in
your mind

706
00:40:43,270 --> 00:40:46,600
and the way that I can explain that this
condition whole

707
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:51,920
a new Zea which means no music people
who have been using it don't hear

708
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,660
with other people here for some people
here crescendos and beautiful symphonies

709
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,629
and pleasing part

710
00:40:56,630 --> 00:40:59,850
bear disjointed noise it doesn't mean
anything to them

711
00:40:59,850 --> 00:41:02,610
and their use is nothing wrong with
their hearing their brain just doesn't

712
00:41:02,610 --> 00:41:04,410
do the computational magic

713
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:07,609
that I got on and everybody else to
create the perception that music

714
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,830
and four percent of the human population
has you

715
00:41:10,830 --> 00:41:14,830
and most people having you don't know
they have it but they don't know what it

716
00:41:14,830 --> 00:41:16,259
felt like to other people

717
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:21,080
you can go online University of Montreal
at McGill in Montreal they have online

718
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,960
who discovered her one of the four
percent

719
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:27,850
you be in good company whether most
famous as the sky che guevara

720
00:41:27,850 --> 00:41:31,029
probably heading hit music and you could
tell the difference between

721
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,330
a shower so what's going on in the rest
of us

722
00:41:34,330 --> 00:41:37,509
as you're probably familiar with there
are more possible connections between

723
00:41:37,510 --> 00:41:38,600
neurons in your head

724
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:42,680
there universe a complicated thing in
the universe is inside your skull

725
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:46,279
and when you're look but what does

726
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:50,210
on inside starving people listen to
music they found made me think they

727
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:50,680
found

728
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:55,210
it engages everything apart your brain
more than any other human activity

729
00:41:55,210 --> 00:41:58,680
more than language for the mathematics
more than anything you can do

730
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,440
you cut it every corner and her head
from top to bottom front to back

731
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:06,390
the major structures such as the court
acted campus memory

732
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:10,310
everything my favorite it also touches
so-called primitive

733
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:13,830
structures such as your brain stem and
your cerebellum parts of your brain

734
00:42:13,830 --> 00:42:17,590
sheriff reptile response to music but
not spoken language

735
00:42:17,590 --> 00:42:18,260
or red

736
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,700
noise moreover we'll listen to music
triggers the release

737
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:25,700
chemicals such as dopamine and orphaned
same chemicals are released by

738
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:29,060
cocaine and by other drugs do not know
okay

739
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:32,610
all you need is Mark A your iPod
auditory sex toy

740
00:42:32,610 --> 00:42:36,360
dating back to anything moreover
anthropologists have found

741
00:42:36,360 --> 00:42:41,240
that all human cultures make music know
every human culture has a number 0

742
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:44,720
not every culture has our agriculture
architecture

743
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,410
writing stratified social structures
every human culture makes music

744
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:54,049
moreover it appears to be although her
covered artifact her

745
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,080
was a pollute this is the femur other
bear

746
00:42:57,080 --> 00:43:02,160
its financial media and scientists have
created a replica of it

747
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:06,790
at what it will look like a large-scale
it make the dough over 85 scale

748
00:43:06,790 --> 00:43:11,670
and this is forty thousand years all so
we may put forty thousand years ago

749
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:15,130
how much longer we make end runs files I
just think

750
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:18,590
so if music is something that we've
evolved to do it ancient

751
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:23,200
how might that have evolved could happen
that benefits like before

752
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,439
what is the most obvious that there to
%uh

753
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:31,980
that happen great actor and I will get
that that is not a copy of that type

754
00:43:31,980 --> 00:43:32,340
that

755
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:37,930
yeah back darn thought so I've heard
that musical notes and brother were

756
00:43:37,930 --> 00:43:41,730
first required by the male or female
progenitors up my eyes to take a

757
00:43:41,730 --> 00:43:43,290
charming the opposite effect

758
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:47,720
there's one very quick story out of a
history of rock n roll does anyone here

759
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,660
with the very first

760
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:52,279
a I'm side it might like that file

761
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,470
that at there you know at the very first
thing

762
00:43:55,470 --> 00:44:00,509
Pamela Anderson said tell me the last
she saw the party slot up to second

763
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:01,670
ahead and fix that

764
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:05,360
I will fuck any driver that says it all

765
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:10,100
creating girls we're classy if nothing
else however the laptop accessories

766
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:11,259
social bonding

767
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,680
we are social creatures and we navigate
all world with music to create social

768
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,830
bonds with each other

769
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:20,279
its for masonic navigation

770
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,200
and have found that one simple thing
inquires this triggers the release a fox

771
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:26,450
ito said this is the same hormone
release

772
00:44:26,450 --> 00:44:30,279
by or gathered by breastfeeding and this
is not a lease when you sing

773
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,380
fellow it thought that this facilitates
sabado

774
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:36,369
moreover if we didn't have social
bonding and if we didn't have music

775
00:44:36,369 --> 00:44:38,520
never would have been able to create the
pyramids

776
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,730
if we couldn't go how ppl and do it
together in time

777
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:46,020
we never would have created the world
ancient monuments so

778
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:49,900
but West could be helped form large
complex aside

779
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,349
it music free day way the complication

780
00:44:53,349 --> 00:44:58,299
removable language without a with the
human that music

781
00:44:58,299 --> 00:45:01,540
fire last quite 1 minute left over

782
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:08,540
do animals make music ever made he is a
crap kinda music what animal make adult

783
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:11,410
bee

784
00:45:11,410 --> 00:45:15,920
%uh hey sell their verify his wife
investigated

785
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,849
a real so he took marmosets his name
suspect are met

786
00:45:19,849 --> 00:45:24,190
he was the club DJ and then it became a
neuroscientist 30 take

787
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:27,240
adorable little market that and if your
lab animal

788
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,368
and you've got like some armor sets next
door who are having drugs experimented

789
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:31,760
on the more you like into

790
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:35,579
music marmoset love I wanna be in that
lab he made him a maze

791
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:39,369
it today but you can't quite see it he
basically made that was made and you put

792
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,920
different speakers at the end

793
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,549
different titles in place in different
genres of music it's basically like a

794
00:45:44,549 --> 00:45:44,990
multi

795
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:48,680
room rate from arms that that he could
tell by where they went

796
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:52,270
like the paper particle techno arise

797
00:45:52,270 --> 00:45:57,180
you name it played what can you do you
think they like time attacking a

798
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:57,868
possible

799
00:45:57,869 --> 00:46:00,280
rockwell

800
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:02,200
Joe now

801
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:05,730
now yesterday the highway no matter what

802
00:46:05,730 --> 00:46:09,720
the marmoset always preferred silent
they just on the irritating

803
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:13,419
because they're great importance in the
matter or break their for this website

804
00:46:13,420 --> 00:46:14,569
scientist to say

805
00:46:14,569 --> 00:46:18,549
well human therefore must be the only
creature that makes music

806
00:46:18,549 --> 00:46:21,400
and that other scientists said well
that's ridiculous Wales and birds are

807
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:23,269
very complex on a communication

808
00:46:23,269 --> 00:46:26,479
it might not be what we do but that
doesn't mean it's not music

809
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:30,339
and this led to a backup for a very long
very boring argument but about a a

810
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:34,640
at one side truck collided with that is
that okay other animals might make sales

811
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:35,779
we're the only ones

812
00:46:35,779 --> 00:46:38,809
offensive rather when he further this
angered

813
00:46:38,809 --> 00:46:42,640
a lot of people the public and I gotta
learning anything else people say

814
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:47,308
yeah my dog pup tent souped-up editor at
and he said

815
00:46:47,309 --> 00:46:50,769
by if you have had you live in San Diego
area

816
00:46:50,769 --> 00:46:55,078

I'll and

817
00:46:55,079 --> 00:47:01,750
is do

818
00:47:01,750 --> 00:47:08,750
dollars

819
00:47:18,770 --> 00:47:20,290
do

820
00:47:20,290 --> 00:47:24,130

Boys and Michael Jackson

823

ever

825
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,060
so that brings us to the end so what if
we fast we have found that

826
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:47,590
other animal have a capacity keep time
but no animal really does what we do we

827

00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:53,620
we are also be drug yes monkey other
animals might help those that we have

829
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,200

special heart at the human condition

these criminal activities have led
homicide thou discovery

835
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,270
about what it means to be human and how
the universe works

hedonistic impulsive have informed
intellectual pursuits
