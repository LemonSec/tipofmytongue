rock get off nine fights

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,239
welcome up my name's Tim on head of
research

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,979
my colleague Mike com help me on this
page to research phase is complete

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:23,400
chipping in where he feels of miss
things autonomy Mikey sure it doesn't

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,750
get sidetracked by the cast

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:29,859
as you'll see United his presentation
sign

7
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:33,870
well this topic is what they sell to be
around are what he texted

8
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,169
how we test a what we found white spot

9
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:44,170
so what we actually test it was an
off-the-shelf divorce from

10
00:00:44,839 --> 00:00:47,860
coming over in the sites on time server

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,330
it's fair to cite the historically

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:55,909
the papal St 4 what Justin and keep a
package in their system

13
00:00:55,909 --> 00:00:59,589
but the white like by the companies
restructured I no longer have back

14
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:00,170
hopefully

15
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,400
I decided by .1 probably not the best
decision I ever made

16
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,000
I will discuss wanna love palm all the
spots beam

17
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,170
this place the famed hom the vendor

18
00:01:12,170 --> 00:01:15,610
arm is how you might see a conference
call with us to discuss

19
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:19,409
arm what to do next because leveraged

20
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,060
files to get back to us on the people's

21
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,060
published in sight but they're coming up
on our website 9

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:29,619
are the vendors a little upset about
that a fortune by Tim

23
00:01:29,619 --> 00:01:36,619
to get back to us within the requisite
signals was it something stupid

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:42,908
before halftime sir are you can see
occurred less than pass such a tight

25
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:44,439
compartment vendor's website

26
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:49,059
a forgery called who were tested for
armpit if you think about it anybody

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,429
either

28
00:01:49,429 --> 00:01:52,579
needs to have ac time last two trading

29
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:56,708
are defense arm medical purposes
whatever is the

30
00:01:56,709 --> 00:02:00,909
only tiny tonight the clocks they reason
for their systems are correct

31
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:07,740
so the attack surface is the device will
attack if you mention it was a typical

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,068
one you system

33
00:02:09,068 --> 00:02:12,339
army Happy St had cereal network course

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,500
arm housing buttons on the front page
one point resting

35
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,000
have management network have a
production network

36
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,950
I'm a handsome authorized applications
with line two

37
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,670
configure on Sep are probably

38
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:30,260
outside the mountains and faces one
exactly required but I am

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,379
if you buy something off the shelf
things that people expect a fluffy into

40
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:40,379
fights sign in terms of physical attack
surface what we look to

41
00:02:40,629 --> 00:02:44,858
on 4 select USB on that have a number in
shitty properties

42
00:02:44,859 --> 00:02:47,920
are to thanks are allow

43
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,319
configurations to are and potentially
could be used for performs

44
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:56,170
you think about are its as you can see
there MontaVista Linux

45
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,470
are hopefully it's just a standard USB

46
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:05,130
implementation on Linux sup physical

47
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:08,168
arm we look to what the serial

48
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:11,180
devices putting up a time compound with
my

49
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,569
allowed console access are we didn't see
anything particularly interesting June 3

50
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,149
we have seen devices where for example
is leaked information

51
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:21,980
allowed us to pass the time how the
eighth floor implementation is

52
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,578
functioning

53
00:03:22,579 --> 00:03:26,599
all and indeed a one per ticket for we
have too much secrecy

54
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:29,750
be used to safety I S law which was
quite fun

55
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:33,690
women hide exploited are in this
instance nothing particularly

56
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:34,280
interesting

57
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,120
are jury fate on in terms the console
accessible some however

58
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,200
on in terms of network access harmful to
people's land while outside

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,040
lan/wan I think what's the external
whole

60
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,870
allowed to use the management more arm
different services on by

61
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,430
by sounds actually quite good im
typically we often say the same serves

62
00:03:57,430 --> 00:03:58,970
as a present on the wind faces

63
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:03,320
for one side actually locked it down
discussed what the tax exactly like

64
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,790
in a couple slots time but it was better
than we did

65
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,790
so I physical arm

66
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:13,370
bombs months devices one-year

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,510
talk will have some color buttons on the
front even if it's just a light

68
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,988
see the time to locate the device sector
arm

69
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:23,710
in this particular instance are
ecosystem tension setting

70
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,919
Mike backups are indeed

71
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,050
it how the property where are you could
set the came

72
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:33,470
lot lo que a fortune that was a
convocation

73
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,240
was almost like a physical law if you
didn't remember to lock it

74
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:40,810
lot arm actually say fights

75
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:44,210
from the configuration dumps because it
wasn't marked on the department looking

76
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:45,539
at we're actually I

77
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,590
back pain jobs meant we could imply play
with price limit what they tell

78
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:54,409
site

79
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,600
logical on those weapons by switching
what's the little

80
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,660
second was SSI was S&M pay

81
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:05,470
I was postmaster house persons
particularly interesting model explain

82
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:06,630
why a second but it

83
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:10,990
on yet wouldn't necessarily expected see
posters listing on the neck

84
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:15,300
are with some inadvisable however in
this particular case it was there

85
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,850
yes so I'm

86
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,020
on the management there was a web
interface you often find a.m.

87
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,289
that's what it looks like the likes me
from the 1990s

88
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:29,820
we have to play MJ Costanza this is
clearly very proud of his name is

89
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,399
everywhere

90
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:34,729
the source code every page it was in
credentials as well will come across

91
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:35,609
those later

92
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:39,449
for yep that's it nothing what it looks
like if you don't write and you can find

93
00:05:39,449 --> 00:05:41,710
a few them about a.m.

94
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:48,270
mix yes i won

95
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:52,308
it was really good was fantastic yes
that's what we got there own love these

96
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:52,710
were

97
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:55,998
tribute to exploit there was literally
mitigation against anything

98
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:59,569
a so yeah the less units who cares

99
00:05:59,569 --> 00:06:03,069
there's an open the gate remote group
that I'm this proof-of-concept

100
00:06:03,069 --> 00:06:06,159
on ass i which is it for you xoxo
command

101
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:10,688
so if you come across one you're on it
you done it owns moved on

102
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:15,499
was a little bit about my first PHP
application which is a bit of a sign for

103
00:06:15,499 --> 00:06:16,009
device

104
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:21,099
want me 15 on yeah

105
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:28,099
semi-colon ID 0

106
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,820
exercise

107
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,849
harm pssh implementation slightly

108
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:36,810
different from what you might expect to
keep my around the x-box the past by how

109
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:37,960
to customize shell

110
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,940
on but it turns out having done a little
bit of digging into how the Shelborne

111
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:42,820
reluctantly

112
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,770
weekend engineering might and in fact if
you see the screen on

113
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:51,710
not sure he will be out soon but a
century follow suit arthur's actor Kamal

114
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,370
dejection

115
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:55,550
into the into the shell so the show

116
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,960
has a lock down so the approach allowed
to run are

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,930
it does include copy some not very well
down but it does haha :p

118
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,420
but the ride shocks for example the copy
more on the way

119
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,420
shocks the ire on fake sector century
satcher

120
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:13,710
me if you party passing a semi-colon at
a value of your choice

121
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,719
on you can't really get more execution
and

122
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,200
from you can actually get group because
the CD

123
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,390
configuration is itself pretty terrible
arm

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:27,330
his lap runners 3 I'm and it doesn't
require password

125
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,690
arm yeah out too late for wanted price I
guess

126
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,140
my expect that fairmont back
configuration

127
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:40,550
be applied to the web server it's
difficult I wanted to run things as re

128
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:47,550
my onto something for pretty much island

129
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,759
shelf right we were talking about site
Bri

130
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,759
an engineering bit extract from it. I

131
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,060
perhaps a bit lower getting the the
engineering might

132
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:00,110
are say so could be seen for many

133
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:03,410
system Florence as you can see we've got

134
00:08:03,410 --> 00:08:06,490
kweisi piano at home think fine for FIS

135
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,270
ultimately if you have a semicolon and
flash been flash crash

136
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,740
wherever Armalite execute month of your
choice

137
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:18,669
yeah I'm

138
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:22,000
looking at S&P was an era access but
with public

139
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,650
you could just pull off anything you
liked so as a lovely information

140
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:28,690
he slid

141
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,510
attempting to exploit I don't think

142
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:35,569
we look to see for any custom maps
couldn't find any

143
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,810
are also you know anywhere material
interest home

144
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,909
it's something that if you're looking a
embedded devices

145
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:46,330
problem because while you on features

146
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:53,330
all standard he said

147
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,810
we mention the house Christmas Eve I'll
apply for the network arm

148
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:02,189
acting kinda keep power 113 com

149
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:05,400
most def got ability to look at things
in a bit with a

150
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:09,050
it turns out hopefully where

151
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:12,740
harm of to fulsome

152
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:17,750
person charged demonstrated statistics
on the device him time

153
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,590
of deep job the credentials when

154
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:24,730
fact I concerns contagious right now and
it turns out

155
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,820
historic high scores when you've got a
problem

156
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:32,260
what's up 12 for using interesting

157
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:35,260
have another thanks by hiphop

158
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,270
thanks clearly what people would think
minimize your tax office in any way

159
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:40,540
shape or form alarm

160
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,370
yeah a lesson about how not to do things

161
00:09:44,370 --> 00:09:48,210
the next week comes

162
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:52,550
NT pay NTPC any services listing on the
production network

163
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,760
arm all

164
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,050
turns out NTP one thing to do

165
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,770
right make sure called in all the
surface you call

166
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:06,030
essentially send senator packwood

167
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:09,720
many it then mirrors of field original
target home

168
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,040
turns out in this case they got lateral
on this is by sublime

169
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:17,300
one 1i wanna should beware

170
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:24,300
I might let the moleste mas lives

171
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:27,290
side to side we aren't the box

172
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:31,060
hardware and the box pretty quickly
reaction go into the box in the first

173
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:31,430
instance

174
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,060
through the original dumping the
configuration from the buttons on the

175
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:35,489
from

176
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:38,560
arm from nap essential

177
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,619
ATC which is how I Russian we modified
and Andrea

178
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:47,500
I think it's a USB stick pointing out
the people credentials on the web

179
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,180
interface

180
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,199
yet deposit was already in my John file

181
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,740
I'm don't think it's the first time he's
been owned

182
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:59,260
say yes we got it we going to be fairly
trivial a

183
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:03,030
we saw some look at how the arresting

184
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,170
other settings Montevideo the next

185
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:10,490
at the fights hospitals by pump on a lot
of tweaking to Mikey how they want

186
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:15,680
NTP server we found secret instances
interesting box you next level

187
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,329
first will draw close any

188
00:11:19,330 --> 00:11:23,050
bachelor who saved if I can get free
soon

189
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,729
I could have a potential written written
files we found

190
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:30,200
obviously insecure seating configuration
itself which allowed us to

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,200
like counting re I guess ultimately who
cares

192
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:40,790
I guess is problem my simple this on

193
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:45,969
the offline clearly cares on perhaps not
as much as we do expected because their

194
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:47,190
injuries actual

195
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:51,190
Department in fighting this home tonight
will too fussed about the website

196
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,460
because yet they never happened
physically connected 20 haha

197
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:59,570
home lupus these particular walked the
halls items for

198
00:11:59,570 --> 00:12:03,640
commonly cited is being used to sing his
domestic deposits across the UK

199
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:06,660
are so ultimately you can imagine that

200
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,990
if I was to cost a time-sensitive they
need a claw

201
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:13,140
are possibly have been an actor across
the entire UK

202
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,480
my house and implications iPhone

203
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,730
this going so this going he's on the
money

204
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,790
I'm a member of harm the ninety people
here he met

205
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:24,180
camp

206
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,939
night is my next arm really like was a
discussion about what will be good NTP

207
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,550
server

208
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,620
to use for for the last pay and someone
mention Symmetricom

209
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,790
curiously than enough it was a sci-fi
are

210
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,319
we can certainly agree with them we have
want random

211
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,339
three or four times what we're working
on it fun I'm

212
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:47,100
no apparent reason not even the cases
were necessary to anything

213
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:54,100
offensive on it just seems like the
rebate ago

214
00:13:03,050 --> 00:13:08,630
any questions

215
00:13:08,630 --> 00:13:10,910
did you open a box of know for sure call

216
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:14,310
wasn't willing to let inside the box
they were intending to put this on the

217
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:15,518
network aside by

218
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:19,690
did not put the match went by so many
white on tonight I will let it slide

219
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,980
are happen downside we probably would
have gone off things far

220
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:27,829
he was obviously just the pace a sign
its gonna miss I'm

221
00:13:27,829 --> 00:13:30,920
accessissue on your desktop or laptop on

222
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:37,920
I probably not as interesting as it
might be a pain for example home

223
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:51,170
so the question was is this represents
tight upon a time surfer reno

224
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:55,060
both in study hall Thomson server
readers probably just wish to your

225
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:55,589
income

226
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:58,670
let Davion when I browse I'm

227
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:02,589
in terms of embedded devices i think is
pretty representative of the kinds of

228
00:14:02,589 --> 00:14:03,420
things we say

229
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:07,160
arm most of the stuff we do is for large
commercial

230
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:11,410
arm clients all of government employees
are

231
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:15,170
silo superstar she's quite thing I am in
beddy

232
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:19,890
stock are unite mind for each size
devices on uncommon for us to look at

233
00:14:19,890 --> 00:14:23,600
asking yeah the vulnerable is very

234
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,660
between vendors and devices depending on
the function for

235
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:33,660
ultimately hello outs in the cons box

236
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,440
90 questions well thanks very much
insurance today met camp
