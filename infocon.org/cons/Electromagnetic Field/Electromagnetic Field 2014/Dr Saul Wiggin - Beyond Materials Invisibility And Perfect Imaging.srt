1
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:11,610
hello

2
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,530
a

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:16,299
I'm going salty say about I'm something
called met me

4
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:17,759
ills I

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,220
so and the title is beyond materials
metamaterials

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:26,020
basically visa I'm artificially
engineered

7
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:29,250
materials which possess you know

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:32,680
unusual I'm proxies

9
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:38,830
and I'm done against them later in the
talk so

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,949
I'm this starts with

11
00:00:41,949 --> 00:00:45,379
am I'm science theory of general
relativity

12
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:50,070
so basically that's a sort of loose
mathematical

13
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,089
a framework where space and time

14
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:57,479
and is distorted by

15
00:00:57,479 --> 00:01:01,129
matter so got an example have a are

16
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,408
gravitational lens there where

17
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:08,560
the galaxy is are distorted by the black
hole in the center

18
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,180
so lenses go back a long time

19
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:16,960
and from sorta the start of civilization

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,619
a when I first discovered lands in 2000
BC

21
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm black holes

22
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:31,070
I'm also result from a

23
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:34,398
us singularity so this is this is all
relevant because this is the

24
00:01:34,399 --> 00:01:36,149
mathematical framework behind

25
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:39,520
transformation optics which is an
offshoot of

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,520
metamaterials a so

27
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,819
what is transformation optics basically

28
00:01:45,819 --> 00:01:49,350
I'm a penchant astronomy a

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,548
and you have firm thermal

30
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:59,969
cloaking I am so when the application's
is

31
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,320
I'm cloaking I am

32
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,000
so you can have them a close X I'm

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,199
cloaking for sound waves I'm

34
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,269
cloaking for matter where you a you see
equations

35
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,069
to you a cloak electrons going around

36
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,640
a ahead an insulating Shaw

37
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,779
so the there's a picture from there

38
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:31,200
I'm so

39
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,450
E its in is a is a nice

40
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:37,500
program to use I am

41
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,590
finite-difference time-domain I

42
00:02:40,590 --> 00:02:44,850
you use it in MATLAB to simulate

43
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:48,459
a electromagnetic waves I'm

44
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:53,750
so I've got some equations on the Rights

45
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,470
I am a

46
00:02:57,470 --> 00:03:01,690
so I'm on the left is the the rape on
the Rights

47
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:08,560
is the distorted right I'm talking to
show a

48
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:15,560
a best code

49
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:31,850
you know

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:44,160
and

51
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,470
so this is a simulation of the cloak I'm

52
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:52,070
you got the electromagnetic pulse from
the left

53
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:56,590
I am cloaking

54
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:00,070
a taking takes place there I'm

55
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,370
in there to singer region so I mean

56
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,110
in theory you know you coulda cloak
cloak anything I mean um

57
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:11,370
you've got sir

58
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,710
different methods you can a

59
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:19,299
cloaked tanks you in the infrared I'm

60
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:22,380
some people have tried to you

61
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:26,200
a you know use and projectors

62
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,920
protectors on a a screen that they're
wearing

63
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:35,430
to produce protects the image behind
them

64
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,530
so basically a

65
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,510
the you know invisible to you are

66
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,199
team and I

67
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,270
so what gives I'm these cloak say

68
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,330
interesting properties a things called
metamaterials

69
00:04:54,330 --> 00:04:58,438
so these a a electrical structures

70
00:04:58,439 --> 00:05:02,879
combination combinations uva to pastors
anims

71
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:06,360
a inductors I'm

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,979
they usually so we've split rings I'm

73
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:13,960
and here you know you've got

74
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,729
an example where I'm

75
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:24,729
Ste

76
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:31,750
a so mean you know click cloaking
service book mentions some

77
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,840
a sort of

78
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,590
applications and stuff already a so

79
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:42,119
I mean and innovation in the a

80
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,440
cloaking feels I suppose I am

81
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,680
which you know to my PhD on and stuff

82
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,830
is a to you cloak something

83
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:56,460
you know underneath I'm a carpet
effectively

84
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:59,539
scored like hiding something under
carpet

85
00:05:59,539 --> 00:06:03,580
I say this is our possible

86
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:08,419
a using an old I electric implementation
so

87
00:06:08,419 --> 00:06:12,130
is that if using an isotropic materials
you would use

88
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:15,639
on and ice

89
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:19,470
isotropic materials may differ a single
a

90
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:22,550
block dialect Rick a

91
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,789
so this technology is basically

92
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:30,919
I mean it's got some interesting a
applications Arbor

93
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:35,419
basis going to revolutionize you know
satellite communications

94
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:39,539
so currently

95
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:43,139
you know you've got antenna dishes a

96
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:46,570
that sorta parabolic and

97
00:06:46,570 --> 00:06:49,659
you can crates the flaps dishes

98
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:53,680
a so you saving

99
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,909
space I'm I'm Coston and things

100
00:06:57,909 --> 00:07:03,770
a.m.

101
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,169
so meet I've showed

102
00:07:05,169 --> 00:07:09,440
the video it's something fun to play
around immediate MATLAB

103
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,949
to you to run the codes I'm

104
00:07:12,949 --> 00:07:17,039
another interesting feature is a
negative refraction

105
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,719
so should conventional amnesty would
have

106
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,380
a fraction I and a negative

107
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,830
and index material you would have
negative refraction

108
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,440
so yes a well as the have

109
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,070
negative Charron Prof radiation I'm

110
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,690
which is the radiation from nuclear
reactors

111
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:43,219
pros a glows blue I'm

112
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:46,330
so

113
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,508
I wasn't able to show you the code which
is quite interesting

114
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:52,639
I'm sup mentioned it's got lots of for

115
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,560
applications and so you can design

116
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,120
thermo cloaks where your cloak aim
something

117
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,470
from heat basically

118
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,639
I'm a

119
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,229
so they've can have mechanical clothes

120
00:08:10,229 --> 00:08:16,830
see have negative compressibility I'm

121
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:20,169
just so it's basically sort of covering
not suffer

122
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:27,170
aspects really I am so I've mentioned
satellite communications

123
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:30,770
I'm unique transform flaps

124
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:34,199
a dishes to you a no

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,230
parabolic dish just flat dishes he can
also do that with lenses

126
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:41,180
so you can transform

127
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:44,790
a curved lenses to you a

128
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:50,199
flat lenses saving like space I'm and
cost for

129
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:54,140
a optical engine is I am

130
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:57,580
so you can

131
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:01,850
a de som fun sativa Fourier optics in

132
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:05,410
I'm calculate the reduction in

133
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:09,709
a the way fronts in assertive

134
00:09:09,710 --> 00:09:14,210
transformation optics lenses the

135
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:21,070
and I think that's that says

136
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:28,070
together any questions

137
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,310
it will be mostly work some microwaves
so

138
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,380
a lot of sex crimes Adams about aids
gags

139
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,750
I'm when you getting sorta optical
frequencies more difficult

140
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:49,750
and people tend to use silver a

141
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:56,970
dealings

142
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,890
fashion

143
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:04,439
ones me

144
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,680
yes yes a I mean that's why the

145
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,130
sort of methodologies moved to wait from
Matt materials which have negative

146
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:11,820
refraction

147
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,740
that to you transformation optics where
you kind of having an isotropic

148
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:20,950
a material say a you could do you

149
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:24,160
the a similar lands but

150
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:31,160
a it would be an isotropic

151
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,829
I'm you can use silver I mean it's it's
quite lossy

152
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:41,160
I like i say i mean it's easier to you
replace them with

153
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,560
transformation optics media which is
kind of like I'm isotropic

154
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,369
a said and you could do that with

155
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:53,230
something like there's a phone call
barium titanate foam

156
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,550
so you sorta is is a fireman and you
know you

157
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:59,569
the you have a distribution particles in
the fire him

158
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:06,570
which gives it variation of permittivity

159
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,140
what is generally blocks I mean you you
dissed

160
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,960
the discretized a the map and you

161
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:19,010
save got blocks a single permittivity

162
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:26,010
materials a yeah I mean as long as this
morn wavelength

163
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:41,879
to your questions

164
00:11:50,170 --> 00:11:53,899
the so basically it's made from

165
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:57,540
is a resident phenomenon so a

166
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:01,829
basically you've got a the permittivity
and permeability

167
00:12:01,829 --> 00:12:05,008
I which combined gives you the negative
refraction

168
00:12:05,009 --> 00:12:09,139
a so by using a split ring resonator

169
00:12:09,139 --> 00:12:12,509
a you at

170
00:12:12,509 --> 00:12:15,730
the resonance frequency you gets am

171
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:18,759
a narrowband region where

172
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,160
a you know you've got negative
permittivity

173
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:29,100
a so yes I mean

174
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:36,100
thats its

175
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:42,248
his their bus yes
