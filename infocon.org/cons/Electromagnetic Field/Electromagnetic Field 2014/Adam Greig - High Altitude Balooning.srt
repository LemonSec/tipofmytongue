1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,090
lol hello I got your attention

2
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:18,259
right K and still well where eight
minutes behind schedule so

3
00:00:18,259 --> 00:00:24,240
as i sat next two minutes we should be
fine you can see any be slight say gas

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,168
say I'm going to do my absolute best to
rate them amusingly

5
00:00:27,169 --> 00:00:30,989
summertime hopefully have video which
will have allowed basie sounds so you'll

6
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:33,290
be able to hear that and just imagine
the rest a bit

7
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:36,589
I'm right filled so

8
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:39,950
hi everyone thank you for coming to this
talk I'm broadly talking about

9
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,190
high-altitude balloons

10
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,099
and this is really beautiful fight on
the screen that we took him on a

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,260
housekeeper loans

12
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,449
it's about 35 kilometers above the
surface of the earth

13
00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,928
and you can save this curvature it's
really pretty there's a gentle

14
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:55,190
transition from the a this fic real
atmosphere

15
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:58,820
outs but lack of space and by the edge
with photos just black in that space

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,499
i misses this classic photo that we got
almost off lights and

17
00:01:02,499 --> 00:01:08,370
you here you can see any of its a just
close your eyes and dream if nasa

18
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,890
satellite photos that I often

19
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:14,780
you got the test okay great say outline
the first talk for some handy bullet

20
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,320
points

21
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,410
and I'm going to start off with some
stuff is in Houston ballooning

22
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:22,420
but is fast exciting rockets but almost
as high altitude

23
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,920
because that gets the best videos and
then dig into how to clean itself

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,160
there's a brief overview what is high up
steep learning and why do we do it earns

25
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:35,600
how does it work and then a little bit
to chat about the electronic stability

26
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,449
amis payload systems which made

27
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:40,650
some talk about the software systems
we've got this really great community

28
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,690
where lots of people can get involved
and

29
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:46,620
feel like that fully participating while
sitting home in the ham radio shock so

30
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:50,820
that's exciting than a kind of history
trip through some exciting launches

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,910
we've had in the past and more recently

32
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,310
and my guess is that the future actually
gave us talk two years ago

33
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:00,890
up an osteopath and had this great slide
if things that might happen in the next

34
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,280
two years and they all happened

35
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,640
cycles new ideas this time it was a hot
guys and then some great details on how

36
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:07,790
you can get involved yourself

37
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:11,280
and finally details perhaps deeply
launch will be doing

38
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,170
at EMS hopefully and

39
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,280
I K this is the slide with a photo of me
and some details

40
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,770
I'm Adam black I'm an engineering
student and for the last year's

41
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:24,440
I've been a member of Cambridge
University spaceflight which is a

42
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:25,510
student society

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:29,579
we do have she balloons and rockets some
other things the kind of it

44
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,920
excite us and I'm also

45
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,339
nominally a member of something called
the UK high-altitude society

46
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,730
which is a very loose collective people
who were interested in me is

47
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:44,160
ballooning self and kinda come together
to work on

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,780
and I interesting balloon stuff yeah

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:53,970
and okay on my fate the videos i'd
dennis is going to play a lot because

50
00:02:53,970 --> 00:03:00,970
exported and PowerPoint in the car on
the way here

51
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:16,010
there's no sound and you can see the
video so I just get bypass this

52
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:22,000
I am nevermind I have steep learning a
cave is another beautiful photo

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,600
you can I can just see the outline a BF
but you probably can

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,380
I am on to be above you have siblings

55
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:32,910
these really big balloons usually made
all latex

56
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:35,079
about some people have been
experimenting with different areas more

57
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:37,320
recently and spare

58
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,130
actually manufactured for metrological
majors on planes these are the things

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,670
the Met Office launchers twice a day
from 10 places across the country

60
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,070
and they go up in a pot when they come
down on the Met Office

61
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:51,230
looks at where they went on the way up
to work out why the winds are blowing

62
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:55,190
and battle protects the lever we fill
them with helium

63
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:58,550
or sometimes hydrogen which is more
flammable Burton cheaper

64
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:03,760
and attach I'm payload see them and
usually the payloads are doing a similar

65
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,739
kind of think he's met of its planes
they

66
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,960
have a GPS unit on them and most EPS is
work just fine

67
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,320
that kind of attitude they get their
position and relay it down

68
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:16,149
over radio and a few options for the
radio system I'll talk about those in a

69
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:16,500
bit

70
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:20,250
than on the counter see via paydays
hopefully

71
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,470
figure how it's going to come down and
go pick it up maybe put some cameras on

72
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,310
the payload you got your beautiful
photos

73
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:30,080
I'm has really that passive learning
thing in a nutshell

74
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,840
a lot of people are into it because they
like photos some people like making a

75
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,000
custom electronics was a lot of scope
for doing

76
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,240
interesting exciting things on the
electronics I'm

77
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,730
and then right they things come down
from 80 someone such a CB signals

78
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,420
usually receive greater signals yourself
but because the

79
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,140
protocol is open anyone across the
country all across the world

80
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:55,510
and pick them up they've got a good
radio and antenna and people do

81
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:58,190
so we built this whole system where
anyone who wants to can download the

82
00:04:58,190 --> 00:04:58,770
software

83
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,010
licence fees rated listen to these
planes and

84
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:06,659
the potluck my they are and has some pay
sites for photos about save it a

85
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,250
so I am our

86
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,980
this is where having my speaking out
some ice cream would have been fantastic

87
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:16,520
re

88
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,190
I have to talk about electronics fast

89
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:21,250
a classic kinda payload is an Arduino

90
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,700
a GPS unit misfits TPS et tout
adversarial

91
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,690
if you have used the GPS you know
exactly what that looks like and

92
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,020
formats the message slightly sends it
back over the radio major modules marry

93
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,669
you can buy

94
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:36,970
thing off a shelf at you stick in charge
we know and needs nothing else it just

95
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,960
chat to it by talking up in high and low

96
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,440
on your job is done all the way through
to building to a joint on your cell from

97
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,030
scratch for PLL since a huge

98
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:49,109
often does not like the first time and
on the screen are some pretty photos

99
00:05:49,110 --> 00:05:53,140
various electronics people have made
okay

100
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,870
and the major telemetry the people you
know about radio

101
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,010
we use usually something called RTTY
which is where you have these two

102
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:02,320
frequencies is kinda frequency
modulation

103
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,840
and use it some binary data Sofia on
frequency about zero

104
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,599
and at the upper frequency that Swan and
you just send out so you later

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:12,860
it sounds kind primitive it is it
predates pretty much every other form

106
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:16,340
technology this is the stuff people you
stop with the actual mechanical teletype

107
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,679
printers over the radio

108
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:21,040
but it works well enough for us and

109
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,040
how well as well enough Sobeys payloads
are transmitting left Emily what's up

110
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,500
our

111
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,610
which is about as much as your cocky
fault or not your car

112
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:31,940
the balloons are something like thirty
kilometers are

113
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:37,050
and say 500 kilometers away from you and
we still that's lemon tree just great

114
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:41,290
so it's like five six hundred kilometers
distance same power is your cocky fall

115
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:44,350
and you pick up a slim in shape the
secret as it's really

116
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:48,050
really slow it's like 50 bought data so
you're saying that you can see each

117
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:49,060
character come in

118
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:52,850
slower than you could type it it's awful
and

119
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:55,970
on the screen now is a map a system we
felt

120
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:57,890
I

121
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,060
I I can see it kind of there's a map at
the UK

122
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,060
and you can see visible radio masts were
everyone who's running the software SM

123
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,740
power has Sharma they are and they're
picking up signals means planes

124
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:14,400
yet

125
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,609
who that's right on see the more
interesting parts

126
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:21,990
as you can see much besides and we
launched a cuddly dinosaur into space

127
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,950
was a fighter cuddly dinosaur in space

128
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:27,800
we want some teddy bears into space and
this

129
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,970
was quite good family went to a local
primary school had a big outreach event

130
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:34,650
got two different classes heads to build
space suits that teddy bears so they

131
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:36,070
could keep him warm up in space

132
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:39,120
the kids got to learn about insulation
building star

133
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:42,820
I got papercraft a base that's names on
the teddy bears little flags

134
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:46,909
they look really speak right I'm you
probably

135
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:53,910
I did I cannot see anything on the
screen I mean I really

136
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,420
I right I am

137
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:04,000
I'm life to touch it it's kinda they can
have a anyway

138
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,700
the other he said he buys and we've got
famous I miss couples

139
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,810
temperature sensors deep inside the
teddy bears and set them up in space

140
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:14,180
and the kids are all excited waiting to
see how warm teddy bear staying out a

141
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,400
grounder maybe 12 13 degrees say a

142
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,799
healthy body temperature for teddy bear
by the time they got in space though

143
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,060
down at -40

144
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:29,060
say when they didn't survive a trip but
it's like a the kids on a lot

145
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,439
and there's a

146
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,710
fate of some really rusty electronics
now often you don't get these things

147
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,840
back especially in the early days of the

148
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,710
hobby happen people didn't really know
what they were doing may have much less

149
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,120
sophisticated tools for

150
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,350
predicting that the blue might go I'm it
was kind of a potluck you launch a fag

151
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,620
and it comes down somewhere new

152
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:52,010
really hope for the best summer easy to
get to in this case that landed him in

153
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,930
of say and we thought that was the end
of it

154
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:57,530
24 months later it's washed up on the
coast somewhere covered in rust

155
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,610
someone's found at walking a dog on the
beach give gave us a phone call

156
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,720
and put the st. cut out everything was
beautiful so what the photos

157
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,180
no trouble and

158
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,209
yet kill and

159
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,420
more exciting than just sending up
cameras and getting photos

160
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:17,180
one if a project community space later
to be such a clearance was

161
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:21,319
a collaboration with the European Space
Agency so your space agency and you're

162
00:09:21,319 --> 00:09:21,810
looking so

163
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,399
land things on mars which you do because
Moses great

164
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:30,819
idly parachutes shell of a very very
scary couple of minutes between all bet

165
00:09:30,819 --> 00:09:31,670
on on the ground

166
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:35,479
and is your parachute stonework you will
be on the ground in more places than one

167
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:40,329
and you'll be have a sad day so to you
need to do is pass it right

168
00:09:40,329 --> 00:09:44,079
problem is in March the atmospheres
relief endured the orbiting see it on

169
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:44,969
the supersonic

170
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:49,149
supersonic parachute soho little black
magic if you want to test two parachutes

171
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:52,790
and the right conditions to even eat a
huge wind tunnel at which there is one

172
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:54,779
in the world and it is very expensive

173
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:59,079
or you try and be a bit cleverer which
is what we tried to do here

174
00:09:59,079 --> 00:10:02,930
say if areas Martian atmosphere is quite
fen and

175
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:05,930
of atmosphere is quite fen at twenty
kilometers altitude

176
00:10:05,930 --> 00:10:10,500
so you take your parachute up to 25
kilometers or so and really set

177
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,649
that it falls down until it set its
terminal velocity which in this case is

178
00:10:13,649 --> 00:10:14,380
supersonic

179
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:17,399
and then really really hope the
parachute deploys because %uh voice

180
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:21,189
representing the first 12 kilograms
supersonic lumper fiberglass a massless

181
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:22,670
can have such a bad day

182
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,300
and this will go straight for an engine
block

183
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:31,170
Sohae like level at very very careful
planning you go to to make sure this

184
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:34,329
thing has like is but since three parts
each part street from how should seize

185
00:10:34,329 --> 00:10:37,290
power she has two different pieces
electronic switch confi the parachute

186
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,630
so we've really really sure the
parachute to work so

187
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:44,060
yep we take this thing up to 25
kilometers let it go it accelerates

188
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,430
until it's going really fast

189
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,870
how she comes out we collect loads of
great great day to the European Space

190
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,069
Agency gives us tons

191
00:10:50,069 --> 00:10:54,829
money everyone is very happy and miss
some pretty diagrams we made

192
00:10:54,829 --> 00:10:59,109
on how it would work but you can see
them there's a great bday we paid

193
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:02,250
someone to take it up in a helicopter to
test it at a low altitude

194
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:06,959
just make sure the parachutes deployed
and that you don't have some hunt or

195
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:07,420
video

196
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,329
so if you imagine helicopter kinda
hovering

197
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:13,460
a hundred meters above the ground and
suddenly is quite large

198
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:17,630
RNs fiberglass contraption looks a lot
like missile quite Bob Vokey

199
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:21,170
but it's pointing down which is the
wrong way and I'm

200
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:24,849
suddenly it drops it starts falling was
an intake of breath from at whoever is

201
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,690
holding the camera

202
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:29,210
dutiful parachute on files and some
ghosts

203
00:11:29,210 --> 00:11:33,339
and and has a gun gently say that
somebody a person

204
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:37,810
still photos of it that you or say can
you can maybe see a kindness SOC 80 inch

205
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:38,540
plan

206
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,540
yeah this is under the Pasha it's great
and

207
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,550
okay and then we eventually that the
real test in space and missus

208
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:49,979
of other great video has partially been
deployed in space

209
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,890
and

210
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:58,130
the and mind we sent an amtrak train
into space a lot people been playing

211
00:11:58,130 --> 00:11:58,500
with

212
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:01,970
easier electronics if you don't really
feel like programming unfailing or sold

213
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:02,950
ring up not reno

214
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,890
perhaps so you can light up for your
phone phones have GPS phones have

215
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:10,630
cameras phones even happen majors bill
ten-second just text me where it says

216
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,040
iron it works quite well I was fun

217
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:19,390
and more recently people have been doing
some exciting things and

218
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,319
traditionally reached cents positions
back down over the radio and you had to

219
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,310
go and find a payload and really hope it
survives and so forth

220
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,040
to get the MEM the photos of memory card
so

221
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,550
obviously why not send the photos down
over the radio sounds great but

222
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:37,209
300 bought it's still several minutes
for a tiny tiny from now

223
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:40,530
people be working on my slowly I went
out the point where you got

224
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:44,589
kinda good images the slight I deny to
take a stupid let shot 10 really because

225
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:46,750
this is all the photos are spaced
corrupted by

226
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,180
radio noise I'm you yet

227
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:53,390
it's a not a beautiful photo of the
Earth's atmosphere and the gentle curve

228
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:54,760
it should be up against the backdrop

229
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,450
space this one transmitted live from
wannabes hatchlings

230
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:01,860
I'm and then finally the other really
obvious thing

231
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:05,320
to talk about in terms of exciting
happen lights and

232
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:10,110
sometime between lastima and the CMF
some good Leo partners decided %uh this

233
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,160
looks like a fun hobby

234
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,709
and I'm in the last night and I year

235
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:18,680
has launched something like seventy
balloons so he's a fine display letting

236
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:19,609
down to a fine art

237
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:23,480
I mean seventies Ahmad lotteries planes
and

238
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,360
the public on C have it looks like a
really cool tiny satellite it's got

239
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,440
little solar panels

240
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,960
it's about the size of a stick of gum it
weighs 11 grams and I'm

241
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:35,750
goes up on a plane his very first fight
kinda

242
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:39,160
launched from wherever he leads and came
down a few miles away and it was

243
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,339
by all accounts fairly pedestrian the
next flight just out into the North Sea

244
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,810
which is not uncommon

245
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:48,750
the next light hit Ron switch happens on
a very bad day

246
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:53,900
and many people started to pay attention
the next fight when even five in turn

247
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,510
off safe

248
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:58,170
when our to flight 10 and its drifted
over frantz

249
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:01,640
into germany are down past the few a Nia

250
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,880
almost hit Ukraine and landed in Turkey

251
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:09,290
which is a bit more exciting a continued
flying launching a couple every day for

252
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:09,990
a long while

253
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:13,080
this one goes into germany are past

254
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,750
the and I parts of Scandinavia

255
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:22,930
and ends up landing a new crime the next
one goes even farther past and in turn

256
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:23,729
ons in Russia

257
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:29,720
well up to flight number forty and it's
gone past the Arctic Circle

258
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,000
flight forty four lands in Syria 45 and
you really starting to see where he's

259
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,839
going for here

260
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:40,770
drifts all the way past North Africa and
ends up landing at the corner this map

261
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,000
but maybe you can say

262
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,810
I'm and south across a pasta gonna some
like 47 and

263
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,640
last heard from just over Japan at this
point no one really knows where it

264
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:56,959
landed but it probably had a sad time in
the state flight 52

265
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,630
and we've done a big circle all around
southern Europe past Turkey and back

266
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:02,610
again into UK

267
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,830
we spoke people starting think what is
his secret and it turns out the secret

268
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:08,320
in this case is trying forty

269
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,640
by 52 times it works great it turns out
maps and down to a fine art

270
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,910
he's payloads are every bit as perfect
emphasizes the need to be they weigh as

271
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:17,969
little as possible

272
00:15:17,970 --> 00:15:22,330
the solar panels mean they can go on for
as long as they need to go on and

273
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,410
the balloon start getting more and more
special

274
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,980
now on supply I've

275
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:33,160
well yeah I K i'm suppose I'm miss been
effing running for a few years for

276
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,079
people like what big

277
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,040
really great really really great if you
get a balloon all the way across the

278
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,870
Atlantic Ocean

279
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:41,110
because it's a really long distance and
transatlantic has always been this big

280
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:44,000
thing in aviation icons always wanted to
be a trans-atlantic

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,330
and for a long time people which I am a
try and come up with such fantastically

282
00:15:48,330 --> 00:15:50,380
complicated systems you have these
balloons

283
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,529
with lotta mechanical contraptions and
valves and satellite modems and all

284
00:15:54,529 --> 00:15:55,029
sorts

285
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:59,029
and they caps not working and capping
very upsetting

286
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,950
really difficult from UK because the jet
stream always place you

287
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:06,630
eastern side West so you pretty much
have to launch from America or got

288
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,209
really lucky

289
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,029
and that was the status quo and still
summed up in California launched a box

290
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,140
and a balloon and by Trey chance they
went all the way and Mediterranean an ad

291
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,850
on site while let's pick had about that
I'm

292
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:21,110
so Adams kinda hoping maybe wannabes
going to try to cross the Atlantic

293
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:24,380
and eventually one dead the long way say

294
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:29,339
in fact this plane was launched when all
the way out over Russia over Alaska all

295
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:30,839
across continental america

296
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:34,180
then did the transatlantic before
finally coming back to what was launched

297
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:34,520
from

298
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,490
and has since done the same thing again
so it's not circumnavigated the globe

299
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:39,640
twice

300
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:42,990
that so over like 30 days and obviously
he's not going to stand still are not

301
00:16:42,990 --> 00:16:44,730
launch anything to 30 days

302
00:16:44,730 --> 00:16:48,780
so a day after this on those of another
one is launched and it's done the same

303
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,339
thing except this one has the site at
one site navigation is great but what

304
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,890
would be really fun is skipping directly
across North Pole

305
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:58,160
so in fact comes within 10 kilometers to
the north pole going straight up and

306
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,170
down the other side to be a

307
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:02,170
and and is that

308
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,760
is a top-down view that you probably
company make out but it is in fact going

309
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,829
all the way around which is right

310
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:09,800
and then there was a third one of course
and the third one is also gone on the

311
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,389
advice

312
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:14,710
so he's kinda blown over a close out the
water these things are still in the ad

313
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:15,690
still transmitting

314
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:20,560
I am maybe one with a favor MF why we're
here in any event I keep going around

315
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:23,569
when they come over you can pick me up
innocently them in a checked on them

316
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,189
anyway

317
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:28,480
I think it's like 35-40 days a
continuous flight now

318
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:33,940
I'm which is crazy and then there's no
end in sight

319
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:37,740
say those have been some very exciting
launches and

320
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:40,750
there's another map BAW love them to

321
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:44,580
so last time I said are what might
happen what are people gonna do in the

322
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:46,510
future wanna interesting directions to
go in

323
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:50,129
and there are things like maybe people
should start using these radios for

324
00:17:50,130 --> 00:17:52,850
stuff like actual photos and be put on
that which is great

325
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:57,649
and does decide if the speaker launches
when set up taking a huge state explain

326
00:17:57,650 --> 00:17:58,300
you take a

327
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:01,520
very small kinda foil balloon or PASOK
balloon

328
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,320
and he could be nice about impact all
these long-duration flights have been me

329
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,149
special planes makes my hands now

330
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,820
I made out to the same plastic but you
get in like my food containers the kinda

331
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:12,960
peel back stuff it turns out that works
really

332
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,470
a treat for these balloons I am
long-duration floats and funny I was

333
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:19,930
like I have maybe someone will find you
do transatlantic

334
00:18:19,930 --> 00:18:24,230
and that's happened so exciting things
to play with in the future now

335
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,370
special order to get into things and
kinda push the boundary little

336
00:18:28,370 --> 00:18:32,090
and thirties new radios the Laura radios

337
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,659
which Apple to now attraction they're
actually really fast they are very smart

338
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,320
spectrum probably work a lot better

339
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,550
and everything with you so far plus
about five pounds on eBay which is a

340
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:41,540
quarter of the price

341
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:45,500
and you don't need an expensive and
check to see from so probably that will

342
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,430
become really popular

343
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:50,720
and turbo have which is maps

344
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:54,710
in the corner over here invented and say
majors as before the latch lower

345
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,970
correction and it's kind of nice in
binary and

346
00:18:56,970 --> 00:19:00,440
efficient and if you're an engineer
kinda pleases you because the old format

347
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,860
was about as an efficient as you could
get if you try to menu for matters

348
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:07,279
about as efficient as you can get to be
tried on

349
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,860
on the other side spectrum pie in the
sky is this new projects he probably

350
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,809
will hide across the pie which is this

351
00:19:12,809 --> 00:19:17,139
small cheap computer pie in the sky as a
finger sticks on to it and turns it into

352
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:17,919
a happy note

353
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,779
site now all you need to do is buy thing
and stick it on and you have a computer

354
00:19:21,779 --> 00:19:25,419
on a balloon and you can do terrible
things with that computer

355
00:19:25,419 --> 00:19:28,820
maybe and then

356
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:32,668
finally there's this new networking I J
coming about which we're playing with

357
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:33,740
him at impact good

358
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:37,770
UK has snatched which is why we say in
several ways people manually tuning

359
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:40,740
radios and placement balloons and trying
to get a touchdown

360
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,600
went to be great it was all automatic
you have a thing in your garden and a

361
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,668
contract offer things all over the house

362
00:19:46,669 --> 00:19:49,840
and people nearby and a blue incomes
I've had it just chance to it

363
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,490
automatically and they relay messages
and maybe the blue nets your house

364
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,630
network connect with your friends house
network on the other side of the country

365
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,350
and all the while it's connected to the
Internet nedelman see where all the

366
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:00,020
balloons are

367
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:03,179
and it's starting to happen and it looks
like it will actually work which is

368
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:03,770
really cool

369
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:07,850
so when yeah people are playing with his
radio show TNF

370
00:20:07,850 --> 00:20:11,199
someone elsewhere in england might be
trying to launch a balloon to go over

371
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:11,840
our sons

372
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,149
see if the whole talking to everything
automatically will work which would be

373
00:20:15,149 --> 00:20:15,539
great

374
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:19,730
and great so to get involved slight if
you too

375
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:22,880
want your own pretty photos above but
you can see on this project

376
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:27,539
but I show here beautiful and it's very
easy to get involved

377
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,629
boers a friendly UK house UK
high-altitude society

378
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:34,350
there's a great IRC channel called Hot
Shot altitude on freenode

379
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,689
there's a website which has everything
you need to know

380
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:41,029
and is UK HIAS .org.uk

381
00:20:41,029 --> 00:20:45,169
I'm and its on the screen you can see it
and

382
00:20:45,169 --> 00:20:49,059
so yeah and there's a great work a estar
later examples

383
00:20:49,059 --> 00:20:52,309
it's good fun and more excitingly
launching from EMF

384
00:20:52,309 --> 00:20:57,000
and time is to be confirmed because I
only arrives

385
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,299
half an hour ago location is helpful

386
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:05,139
which I don't know where that is because
I have come straight to the stands

387
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,630
right down the far corner pani is that
near a2

388
00:21:07,630 --> 00:21:11,250
it's Nate a and

389
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:15,650
and say this time two years ago we did
the same thing we had this 100 come

390
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,560
latex balloon we bought two of them at
the time

391
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:21,080
it's about this big doesn't make very
much you fill it with helium

392
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,590
I attached a payload could show a which
was this fun little experimental thing

393
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:25,540
with just made

394
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:30,320
and let go way duct taped it into a
jiffy bad but I just written on it in a

395
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,200
stamp them said if found please return

396
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:35,920
as we figured we're not gonna got
chasing it now and up Atlanta and we'll

397
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,120
have some fun we tracked it

398
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:40,149
and then somehow they duct tape failed

399
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:44,750
the payload fell out if it if he died
and hit something like 60 meters a

400
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,340
second

401
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:48,889
which a is an editor today 150 miles an
hour

402
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:52,850
going down and then crashed and in
central London

403
00:21:52,850 --> 00:21:58,449
Sohae a successful fight Scopus wasn't
the best

404
00:21:58,450 --> 00:22:02,900
and we got a lot of really angry emails
my favorite was the one calling out for

405
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:06,330
me to be banned from all future uses
have disputed tracking system

406
00:22:06,330 --> 00:22:09,379
which I felt was a bit harsh given as I
go

407
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:14,250
of it I am anyway we doing exactly the
same thing this time

408
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:19,370
we've got the we've got a new batch of
Joey's none ima be made since a

409
00:22:19,370 --> 00:22:22,949
catastrophe two years ago by founder PC
based so he sewed up six more

410
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:26,550
we've got between 100 grand alone it's
the same one as the two we've got two

411
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,120
years ago

412
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:31,139
has been kept in a bag and a sense is
probably fine and I'm

413
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:35,300
yet twice as much duct tape is pretty
much a plan

414
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:38,889
maybe we'll put a parachute on it I
don't know if we have any power she

415
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,620
no negotiates so twice as much to type

416
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:44,780
and this

417
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:48,210
this one told I should mention which is
this project we have and it uses this

418
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:51,570
high-altitude wind data to protect me a
PM will go and it's great

419
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,409
if you know some properties like it will
Busters attitude that you know well come

420
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:55,840
down

421
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,149
ands you can avoid central London you
can avoid airports you can avoid

422
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:00,410
military bases

423
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:03,490
you can avoid all the things we've had
in the past and had really orkut phone

424
00:23:03,490 --> 00:23:04,200
calls about

425
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,990
I'm I'm you subjected to years ago on a
sec you'll be fine

426
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:11,320
and then the balloon kept on going twice
as high as we expected and central

427
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:11,740
London

428
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:14,940
and say this time me detaining really

429
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,400
it will probably be get on so world
public good on schedule

430
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,830
girl sent out an email to the schedule
people I suppose come known to happen

431
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:23,330
age will launch was playin

432
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:26,820
it will be quite fun going up Alex
Michael will track it on our radios and

433
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:27,659
see where it says

434
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:31,730
I'm cross our fingers but ansohn a
failed and I am

435
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:34,929
nap great thank you very much for
listening

436
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:41,929
that's it

437
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:50,120
and we have time for questions if anyone
has kayak 85 questions great yep

438
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:57,120
site only have my phone for people
questions that's great

439
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:05,000
on people per the slightest normal
schedule for the poor

440
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,960
can look at them offline yes good idea
of a slight up

441
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:13,920
and then you can see the photos yourself
at week 8 okay and when is to blame

442
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,510
going up I don't know when okay

443
00:24:17,510 --> 00:24:21,590
I'll put on the schedule ok for up to
two have any ideas when

444
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:28,590
it's looking like Sunday about me

445
00:24:30,210 --> 00:24:34,110
so how much that costs a sovereign
rights we want your own balloons

446
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,300
but wants or entry-level from I am

447
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,649
like a couple hundred pounds gets you
everything you need to get a plane in

448
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:42,510
the island's track it and so forth

449
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:47,530
and possibly cheaper these days if you
go to a much smaller balloons and very

450
00:24:47,530 --> 00:24:48,420
small payloads

451
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:53,300
but like it be safer than a few hundred
pounds and anger it's like Hamas and

452
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,250
humans able

453
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:59,340
just curious what's the

454
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,919
do you have see mission applying yet

455
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:08,030
I should probably mention that and say
this and the commission is the

456
00:25:08,030 --> 00:25:12,580
it's twofold he if you want to launch a
big plane you have to ask a CAA

457
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:16,110
and I take a little bit of chasing and
it's usually about mom and you can say

458
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:17,500
would like to launch

459
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:21,110
a this day and maybe this day and they
say okay but as long as it doesn't go to

460
00:25:21,110 --> 00:25:21,928
know this applet

461
00:25:21,929 --> 00:25:25,710
and you have to push back for the launch
of ways it is illegal and your bad

462
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,170
person

463
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:31,260
if your plan is quite small less than
two meters and total in closing diameter

464
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:34,000
for the duration of the flight when you
don't need any commission a toll on you

465
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,790
can just let it go

466
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:37,530
which is what we'll be doing these
planes because it's much easier however

467
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:40,580
we have in fact secured permission for
large flew in from this site

468
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,540
over the weekend but I don't know we
have any large balloons to launch

469
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:48,540
I we do so we might be launching smudge
means as well has one other detail which

470
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:48,820
is

471
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:52,220
if you're I hope yes and he just want to
launch a balloon and demonstrate that

472
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:52,980
went mission

473
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,679
there are two sites around the country
by Feng temperature

474
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,179
where we have this kind of rolling 24/7
mission along

475
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:04,140
so people want to lock up we can usually
arranged to that launch a balloon

476
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:11,140
without needing technician to

477
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,350
what does the guy who did

478
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:19,100
the am what's called the not the seventy
launches what the used tracking

479
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:23,730
say he used a combination of things
we've got clever and clever as time goes

480
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:24,120
by

481
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,590
primarily there's the built-in system
which we use over the UK

482
00:26:27,590 --> 00:26:31,899
and that looks great in UK and a normal
people running about software in Europe

483
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,170
in a couple in america and it works
quite well

484
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:37,560
but for most of the world's people are
going to be running the software

485
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,919
or listen up your Bling soap is a
different thing called APRs

486
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:44,280
they damage a packet major system which
if you're an amateur radio operator you

487
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,060
know about

488
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:49,690
and you can use it in the UK it would be
illegal because we're not allowed to use

489
00:26:49,690 --> 00:26:51,090
of how much major licenses

490
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:55,800
upon but if you are outside the UK and
you don't look too closely at the fine

491
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:59,550
print on this article I sent you can
probably maybe use a license app on

492
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:04,070
and so he's been doing that and
occasionally LA Times

493
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,240
wine him on Twitter and he ignores them
say

494
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,330
I'm like the ways around it you can get
say

495
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:14,120
I have a extra American license now
because I'm launching a rocket the radio

496
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:14,729
in america

497
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:19,070
and then I can use that and let's not be
UK and also that's me a free app on

498
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:23,310
a plea but I am yeah APRs works really
well for this money thing

499
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:29,740
if you're not use it so the balloons
which have been so the

500
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:34,039
gone all the way around the earth yet
how long

501
00:27:34,039 --> 00:27:37,980
will it take them to just deflate
entirely it's a really good question and

502
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:38,860
ans quite sure

503
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:42,449
and the fear escalator which leaking
helium is

504
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:46,809
really does because this plastic film is
very impanel and so far they haven't

505
00:27:46,809 --> 00:27:49,918
changed attitude which you'd expect him
to do if they were leaking helium

506
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:55,240
and so its it seems like more likely be
UV degradation will cause a plastic to

507
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:55,679
weaken

508
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,850
and then the possible just pop because
he went up to take pressure but

509
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:04,590
an official yet how much

510
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:07,840
protection against the cold and other
environmental factors that that is the

511
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,519
heartland

512
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,549
am this is having a lot of people kinda
chip up on

513
00:28:12,549 --> 00:28:15,289
I've seen so many times you get you know
the kind of how to handle on things

514
00:28:15,289 --> 00:28:16,879
little sachets but many loves

515
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,600
it and one people to oh it's very cold
about my life trying to get cold

516
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,158
wannabes n to problems they need oxygen
to work

517
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:28,159
which you don't have and certainly is
actually so did laugh at the electronics

518
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:29,100
can keep cool

519
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,340
and you don't get convection cooling I'm
electronics are generating heat

520
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,480
so you sleep and %uh quite warm by
themselves just because they can't go

521
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:35,870
down

522
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:39,750
and so most people fly fairly expose
payloads and it works just great

523
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:43,870
people will tell you but my POS don't
work at -20 and maybe they're right but

524
00:28:43,870 --> 00:28:45,219
looks like a Nazi right

525
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:52,220
its they were just right said

526
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:55,870
honestly kurds leakage rate change
between

527
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,870
human touch so

528
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:03,590
to I'm not entirely qualified to answer
you think maybe okay hydrogen is a much

529
00:29:03,590 --> 00:29:06,779
smaller molecules and helium because
it's only got monetary Dobbins is at

530
00:29:06,779 --> 00:29:07,490
four carbons

531
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:10,940
but actually hydrogen exist size h2 so
it's much bigger

532
00:29:10,940 --> 00:29:14,690
soon pack helium leaks much better basic
is the short answer

533
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:19,440
and can tell us a bit now the guy that's
doing the rounds worldly

534
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:22,860
I mean said anyways 13 grounds and
you're comparing

535
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:26,479
things with most people is things lot
has he built on

536
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:31,320
cell using something national I'm Yahoo
so he's built it himself

537
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,820
peace and I think it would be fair to
dislike him somewhat media-shy his

538
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,158
website is a little sparse

539
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,059
and an the occasion he whines about
people trying to talk to him on this

540
00:29:40,059 --> 00:29:44,049
other IRC channels he's built or
electronics himself which is a fairly

541
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:45,080
normal thing to do

542
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,230
antes worked on getting it as light as
he reasonably calm

543
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,720
so it's a very small PCB it's got a few
small steps not components and nothing

544
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,679
unnecessary I'm he does this for his day
job as well he assembles

545
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,289
I collect running systems and things
fall at one cars and things

546
00:30:01,289 --> 00:30:04,640
I don't know very many details about is
your day job but he knows his

547
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,860
electronics inside out

548
00:30:05,860 --> 00:30:09,270
side yeah he's got himself and

549
00:30:09,270 --> 00:30:13,299
pretty much she just came and looked at
what everyone else is doing a man ass is

550
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:13,970
nice

551
00:30:13,970 --> 00:30:20,970
the and well the results speak for
themselves I suppose

552
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:31,330
to do you tell us about the predictors
of yep but be happy to

553
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,540
a ham the protector software is this
great left so let's vote online you go

554
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,350
to protect

555
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:39,459
to hop up to all can you can type in May
launching from anoche weather balloon

556
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:39,900
goes

557
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:44,820
ands it does this by downloading a
wholly different data for every point on

558
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,810
the surface of the earth

559
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,210
for every time for the next two weeks
which is a heckuva lot of data

560
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:53,710
and take answers from the American
nowhere weather agency people who run a

561
00:30:53,710 --> 00:30:56,300
big super computer model to work out let
the wind is blowing

562
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:59,960
and then it runs from Tampa integration
efforts to say your balloon is here

563
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:02,950
and we know it's going to send this
ascent rate based on how much he me put

564
00:31:02,950 --> 00:31:03,840
in and so forth

565
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:07,409
and it will burst at this altitude
because that's when the plane gets so

566
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,210
big it pops

567
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,740
and then it would ascend this rate we
hope because that's how thick the

568
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,580
atmosphere is NIS tops how she say

569
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:18,139
and at and it lands and such as: kinda
changed a lot about how people can do

570
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:18,740
ballooning

571
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:22,120
it means you can on Jimmy continue
avoiding at ports and cities

572
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,840
and jet fighters who were training has
really awkward I'm

573
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:29,669
like cutting down the tree was no
problem

574
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:33,040
but the latest CA investigation was and

575
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:36,399
so it's good to lick it seems like two
thousand times a day but people all over

576
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:37,020
the world

577
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:41,720
is a really great photo by public on
saying and everyplace and sequester to

578
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,240
launch on and it's basically a
population density mafia

579
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:48,100
any whether people we've got people
passing these predictions and I'm

580
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:51,209
also the new version protector because
uniting everything from scratch is

581
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,160
always the best idea

582
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:55,270
is being deployed in a couple weeks and
it's even tougher

583
00:31:55,270 --> 00:31:58,710
you can do you and see things like say
I'm going to launch sometime in the next

584
00:31:58,710 --> 00:31:59,450
two weeks

585
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:03,440
show me where all the possible landing
locations are and I'm going to launch

586
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,190
and I can change it. my computer and

587
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:08,890
how much they put in to avoid going in
the sea same also its

588
00:32:08,890 --> 00:32:12,560
in Python and might not pass this possum
see version its it's fantastic it's like

589
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:13,909
too many seconds protection

590
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:17,130
system and

591
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,660
yeah

592
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,170
you know what do you think about
Facebook Google and wifi balloons

593
00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:26,230
think that's realistic yeah I am those a
UK has conference

594
00:32:26,230 --> 00:32:29,980
like two weeks ago and we had one of the
guys is consulting for Google noon give

595
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,150
us to talk about people do

596
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:34,960
and it seems like it's working really
well they've actually happens stay up

597
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:38,970
like a couple months and they're
launching they've got launching down

598
00:32:38,970 --> 00:32:41,570
house so that you've been kicking off
his balloons and it's like I just five

599
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:42,000
mile

600
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:46,400
having our site and a mesh perfectly and
that fight like five say it seems to be

601
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,090
working right

602
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,260
and they claim they can control weather
balloons go by

603
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:55,000
making you up and down which is entirely
believable latter it becomes a feasible

604
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,450
commercial project I'm not show it seems
really expensive

605
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:04,450
that the technology definitely lacks

606
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,780
can you tell us about some the worst
flight where things either exploded cool

607
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:13,600
runnin things or something I A and some
of them

608
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,679
as which ones I quite like this said
that military base but I F efforts

609
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:23,370
and and me came down while they were
doing some helicopter training option X

610
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:24,780
and they were most displeased

611
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:29,030
and it landed a mystery little tray I'm
rely on other things in the tall tree it

612
00:33:29,030 --> 00:33:32,899
and this is gonna die I'll cut off in a
problem I got out like P chainsaw

613
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,090
cut into shape army jeep pulled thing I
dunno trouble

614
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,209
and dance at CIA on to us is this

615
00:33:39,210 --> 00:33:41,830
in big investigation where they're like
you know should we have done something

616
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:44,750
differently a reliable what would have
happened if we get a helicopter with

617
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,600
that have been really bad on say yes

618
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:50,419
and eventually they concluded that
really we were probably doing everything

619
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:51,380
legally and fine

620
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,570
and the guy running the investigation
was like also this looks really cool can

621
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:55,860
I see some other photos ito

622
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:59,100
say that was that was a happy ending

623
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,500
and I'm have any other I think the one
that landed in central London us last

624
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,690
the math is pretty bad at sea and in

625
00:34:05,690 --> 00:34:08,820
and plan in part and time

626
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:13,210
some Richmond Park and we knew someone
who was out walking in Richmond Park

627
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:16,699
afternoons he picked it up sausages
right and

628
00:34:16,699 --> 00:34:22,460
ITR but you can haz one I'm getting it
as a shaking had a commission mention

629
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:22,880
that one

630
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:29,880
that they were children hmm

631
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:42,570
I make sure

632
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:46,920
fatty soft and well Potterton nothing
too bad 01 happen to someone else said

633
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,670
nothing about this and it on a power
line and had to shut down

634
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:52,880
out an entire village for an afternoon
together thing off again clips

635
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:56,160
was a huge chunk on a certain media
companies insurance claim

636
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,779
and happened that must have been really
awful

637
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:03,350
yeah not I think later on and in the
middle of a train track

638
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:07,799
and I can certainly understand but if it
will raise margins numbers on the bridge

639
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,290
is like defend the train companies

640
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:14,890
top trends and Annie's

641
00:35:14,890 --> 00:35:17,690
and suggestions

642
00:35:17,690 --> 00:35:21,350
oh yeah I am we have another from long
glad we came down

643
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:24,450
and look for a very long time I could
land on a major motorway which had been

644
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:25,250
so helpful

645
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:28,950
turns out contact 1 percent at the
surface save England

646
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:32,399
is major votes which means you want two
hundred balloons attack want them to

647
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,630
land on a major road

648
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:37,570
hasn't happened yet has been restricting
straight over major I'd

649
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:40,890
on really really look like a donde name
has assigned a couple then at last

650
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,910
moment they talked to the site and
almost to cut a construction work on top

651
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:49,569
voting mascot is the Vijay scan is still
running tests video swinging by

652
00:35:49,570 --> 00:35:52,970
not by hitting him and the guy who is
only wants this fixed up

653
00:35:52,970 --> 00:35:57,890
we've gotten home the scientific talent
on the site yes harmless my

654
00:35:57,890 --> 00:36:04,890
do last fortunately he then has a strike
not the box doesn't contain the video

655
00:36:05,350 --> 00:36:07,500
cameras and vomiting around for freebies

656
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:12,030
siegel's owners who batteries take the
batteries out realizes a GPS tracker

657
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:17,030
lets it back in the box still has
included the other box is a video shot

658
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:19,980
yes we've got a spectator him and how
much his boss and he's like what I do

659
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,740
best in the bosses liar

660
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:24,740
and their and then analyzes the phone
number

661
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,370
me to make that they should call us they
decide you're probably some stuff up I'm

662
00:36:28,370 --> 00:36:31,790
don't call us I return to the office a
few minutes later and I could be a

663
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:33,500
problem back bases inside your office

664
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:37,500
in so

665
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:41,480
and they tied it at that into a video
compilation on YouTube a week I dot the

666
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,910
i's faces that you can hear the audio
myspace

667
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:48,920
say I think that's probably enough
battle on stories

668
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,800
like maybe if I mean a tonight in the
bar I can tell you that the one about

669
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:57,110
a I am

670
00:36:57,110 --> 00:37:01,430
hella I I'm and I was

671
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:05,460
curious about what he was saying before
about them at if everyone put their

672
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,340
underlings up and then you could share

673
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:11,020
your connection with other people line
and connect to you

674
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,890
yeahh I know I can tell us how that
world to me could you expand on

675
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:18,779
a medal shot say the basic idea its
first UK house got snacks as the thing

676
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:19,910
that's been set up for it

677
00:37:19,910 --> 00:37:23,910
and young these major modules our fans

678
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,100
be levels in part number: and I'm they

679
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,600
automatically for mankind network by
anyone and transmits anyone else for his

680
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:31,460
it receives it

681
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:35,300
and we have a simple practical lets them
repeat anything they hear so that is

682
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:36,540
going to be two stations

683
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:40,540
those aids time to life in the pocket
can't live with host

684
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:44,410
so packets and yet he did so many times
and then the Bruins just another note

685
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:47,609
and the idea is to have one in your
garden that sends back locks temperature

686
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:51,370
or humidity or something going and have
one in your house this

687
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:55,109
up in Japan Beach Rd st. and that's not
to get anything at this eve set up to

688
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:55,720
the internet

689
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:58,910
an Indian style has a map and you can
see everything and even perceived

690
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:02,609
and the really key idea is to bring this
overhead should have lines site

691
00:38:02,610 --> 00:38:06,430
with your network on the ground in some
help on the ground and could relate back

692
00:38:06,430 --> 00:38:07,169
its between them

693
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:10,400
unlike place I feel for balloons they
could all see each other and send

694
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,240
packets between a

695
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:14,700
and it's not there how useful it would
be but it'd be really cool

696
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:18,140
and save peoples issuing at and as I
understand it that

697
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:21,609
are or will be several of these notes
around sites here say

698
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:28,610
and maybe that the Dodgers doing that as
well maybe

699
00:38:29,830 --> 00:38:34,170
okay I will question now that's great
because it's now 14:46

700
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,160
sorry I one minute overtime thank you
very much
