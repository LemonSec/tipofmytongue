1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,629
he want now but no further delay I had
like 10 she see you Tom

2
00:00:12,629 --> 00:00:17,610
on a round of applause

3
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:20,910
I've never been introduced by Arthur
story before so it's comical

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,720
I i'm tom and there are i've spent last
year building a spaceship

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,590
in a caravan with a cup three other
people as well and this is a

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,800
solve horrific harrowing story of how we
did it I'm

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,550
so where we are on our way up this
charles is just come running up to the

8
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,890
pharmacy in a second

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:40,330
his response with electronics on the
video system I'll talk about a fucking

10
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:41,290
system's me

11
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:44,559
right pretty much all the software in a
Tim their

12
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,640
who sits in the corner complains that
Soulja

13
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,100
I'm and chris is not here lost

14
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:56,030
my icon Eddie I'm using IE

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:03,030
this claire who's our trusty driver and
bookings assistant and boss

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:08,229
I'm but Chris who you I don't think is
here

17
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:12,060
he did a bunch the prop work for us I
was a bunch of people I'm so too

18
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,940
rust I'm test John C by see anyone on
the tax base images I know it becomes

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:17,869
our test players

20
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:21,360
and we have used them and turf is an
honorary captain

21
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,649
as well a is a lot nicer to people that
we are the only player

22
00:01:25,649 --> 00:01:29,479
I'm so what is its three players story

23
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:34,140
inside caravan a spaceship and the
crease icons for training mission after

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,729
being

25
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:38,830
democrat training I'm a Floyd and the
usual explode

26
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:42,240
what actually is a car bomb for the
vault reno's laptops and several

27
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:44,140
kilometers orange wire that isn't
labeled

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:49,020
I am head is a if anyone hasn't played
yet there will be spoilers

29
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:52,530
in this I will be playing at layer on
all the time so how we gonna saw that on

30
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:52,899
the Mina

31
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:56,860
and say that this could happen because
we were both the

32
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:00,739
hasn't heard about a mess yeah excellent
I'm we are playing now and thought it

33
00:02:00,739 --> 00:02:03,179
does need more explosions an actual prop
somethings

34
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:06,300
as the Foreign Office eating a smoke
machine so I started ripping apart the

35
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,179
network protocol

36
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,009
the developer was in particular how
forward eso opposition far out why shock

37
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:11,988
it turns out he was just

38
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,760
throwing strikes internet web packets is
really somewhat apart

39
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,480
as ira proxy which takes game events and
throw them out over open sound control

40
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,340
so we can triggers my machines and other
displays all kinds of fun things am

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,230
got some way to help site for anyone
does want to have a go building a

42
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,280
spaceship

43
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,840
I wouldn't a.m. the few problems in the
autumn it is kinda hard to play

44
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,720
in about 15 minutes so if we're going to
take this whole thing to other places to

45
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,600
play a trick on train someone spite our

46
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:42,940
because it's basically a SEM so which I
can be thought what a mirroring

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:43,790
simulator

48
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:48,329
how cannot be I am and we thought let's
go we got that done so

49
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:51,890
to welcome installer this week company
in every menu economic a spare room that

50
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,890
we can permit the assigned to the same
God RH

51
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:56,950
at the house by pretty well let's do it
because the roomies to be used for other

52
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:57,579
stuff

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:02,130
as I reject me said hey whatever is a
caravan and it shows what a caravan

54
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,730
I am and it turned up and that was it it
was about two hundred quid and it was a

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,100
help both the body shows held on the
ranch straps because it was a complete

56
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,239
state a point in saying people the

57
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,020
Brainiac get those from so to give you a
clue what it was like

58
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:20,150
I'm so did a debate about that the
design process

59
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,340
which is basically wouldn't it be cool
if

60
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,380
a which usually happen on IRC on the
toilet

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,900
I wandering back from a pub somewhere or
what hitting the crap out inside a van

62
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,590
with Hamas

63
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:34,100
I am and not let on to oh my god yes

64
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:37,299
very rarely did we say that's a bad idea
which is

65
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:41,060
for this stupid we right by CR i7 rice
in code for this

66
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,720
I usual my lunch break at work boy in
the evenings or on the train or

67
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,250
anywhere I have 50 minutes and some what
about a laptop and then we'd also around

68
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,910
just laughing hysterically at the idea
and never come back with more

69
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:55,930
I'm eventually we got a plan

70
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:59,830
which was the players would be
introduced to the ship at bay words

71
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:02,390
launch prepare private space jump
slingshot around mars

72
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:06,769
fighter training area and then return
home a doc the rotating station

73
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:10,540
what actually happens during the mission
houses buried away the slingshot many

74
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,810
the guys totally wrong the ship breaks
after apparent the training air is

75
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:15,470
actually a war zone mid-life targets

76
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:19,339
and the station is rotating I'm is no
talking computer that's not raiders one

77
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,669
now but we don't tell anyone unless
they've been critically about

78
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:24,900
I'm we decided we'd need a kinda pilot

79
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:29,500
Taxco officer and an engineer a that was
the basic idea we had when we start

80
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,100
doing this

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:33,310
I'm the other thing is re: com

82
00:04:33,310 --> 00:04:36,850
write anything with Diana at all on
Obama to learn anything or certain

83
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:40,710
figure out some dude that's the site
which are the games master

84
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:42,820
sat in the back of the van

85
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:45,469
running everything step as it turned out
to be really fun because

86
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,080
if we're doing our day with this its
kinda nice to have

87
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,440
a one person outside training minutes
crew one flying the current chrome one

88
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,660
person the back killing them

89
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,480
because one in the back is actually some
was really nice to sit and have a drink

90
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,430
I am

91
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,290
out you can talk to people is what's
really fun hashers bonus that are

92
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,290
the GM rear is actually will transporter
room and is functioning

93
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,740
I'm so the idea is a eco-system ass a
giveaway

94
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:12,340
a no one knows that we're in the back
room and the transport of works

95
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,030
halfway through the flight and them yeah

96
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:20,400
someone jumps and cozy I'm you can also
we have it we have a video system on

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,020
board as well

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:24,400
so the original plan was to have the
crew

99
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,239
would be flying and will be instructed
over video call how to fly the ship I

100
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,440
see our mission controller

101
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,000
a.m. it turns out for various reasons
that was never going to work

102
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,570
also getting a minute I was I once read
we we kinda

103
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,140
designed it Woodside separating the
actual hard work

104
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,469
which was that was a stay at a caravan
we gotta

105
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:47,630
it was full of crap it was rotting at
the show was falling off

106
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:51,250
there's a lot of bronze bars holding the
the walls up not holding the walls up

107
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:55,850
we smashed all those hours swept out in
size by painting outside waterproof it

108
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:58,460
because it wasn't it still isn't
waterproof actually was a leak about 10

109
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,020
the sates

110
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:04,409
I'm is anyone up late last night we'll
find out 30 south at ninety a black hair

111
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:07,420
them decide where she had to build the
thing inside

112
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:11,890
we found to Chris and I found a huge
chunk of MDF behind a flat nomas

113
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,310
guarding so we I protect my iPhone

114
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,590
people were quite happy they are you
guys doing the spaceship do you want

115
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,190
bits like Erica switches and buttons in
doing so

116
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:25,240
in the top left I'm picture there I'm
the right on consoles cokie port

117
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,300
which is from a police radio control
unit phil has a whole lotta Rosie just

118
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,850
got 21 them like your khmer

119
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,110
they recall at the Joyce exams actually
I E

120
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:36,120
force feedback Microsoft for three bucks
take I'm

121
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,520
it died a.m. and they're really hard to
get working with modern software because

122
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,020
they're

123
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,359
this from such a game Paul so we have to
hack an adopted together

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,250
and that didn't last members about
barging in there so if you're going to

125
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,810
paint everything this yr Chris on the
left on the right hand side assembling

126
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:52,160
the

127
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,630
the a check on so

128
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,180
that was buttons junk the keyboard
makers such a cash register

129
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:02,200
it's no USB cable which is quite fun

130
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,289
I mistook the transporter room door
funny car dashboard in place

131
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,400
I know this but we realize I see I'm
good at the seven right s

132
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,469
I'm cuz rebuilt it's about your now this
is the first version of it which

133
00:07:12,470 --> 00:07:16,440
I think the screenshot 40 was created in
November

134
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,969
your gun brother that's the first time I
ever got unity to actually talk to

135
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:27,360
and Audrina was horrible I regard as the
cable Paso side

136
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,440
recycling all the systems that the ships
can use it's critical writing this

137
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,040
because you realize you're writing a
spaceship

138
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,190
I'm not like a game-high she kind of
putting physical things in and then you

139
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:38,550
look at goats I get all excited

140
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:42,670
why do anyway for you know by the
spaceship I was I gonna react control

141
00:07:42,670 --> 00:07:45,510
panel which is a buncha switches and
lights. sensory discussing about

142
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:47,159
soldering down there press on the cover

143
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,600
and this this is a cut the first time
the game ever ran

144
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:53,800
M-one with all the machine though
although the client skirted

145
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,500
I'm that was on my desk at work during
my lunch break on my coworkers wanna

146
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,270
know how I was doing

147
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:04,620
I write this pressure go away I'm it
basically

148
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,610
it basically worked at that point I'm so
we kinda

149
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:12,840
decided we needed a deadline as you do
and we saw

150
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:16,669
when I make a fast coming up the one in
Newcastle so let's apply for that which

151
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:17,140
we did

152
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,789
and they said yeah cool we panicked a
bit because the basic hunger and have it

153
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,290
working

154
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:27,030
I'm and the night before Maker Faire we

a dashboard install the injured a

156
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,680
console

157
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:34,390
I just about Patriots slice a whole lot
of the top getting some measurements

158
00:08:34,390 --> 00:08:34,819

caravan behind us we were so it's gonna

162
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,400
be safe 10

163
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,540
we got there we got my network cabling
and we have no safe for anyone to say on

164
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,500
so we kinda yea when a bit rubbish but

critic a mid

174
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,180
I was like a family I liked our two kids

175
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,979
basically have a guy like I we gotta say
level where you are literally kept the

176
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,910
first we were ever to actually play

177
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:34,910
I am so things going to cairo mirar
demand a nice

178
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:38,000
its home built that's fair enough so we
start the game up

179
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,280
something what are the norm
catastrophically or catastrophically

180
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,040
dire um

181
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,750
and we have to spend 15 minutes with me
repairing it all summer fixing and then

182
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,570
we got signs I he wants to have another
go

183
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:52,010
and it was a really where testing for
his side during suffer from someone as

184
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:52,280
I'm

185
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:55,520
you know does it work there was three
people sat like I like

186
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,130
this is free shipping yearbook your what
didn't work what do you think was

187
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,760
what do you think was really difficult
what do you think was bad I don't care a

188
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,290
spacious right affects your enthusiasm
for

189
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:08,520
from your head you corey has some of a
bike on that plays

190
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm and as as a kind a safety thing we
had decided to have a captain

191
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:15,480
captain site in the cabin with the
players

192
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,420
side when things pick up from you could
I have a KK Birla Corp like a plan or

193
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,660
kind of gloss over it with storyline and
i ended up working so well we kept doing

194
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:23,910
it

195
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:29,320
a.m. report about to make a fact this is
the point where we decided to add more

196
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:29,990
things

197
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,300
and tied up what we had in stock
trolling miss out to other places

198
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,209
person the phrase recall where did all
the time go because it kind of

199
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:40,580
houses a cigar to a huge list the
problems from Maker Faire

200
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,790
a.m. we finally got useful things out
people seems like the engineer was

201
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:46,240
actually fun at that point the keys are
too small to read you can

202
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,470
actually tap them it was kinda a greater
very tiny rising

203
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,860
and it was really difficult to read them
in the lights are in the Bison USB likes

204
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,100
that didn't really work either

205
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,130
as we are screwed up this crap is to
some house the talking system was and

206
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:01,070
continues to be very difficult to use

207
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:04,970
a.m. I'm working on trying to make that
not publish

208
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,170
at the moment a pilot radars confusing
for

209
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:11,709
problem is I don't know how to read the
write up because I writer I

210
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:15,030
and also known as fatally is generally
okay with it because it's because entire

211
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,350
republic the elite radar system

212
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:20,950
a love this is repre- ripped off from
everything I like about space games

213
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,779
soap scope at the captain Kevin what's
really well not just because the other

214
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,570
problems but also for conover

215
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,330
a message even story a little bit more
people start to build up their own

216
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:30,940
little stories around the game abrahms

217
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,860
of common theme of it so fast I flew in
this how from I

218
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:39,800
rewrite buyers are George is here night
we keep stealing his line about people

219
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:40,550
having their first

220
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:43,550
at this is the first why after five
years a flight school no one just looks

221
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,010
like five years before school

222
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:48,600
we are in the car park with a folded his
account I'm

223
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:53,100
well the puzzles are based on USB cables
being collected in a hurry I'm

224
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:56,190
land that once again I

225
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:00,250
back when that broke a.m. there was a
massive panic by the guy trying to

226
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,190
connect to be broken a USB connectors

227
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,250
but it's hilarious cuz they died I'm

228
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:08,459
so apart from the actual problem this we
have we got beat reliable for love

229
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:09,000
things

230
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,740
there's a section marginal recall right
as the windscreen should crack

231
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:17,029
how bout we got a success screen that
most which is more buttons I what if

232
00:12:17,029 --> 00:12:18,220
things fall off the walls

233
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:21,480
I am going to self-destruct a really bad
players we can't get them out and get

234
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,240
the next crew n

235
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:26,370
to catch a scam I'm coming record
players with cameras can we create a

236
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,620
button you should never push

237
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,330
but yeah because we can sorry we got
such a scammer the projector

238
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:34,180
that was quite nice action is really
from people outside because I can watch

239
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,620
her play at a friends file

240
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:39,310
I'm so the top right there we had more
switches the engineer Council because

241
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,239
if you're running a nuclear reactor you
should sit in front over and go be

242
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,230
really scared because it's a nuclear
reactor

243
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:49,690
I'm up to get up on that you should
never ever push when people take this

244
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:50,120
lovely

245
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:54,250
I self destruct be added for fun and
that's quite nice we decide to Christmas

246
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,550
tree lights because all spacious our
Christmas tree lights I am

247
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:00,689

248
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:04,510
we tend to run I games on Tuesday
night's in the house place where

249
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,060
and you have a time a running on the
dashboard and is a scripted

250
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:11,910
totally scripted thing is no one in the
back trying to kill you I'm and basic

251
00:13:11,910 --> 00:13:13,630
how quickly can you get to the end of
the game

252
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,579
had four minutes 26 as the car record if
two people wanted for

253
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,609
now for 26 this is the most

254
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:25,630
this is only documented one I do it is
my arms flowing so

255
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:29,500
but I will try to be there later because
it is best

256
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,830
but also try beating the record add to
people is a good team

257
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:36,280
10 years bouncing I would have been
doing two jobs and no ones like

258
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,290
intensely flowing

259
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,439
butts reform I'm will you be decided to
remove physical puzzles because people

260
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
really enjoy him

261
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:45,780
they will enjoy getting up and doing
things that are baked they get confused

262
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,750
I'll talk about that a little bit I'm

263
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:51,070
threaded a yeah James manual which types
and correctors

264
00:13:51,070 --> 00:13:54,720
a helluva lot for me Imam Saturday
morning and

265
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,130
emergency repair kit which is actually
and these these cables here need to be

266
00:13:58,130 --> 00:14:00,680
reconnected in a certain order for the
ship to continue working

267
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,050
and if you don't talk to me stop the
shit working which is pretty funny

268
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:07,849
a.m. and this is all kinda related to
the same things I was a manual research

269
00:14:07,850 --> 00:14:09,550

00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:18,930
it was quite simple game start with I'm
and then it's a vote so this is

272
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:20,449
basically what it used to look like

273
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:23,930

real able to keep killing things are for

365
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,660

puzzle we never go

366
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,220
really got round finishing and
industrial machine he stops which

367
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:20,130
I'm Richmond you die shouldn't really
break I'm

368
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:23,860
in without benadryl I'm not the airlock
dump system that would have been really

369
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:24,260
about

370
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:28,160
but a dead laptop as my machines died on
a couple story but i wanna start by side

371
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:28,810
on the way here

372
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:33,169
but as we get the fuck with strobe
lights I'm the people tend not to run

373
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:35,660
the panicking but I read messages in
front of them

374
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:39,030
by just file their arms around shouting
I've had a cable not

375
00:19:39,030 --> 00:19:42,600
usually breaks things arms we have these
problems are problems green and maintain

376
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,780
our papers while he was still don't tend
to rate them

377
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:48,139
a if they're panicking I'm people dice
we kinda figured you know if people

378
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:51,720
a really struggling to buy this then
they're not the ones are full its ass

379
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:55,530
trying to throw too much about 13 psi
simplifying things quite a bit talking

380
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,530
computer before

381
00:19:56,530 --> 00:20:00,500
used to be a joystick thing basically
telling how to raise the choice they can

382
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,030
retire

383
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:04,480
that's gone without a doubt where she
handing the Pirates are sick inside me

384
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,960
to stick around this is what we ship
does

385
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,240
that works a bit better is and now the
doc and he has been replaced with

386
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,930
very very simple fighting which is
basically a allowing this cross with

387
00:20:13,930 --> 00:20:14,630
this cross

388
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,500
a new land safely it really simplify the
game and while they're doing out there

389
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,260
are choosing to realize the movement I
ship to fit in the bay

390
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,860
as come up with are thus the country I
wanna I wanna play with a bit more

391
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
actually die

392
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:28,860
pretty abstract a game out into small
sub games like this to controlling the

393
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,219
main game

394
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:33,550
yes please only text I will try to
balance the

395
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:37,129
the the condo oh my god it's complicated
spaceship against this is actually

396
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:37,770
playable

397
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:43,389
I am I don't design games I i've
maintain exchange service prolific site

398
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:49,110
I have no imagination I'm as obey sorry
if I i putting a lot of things wrong

399
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:51,270
with games I nope I'm slowly learning
such good

400
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:55,450
the engine is a good example of
complicated so on the left as the old

401
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:55,910
one

402
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:58,910
where the very simple screening a
balancing power your

403
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:03,330
type in K's some guarded access actually
more difficult by

404
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,178
on the right we don't have to pay an
entire bunch of switches which in are

405
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:07,890
replicated on the screen from the VA

406
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,330
abruptly laid out the same size a little
bit more intuitive I it's me start

407
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,649
thinking you can tell roughly where it's
going to be on the keyboard

408
00:21:13,650 --> 00:21:19,090
a on that but the switches a.m. we was
discovered the motion harbors a good

409
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:19,610
thing

410
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:22,870
a we should have discovered this the
easy way by Ashley breeding stuff about

411
00:21:22,870 --> 00:21:23,989
this rather than just

412
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:27,900
throwing money on things that are the
audrey has been operating these kind of

413
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,820
the polls with screw terminals on the
side of the other night I Z Trip often

414
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:31,610
put them back on again

415
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:36,010
simple AZT reporting is evil carried
over I am getting proper circuit boards

416
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,020
some point as I would keep spares
absolutely everything a.m.

417
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,850
our players really really really like I
am critical stuff

418
00:21:43,850 --> 00:21:46,350
I think they're gonna play a computer
game when you yell at them stand up and

419
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:47,469
tied up and off the wall

420
00:21:47,470 --> 00:21:50,470
as a confused look excitement what on
the price

421
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:53,880
and the government do it at this point
she's really nice because it kinda boxes

422
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:54,340
a

423
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:57,459
as a damage indicator you don't have to
read the damage despite as the hammock

424
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,950
at the ship is just take a friend

425
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:02,920
and that's usually enough I'm the James
mine was going down really well special

426
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,580
people get a firefly joke

427
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:07,600
the only firefight joke in the van is
decked out over a

428
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:14,149
I'm slip that one in but we gotta cover
to cover most procedure check messing

429
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,160
things up a task a player has taken due

430
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,960
by the record I'm quite well as well
because you got a pen there you can come

431
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:19,520
to take them off

432
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:23,770
I'm pp buns they want those BP buttons
