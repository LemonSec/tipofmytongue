that okay and bristle at

54
00:03:57,670 --> 00:04:01,458
man and what we're dealing with right
now I'm

55
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:06,040
and I'm so with similar how it feels

56
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,540
seeing what they thing is they're
thoroughly like this stuff for you

57
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,920
often feels that way for me and

58
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:18,399
what we saw his applies its a leader and
he didn't feel like a character always

59
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,370
had a

60
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:23,080
and when they walk into this area knows
how to open it and say hey

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,300
was yours as well committed to being and

62
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,310
this effort 14 it basically did didn't
actually think I've had

63
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:35,100
transporter doctor at all but I wouldn't
have budget for our moon landing zone

64
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,919
set up

65
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,250
or orlando is like landscaping stuff
like that said a

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,440
basis lol Luke like that don't worry me
and it will be quick and easy

67
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,169
sometimes whopping is used as a skill to
get from one thing to the other like

68
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,060
instead of having to warm the whole
thing

69
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,669
the lock the door in there into that
guys house whatever

70
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:56,310
or is this is like a her perky Paris
Ritz the

71
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:01,080
who was a you wanna make it past were
insisting that he or she actually is

72
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,190
you just make a lot better and sometimes
I feel like well once and thats

73
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,280
mostly in high school leaves or I

74
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,179
though that

75
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,930
Bay someone's my reaction to walking
with his or her likeness

76
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,789
and I might move beyond beijing's I'm I
feel that they're doing things then it's

77
00:05:23,789 --> 00:05:25,440
like nonsense wall

78
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,310
and maybe I'm just being the bay in all
other

79
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:32,889
but more often mafikeng movies is sorta
like the

80
00:05:32,889 --> 00:05:37,199
him and I don't know if you know the
what everyone else is there another

81
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,610
well Solothurn with what was looking at
how does it work

82
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:46,699
and nothing but a lot of a or actually
this summer

83
00:05:46,699 --> 00:05:48,230
when he spent around

84
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:52,080
a lot of cricket cell so we turn into a
whole lot

85
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,250
as a friend and he into the lot with
tools that are now that he's

86
00:05:56,250 --> 00:06:00,030
so he is a pensioner for rotating the
while in December

87
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:03,359
and with questions like to look to it

88
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,950
so you take the rotation upcoming
opening the door and use the pressure

89
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,840
manipulating the individual pays

90
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:13,630
in the lot so we should do it with her

91
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:17,830
we fine relate a lot and then find a lot
is that a

92
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:21,890
what he normally does on my feet then
third overall

93
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:27,960
so this is how he does it work be
getting server

94
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:31,400
it's for a pinata their line and the
what

95
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,150
and he added that he what's and in
spending rotated

96
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,229
without looking into the long

97
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,970
be is upside down but the line you can
actually see what the basis for the

98
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:43,700
misaligned

99
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,390
so that same ol refuse it now that bomb

100
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:54,390
will waterhole piece from you

101
00:06:54,770 --> 00:07:00,229
I think we already saw home that
something is off to a good start

102
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:03,690
so while only a few workers because
there no line

103
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:08,000
yet there are no lines they have white

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,940
what it should be and hearing all whole
where and what the

105
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,300
this fall into should be on the same
line but mister

106
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,280
for a missile I'm so we stopped turned
and remember we

107
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:24,000
kinda reverse the order is that instead
of home what your send them the whole

108
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:24,530
lot

109
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:28,030
one at a time said so you can mid-life

110
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,580
individual pieces that have been in
place all of them at the same time

111
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,830
like a forces 10 work both the lobbying
bill

112
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,550
still teach you everything about it wall

113
00:07:38,550 --> 00:07:41,660
like both for different reasons which is
interesting

114
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:44,680
that lets them picture of the European
lot

115
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,510
and on the right is a picture of
american law at for some reason

116
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:52,670
American law companies mostly month the
peace

117
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,470
that they were reverse only he with the
big actually

118
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,190
ones are I have no idea what it is lose
some kinda

119
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:03,469
the that grew in in such a way

120
00:08:03,470 --> 00:08:06,790
so the orientation of babies and

121
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:09,830
that means that any sprinter different
than the European and

122
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,150
maximum but let's get to it

123
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:16,349
film

124
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:20,229
so climb

125
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:24,199
cohan

126
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,479
I'll that com

127
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:35,198
should all but so sometimes the
character myself until I had an awful

128
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:37,909
situation and decide what are they

129
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:42,909
members mine missus is right for you so
that's like a smoke bomb think that

130
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:49,910
the like the back office RC been that's
like back to school

131
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:56,430
I'm

132
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:03,430
but

133
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,360
but even it doesn't want his weapon

134
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:10,399
you know organ yes does not harm than
good

135
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,179
that I comes over and also like them

136
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:23,179
so yeah

137
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:29,800
and he actually a you seriously managed
to open

138
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,899
I don't think it's been probably not but
let's

139
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:39,860
the scene that this is business in price
he see that it's usually use this for a

140
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,320
whole

141
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,550
by of the protagonist guess cop gets put
into handcuffs

142
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:47,390
gets locked up what's the

143
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,829
something big used to make

144
00:09:51,829 --> 00:09:56,380
have more for I'll on so

145
00:09:56,380 --> 00:10:00,630
deciding what I was thinking about life
thinking about a lot with John Lackey

146
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:04,200
still have to use it projector

147
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:08,470
children there Bruno who doesn't want

148
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:13,720
and third me at all over the line this
is like okay all

149
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:20,630
and sometimes

150
00:10:20,630 --> 00:10:24,420
they even show some techniques pretty
pretty

151
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,410
nicely this is bases that and citizens
Tom

152
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:36,410
I think it's a bank employees or
something like that

153
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:42,959
and that he may say Peter patient public
key and this is ninety

154
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:46,570
the a sort of the buchanan by like this

155
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:51,700
it has the whole like the impression
material and has like that

156
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:56,120
like that so like that easily noticeable

157
00:10:56,120 --> 00:11:01,580
class of people according to the makeup
is that you don't often they have

158
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:04,780
a love interesting shots in there

159
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,360
you know some bigshot where somebody to
keep practicing 2002 say

160
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,370
and they didn't fight back feel

161
00:11:12,370 --> 00:11:16,350
are the what kind of the state by Hannah

162
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,940
which is something that safer who let me
know you wouldn't see it when your

163
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:24,480
premise a particular facts that you can
actually

164
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,950
take a moment open up what movie was
actually working so

165
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,330
and what baby movie desi

166
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:35,880
the translated to the fewer so instead
of having to shop where they open up a

167
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,700
lot they that

168
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:40,660
oldest paper like a screen with my
camera went to the back so

169
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,120
who repent that

170
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:52,110
we have

171
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:52,660
less

172
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,670
room bottle

173
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:59,029
say so all

174
00:11:59,029 --> 00:12:02,930
while said

175
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,868
doubt that's the first time I've heard
it's a bill collector

176
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:10,050
basketball bill was under probed

177
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:15,069
best beautiful yeah

178
00:12:15,069 --> 00:12:20,709
yeah this is when this is this is nice
and wide Acer

179
00:12:20,709 --> 00:12:23,748
find like a middle ground between
realism and

180
00:12:23,749 --> 00:12:27,559
this little one show what they're doing
without breaking emerging as much so

181
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:28,019
they

182
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:32,569
with the camera and looking for some
other up cannot be used to it that way

183
00:12:32,569 --> 00:12:35,660
so the same without like drilling and

184
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,368
the whole hoping thing he's actually
practicing to do

185
00:12:40,369 --> 00:12:46,059
and play the manipulation of the dial to
say

186
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,660
later on that he had like to save the
day a

187
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:56,660
just a minute later it this on feeling
and

188
00:12:57,570 --> 00:13:01,350
me yeah

189
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,550
so the third sir are in a bind like

190
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:08,079
it's the wrong say it's not to say the
company said it would be and the glass

191
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:08,860
plate from

192
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,019
Rosa there's like to bring the last
great from K

193
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:14,930
love you

194
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,519
long

195
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:20,760
K

196
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,360
as a deadly blast lady from say that he
started grilling

197
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:28,530
it would be wrong actually cracked so
she start bringing the say

198
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:32,449
hoping that a wooden track to play and
with whom

199
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,290
you possible spoke with a look at the
law or even

200
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,540
open it and this is the point when he
basically said like shit

201
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:43,130
I had a blast playing this is midnight
they me

202
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:47,070
mister cereals and a Wii look at what
are the risks of

203
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:52,430
openness a villainous say and so that is
a lie down

204
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:55,780
we have to do the hard work that day
like many believe the whole

205
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,620
save itself I'm that

206
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:07,620
so they just a tad bit

207
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,350
and ends

208
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:13,700
this is a break but that would take
notes a

209
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:17,730
but I must say you get some let it be
that is a move lol

210
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,470
Dayton you just know it the high and the
lows when you're

211
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:24,520
manipulating and yeah hope to come up
with a number

212
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,189
war

213
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:30,000
well well just because it's going to be
more than

214
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,020
more than and is nice as officials the
internet somebody with her we're doing

215
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:36,699
more

216
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:40,740
so outlets for

217
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,180
flown for you

218
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:47,989
businessperson impress and oh yeah that
her

219
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,340
oversee a bumpy third

220
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,860
but something a lot was pretty 13 pool

221
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:58,120
when I think you see would like to use
the bomb

222
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:01,920
Hewitt that this problem and

223
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,199
well okay he plays the moving on and if
there's some may be an important to me

224
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:06,890
that way

225
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:11,240
and but nice because in the series that
he had

226
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:14,250
baby Bay higher an apartment is a
building

227
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,540
so they have access to the Blind Pig use
or to a similar

228
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:20,920
he didn't use the building and if you
use that he too made

229
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,010
a button that's the only thing you need
to make a bomb

230
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,470
he similar he'd already its in my
profile

231
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:34,470
%um so this is is nice and

232
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:40,310
but he I shoulda from this point for
Liam

233
00:15:40,310 --> 00:15:43,670
its planes over

234
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,030
and this

235
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,800
to line

236
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,339
won't be held

237
00:15:54,339 --> 00:15:57,240
you

238
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,240
and there's actually another movie that

239
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,600
pretty pretty nice as he comes I'll

240
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,070
Wednesday maybe I'll skip through it
because is

241
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,709
feelin but with it one of the best
depiction of bumpy

242
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:18,510
lobby has seen the movie so far say look

243
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,920
and misleading and I actually haven't
seen this movie

244
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,689
to Liana I don't think they've been

245
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:29,800
I think this is why doesn't kill need
for the light

246
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:35,240
done it a lot so mean research is hoping
that the 48 life has been hell

247
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:38,310
neck she turns to you to purchase
crossover

248
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:43,089
on yes he gets like that occurred or how
to make the company

249
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:47,050
any kind either there in home for
creditor

250
00:16:47,050 --> 00:16:50,839
confronted own a house here also down

251
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,839
make a bumpy there

252
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:00,540
there

253
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:03,469
ok and he like new practice at home

254
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:08,630
I mean they process

255
00:17:08,630 --> 00:17:11,910
so numbers about acquiring the plant
needs

256
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:15,620
because me that land at with the Libyan

257
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:18,689
and this

258
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,089
one of the buildings that have a similar
kind elevator said he

259
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,250
conceived by the lateness of its and
steals

260
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,860
the maintenance he are the elevator but

261
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:32,729
border in elevator let me knows it's the
same land so we can modify it to me

262
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:39,730
about before elevator that won't happen

263
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,520
fun

264
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,520
done

265
00:18:00,310 --> 00:18:07,310
gold ground

266
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:43,320
it

267
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,480
home

268
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:50,350
lol savor the moment know who they say

269
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:53,350
well he is if he had done to the utmost
that

270
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:56,990
its Remi you careful using it and

271
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,149
yes to both up with them key in the lock

272
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:06,389
and later on they will have to find out
so this this is funny if this message in

273
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:07,428
a sense that it's

274
00:19:07,429 --> 00:19:12,630
what we think is no who if you like it
or a key component that we can spend

275
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:14,539
like our home from a lot

276
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:18,570
if I want the bike paths to break the
lock this is

277
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,740
an important thing that he'd taken to
done

278
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:28,740
the lucky one of their own one of the
better

279
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,389
the patient lot speaking in a movie at
most proceeds will be donated to

280
00:19:34,389 --> 00:19:38,090
she's not a psychopath war

281
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:41,220
and he managed to slip like a paper
plate a

282
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,080
before she was being like with back into
our bad

283
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,370
like being a restrained and checking
uses blood cell

284
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:56,370
for like to lock a bennett the paperclip
and it is nothing like that

285
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,840
I'm

286
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:41,840
and it

287
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:46,670
and he refuses the same because I feel
like

288
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,760
the open the door small but

289
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:53,150
as you'll see when he's to open in her
room nor

290
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:56,450
he doesn't use a paperclip a

291
00:20:56,450 --> 00:21:00,410
to their mid late fees but he also uses
second be

292
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:03,840
to do turn emotion so

293
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,560
he effectively has both the tensioner
and the lobby

294
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,090
and that's where most movies no longer
feel one more

295
00:21:11,090 --> 00:21:14,629
not known to us all and

296
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,960
well moving up hunky came to

297
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,670
the big here as realistic as a day it
doesn't have that

298
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:25,680
they did actually walk a lot of people
some of whom so

299
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,710
in order to see this is he actually had
a lot of people are

300
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:32,170
before they with it seems that is a
made-up

301
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:36,140
up unit okay let's

302
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:43,140
you know and he okay

303
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,380
so I told my and doesn't mean I don't
know

304
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,100
what they all have in common wat
transformers

305
00:21:53,100 --> 00:22:00,100
listen closely

306
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:06,260
the rule

307
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,620
low

308
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,799
I and

309
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:14,049
basically a a lot to be done is

310
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:17,059
like percussive instrument you get like
that

311
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:20,100
hit on the peace and hope that the
separator

312
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,290
not specially the allowed to open the
ball

313
00:22:24,290 --> 00:22:28,678
I'll try and show it to the I think we
have a nation of this

314
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:32,370
what the SEC that I'm

315
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:38,370
lobbying done well maybe

316
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:42,250
the Portland he found flip through the
pages

317
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:45,299
and want to separate these arm

318
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:50,280
the shoreline so you know I think you if
you turn and this is it not worth it

319
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:53,370
allowed to open a lot release

320
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:57,840
make the snap a nice imagine how
electric one that does it several times

321
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,970
a second sound doesn't sound like a plan
for

322
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:03,230
I hope that someplace that is doing his

323
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:08,110
or well what is interesting is that

324
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,979
in that movie Hey

325
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,250

326
00:23:14,250 --> 00:23:17,750

327
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:21,040
good that have a lot of weight like

328
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:25,590

doesn't look that we honestly if the

329

wall

330
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,290

331
00:23:30,290 --> 00:23:37,290
to make a for the okay

332
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,560
and into the sound

333
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,980
is that okay so

334
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:57,980

335
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:02,409

up with their armored you life changing
tires done

360
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:51,510
actually this is without a doubt the
best way

361
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:55,240
to open or get into someone's house

362
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:02,240
in lock picking

363
00:26:13,830 --> 00:26:20,830

movie and some kinda

369
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,860
somewhere it happens so I pose the same
question to you

370
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,899
I put a link on their it should redirect
to

371
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:53,750
the spreadsheet I'll try and put it
online somewhere else later

stuff like that I was robbed and thank
you for listening the

375
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,360

time for one maybe two questions

376
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:16,189
are we going to go about 3 minutes 0
only actual questions not

377
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:21,090
more to comment ask a question really so
hands up if you got a natural question

378
00:27:21,090 --> 00:27:28,090
that's under 140 characters right to ask
add up all the questions I'm sorry about

379
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,240
