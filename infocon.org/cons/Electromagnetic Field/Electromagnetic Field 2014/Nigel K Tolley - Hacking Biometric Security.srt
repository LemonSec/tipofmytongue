cheap damn

44
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:49,730
expect any PC door and they have clout
walking

45
00:02:49,730 --> 00:02:51,440
and

46
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,930
I doesn't utilize Bluetooth as much it
sold on eBay

47
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:58,240
gsm/gprs and so I've obtained one

48
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:02,360
I'm and with the help with a look at
that face guys stripped it down to its

49
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,190
ban of things to say exactly how to
implement it

50
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:08,920

the point knife

51
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,030
I have the faintest idea what about
breaking it and so

52
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:15,830
that one is particularly good a
brilliant out great

53
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:19,560

millimeters long

54
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,960
a house full of integration inside with
them but unlock

55
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,810

doesn't work because the link together

56
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:30,850
which really quite funky so I haven't
seen this pays the harbour

57
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,400

61
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,160
portion

nice things way

159
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:41,590
it will work longs no know we will
investigate why it works and then it

160
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:43,420
will end up being in different fields
where

161
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:47,219
issues at it's a great idea I just think
that

162
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,250
again probing speak to some people who
was looking guy

163
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,400
well okay is a great idea mark think
about this and this and this

164
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:58,120
I'm for example documentation

165
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,700
on fingerprints is issue for everybody
Prince where you go

166
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,470

167
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,720
congregate them just doctors expect

168
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,210
adult they come back right the only way
to get it off the fingers of

169
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:14,830

because you're you know

170
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,040
you to weeping if you fancy palmitic
locking

171
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,900
his eyes

172
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:27,640
other parts I more

173
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:32,740
is actually so few

174
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:39,740
key

175
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,760
or wrong

176
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,330
its bid Parker heart

177
00:10:46,330 --> 00:10:48,620
this plea

178
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,840
lock shoes them examined

179
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:55,040
it makes it so much more

180
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,929
apartment not too much gets overlooked
but

181
00:10:57,929 --> 00:11:01,089
gets not because it's week too well

182
00:11:01,089 --> 00:11:04,109
this dog costumes yes costly spends it

183
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:07,579
head she Angie sent them out get actual

184
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:11,439
feedback and reply so gold-plated

185
00:11:11,439 --> 00:11:15,089
lines me if if you look software

186
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:18,569
writing software US operations prairie

187
00:11:18,569 --> 00:11:21,608
so if if somebody finds for

188
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:24,999
you great the same selfridge like

189
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,410
actually years if they songs

190
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:31,779
america's are their define something

191
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,959
long the hardware is basically start for

192
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,069
scratch build a new one complete you so

193
00:11:38,069 --> 00:11:41,069
any money you festers initially

194
00:11:41,069 --> 00:11:45,169
reason be yes matter

195
00:11:45,169 --> 00:11:47,410
possible

196
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:50,560
people to keep you do not know and

197
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:55,109
losses nipple mark some you can just be
like

198
00:11:55,110 --> 00:11:58,379
this how does if you find for

199
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,920
and responsible or making world fix the
problem and I'm

200
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:07,420
I would say every manufactures
responsible problem

201
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:11,050
some there's no definition of proper

202
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,359
so you think about some hardware

203
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,439
secure world

204
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:22,199
you to put on the security tested
there's to finish

205
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:26,248
prosecutors sorry go out to them most

206
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:30,480
Baker like you look at his locker and
try to open it for about five minutes

207
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:35,249
he feels probably will he's I can't put
on the package

208
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:38,809
its tested by profession mom

209
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,600
because cassese job

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:46,059
yet but has the same answer different
electrical bill to give me smalls

211
00:12:46,059 --> 00:12:49,579
with most lot between us will Crockett
might take a while

212
00:12:49,579 --> 00:12:54,170
but we'll get that the most precious
metal no is a pic group pic resist yet

213
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,319
exist bump resistant cause I mean

214
00:12:57,319 --> 00:13:00,779
we know Carlo loss names there

215
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:04,910
you get questions a lot like what these
people look

216
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,118
doesn't exist me

217
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:11,179
every lock K but for some lunch just

218
00:13:11,179 --> 00:13:15,309
figure out its its

219
00:13:15,309 --> 00:13:20,730
there is no such thing as sense Mitchell
at the time to on the month to Ginny

220
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:24,220
some lock you money four hours one intro
to doctor impractical to enter new

221
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,209
business and picked up

222
00:13:25,209 --> 00:13:28,790
in particular if you've left the back
door open all the windows like Paul

223
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:32,488
you know for yet there's their locks
that

224
00:13:32,489 --> 00:13:35,910
in practical terms nobody's ever gonna
send pic what your front door

225
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:39,339
it is also the security aspect things
wanna

226
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:42,609
French manufactures will only sell with
the new door

227
00:13:42,609 --> 00:13:48,749
I'm this means that it's been very very
difficult physically

228
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:51,889
showing 3-d yeah is be shiny

229
00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:56,360
possible yesterday and how much they
offers to buy no problem

230
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,179
to mass about them just because you get
one lakh open doesn't mean you can get

231
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:00,769
and no they

232
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:04,449
seemingly identical occupancy need a
resource I selection to be able to say

233
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:07,479
with some degree confidence you know we
can do that

234
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,429
so the exothermic to for locking just
pull wholesale

235
00:14:11,429 --> 00:14:14,549
be getting looks nice discount them

236
00:14:14,549 --> 00:14:18,290
it's there comes an artistic that
someone lock

237
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,569
which you can't break

238
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,710
and thus the manufactured homes on your
side and day yes his

239
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,630
Knox ago does work there it's not gonna
happen to

240
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:31,189
bakery second-hand market so when the
manufacture determine

241
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:34,190
the decides to try and prevent that from
happening

242
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:37,570
to keep their security it burns pretty

243
00:14:37,570 --> 00:14:40,620
and them but we do get it students get
past

244
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:45,720
think well passage but there are some
manufactures decompose

245
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,870
we don't think either one question so
Paul I Q no more questions

246
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,280
hose long pressed we gotta go so if you
can travel about

247
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:58,370
yet people are questioning just go to
another basically without the terror

248
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:01,370
law humana

249
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:05,040
be a good question yet please be

250
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,959
question by then about that but I was at
Lee

251
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:13,250
lockpicking village s and got into my
first few lakhs you recommend any

252
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,540
resources to

253
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:19,030
go further what water to open a loss

254
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:22,550
yes oh understand by some more locks
play with their

255
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:26,149
get used what I used to do

256
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,080
or gusted to wanting worry based

257
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,320
Milton Keynes the

258
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,050
there's loads mean there are hot space
and so on. however is a massive massive

259
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,189
online communities

260
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,510
where can't speak to what many people
sometimes even im

261
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:44,459
was in the mood me and Leatherwood you
can sit and chat but the

262
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,069
the first thing you need to do practice
so if you have a pic set

263
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,000
yes not safety by one the pictures that
we saw

264
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,779
at a guess so yet we all know what
picture have and so on

265
00:15:55,779 --> 00:15:59,339
practice for those and then practice
home picking locks

266
00:15:59,339 --> 00:16:02,540
the baxley it's a struggle and struggle

267
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:07,579
and struggle and then 1 day 0 click then
we want to the second what are open

268
00:16:07,579 --> 00:16:11,969
which is trouble and after a while you
build up and a repertoire block you

269
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:12,370
compare

270
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,209
and then you'll find one that refuses to
pay no matter what you do it will not

271
00:16:16,209 --> 00:16:16,619
work

272
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,209
and that's the point you've got you by
experience you got practice

273
00:16:20,209 --> 00:16:24,420
you've got a question to ask I have this
law instrument picket you speak to

274
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,990
anyone so many of the pickup

275
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:29,660
will talk you through my she video
b.tech and at that point you

276
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:33,089
building OPP you're experiencing rapid
what what and then

277
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:37,120
you 10 it was bheegi you try and find a
lot to be calm

278
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,839
Apple particularly walks all the people
you look up tonight might struggle with

279
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:44,070
I look in what he called back and the
same because now with

280
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:47,980
I'll do if it kills me you actually to
make and after a while

281
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:51,430
you wake up one morning and think shit

282
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,140
that's a little auks in you like right
decision to keep going you want on the

283
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,439
market just to try and break

284
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,060
there

285
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,449
to stop it big thing especially for me

287
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:09,959
again to leave the forums on IRC and
things like that were

288
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:14,490
constant competition lots going around
if you're in an area where you're

289
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:15,359
interested in

290

305
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,550
scrap at that point you can get as many
