1
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,350
do

2
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,919
when a good time

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,140
I did just got here safe I'm

4
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,260
my tenth over there still think a have
monies back is avail

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:27,290
and i'm talking about buying multiple
train tickets

6
00:00:27,290 --> 00:00:32,890
a how you can save quite a bit of money
so if you don't know I'm gonna website

7
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:35,910
court train times told a UK the

8
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:39,029
takes the data from the official website
and

9
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:45,180
displays it's with much less comp I have
nice you all else like this and have

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:47,530
nice day handling and solve a pretty in

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,719
if you need to look up train times in
the UK I recommend you

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,890
use this and bookmark it and and I've
got a whole page bookmarked on my phone

13
00:00:54,890 --> 00:00:55,399
for

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:59,680
looking up it's got some other bits and
pieces on it like a a live map

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,080
have turned underground we show told the
two trains on the London Underground

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,179
insulin real time a which

17
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,039
somebody said was possibly the coolest
uses the Internet a

18
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:15,090
I'm not gonna disagree although it's
clearly not I'll

19
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:19,430
better and I'm not talking about the
camping time talk about the strange

20
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:22,650
day you can reserve their train
ticketing system so

21
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:26,030
we're gonna go with an example journey
which is a train from bal

22
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:30,280
Sparta Birmingham New Street on you're
going for the day

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,189
it's a work trip you leaving out 8
o'clock in the morning

24
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:38,408
there's the URL to look about journey to
find out what time it is

25
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,240
and if you do not go find the you catch
the train is 759

26
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,000
from Bob's bar which gets into Bristol a
quarter past eight and then you have a

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:47,750
10-minute

28
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:51,030
also a way to change over Bristol and
you catch the train to Birmingham

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:55,170
no which liza half-baked gets into
birmingham a five to 10

30
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:59,130
and calls at Bristol in Cheltenham on
the way this is fascinating bear with me

31
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:03,548
if you went to the station and ask for a
ticket for that time

32
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:06,909
how on the day in the morning you
haven't booked in advance for anything

33
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:10,649
it would cost 209 pounds which is

34
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:15,829
quite a lot many really on although he
was paying its alright but even then you

35
00:02:15,829 --> 00:02:16,739
wanna save your

36
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:21,360
to work money if you can %uh so on

37
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,190
there's an alternative to New p.m. know
the time if the

38
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:28,530
train leaving Bristol is a half ain't
and know that the train calls at Bristol

39
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,370
in Cheltenham

40
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:33,430
so let's try this journey different
light so

41
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:37,870
we buy ticket from both the Bristol
which costs pippen 20

42
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:42,330
for Davidson we've got to keep from
Bristol to Cheltenham

43
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:46,280
which cost eight-pound eighty as long as
you're leaving after B-twenty nine in

44
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,880
the morning

45
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,850
so that's good cuz we leaving a half
ain't and you my ticket from children to

46
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:52,489
Birmingham

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,450
which cost thirty six pounds fifty for
any time a tent and I don't if anyone

48
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,220
can do the ads

49
00:02:57,220 --> 00:03:00,650
quite quickly burn that 3053 Pam 50

50
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,290
hun and flowers exactly the same trains

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,530
exactly the same journey with exactly
the same validity

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:11,660
you don't have to buy the tickets in
advance for any different

53
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:15,549
you just buy three train tickets is that
a by 1:10 ticket

54
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:18,940
and it's half the price which shows you

55
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:22,270
what a stupid system the UK National
trains are

56
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:28,230
on so you can get even cheaper if you
don't have to go to Harvard

57
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:31,320
then the children to burning take it
becomes an off peak ticket

58
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:35,220
and you have any 30-40 times for the
whole journey although then

59
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:38,769
you can't leave Birmingham between half
to me in court past six

60
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:41,989
because came to Kansas to pretty
complicated

61
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:46,260
he is an example of my colleague Ben

62
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,600
buying all those tickets to come and
visit me from baja

63
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
to Birmingham they sold in the tickets
they have to send you ever tickets you

64
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:56,920
ask or so you just turn up and say I'd
like a ticket to Bristol

65
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:00,458
and then a ticket from Bristol chillin
and then a ticket from children to

66
00:04:00,459 --> 00:04:01,070
Birmingham

67
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:05,760
an OK who you are that's 53 pounds since
the 109 times

68
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,959
so

69
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,720
just a few there was some all these
places where you can always do this so

70
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,359
Cheltenham

71
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,720
and Bambi a2 well new stations where if
you buy tickets to them and then onwards

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,109
you can save money %uh the train
operating companies last year released

73
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,169
all their data is our Open Data which
was great

74
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:27,750
and it meant that someone could
potentially take all that data

75
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,770
and make a website how they were you
just David the form

76
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:35,659
and the two in the time honey we can't
play went to spit your tickets for you

77
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:40,330
so I did that and as a split stock claim
time sold out UK

78
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:44,460
I'm not the example journey there on

79
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:49,190
you give it you can at the time where
you can you can get return time too if

80
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,150
you want optionally

81
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,219
to help it look up maybe you want when
you gonna come back on as well

82
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:57,300
they have lots of caveats and anything
you do you should check

83
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:02,039
yourself that is gonna be founded um I
don't guarantee it was also might anyway

84
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,039
although I use it

85
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,180
whenever I'm traveling I am it doesn't
do pal cards

86
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:14,300
or travel console overcome with all
sorts of special education has been for

87
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,460
Lulu turning up in catching 10

88
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:19,710
yarn it was quite well um

89
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,210
I could do a live demo now

90
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:26,460
if anybody has come from somewhere that
might work

91
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,989
so if anyone when did when did anyone
come from

92
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:34,660
preferably somewhere in the South West
England I will be good cuz I know that

93
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:35,340
will work

94
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,530
a but they say they're safe you sir

95
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:45,530
invisible man over there came from
Exeter basket

96
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:59,909
so hugely this live demo so you know
it's gonna go along

97
00:05:59,910 --> 00:06:05,070
own everyday 115 pounds down to ninety
three

98
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:10,400
ther I think it will be the main fight
for the North Peak anyway we were going

99
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,020
early enough

100
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:15,510
repeated but even then if you by tikki
from x2 to Bristol a ticket from Vestal

101
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,610
Cheltenham in a ticket from seven to
Bristol

102
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:22,830
you save twenty quid um and that's
basically it

103
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:26,609
her tell everyone tell your friends a
tell all your enemies

104
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,730
and they would have any questions and

105
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,100
are this is interesting so

106
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,420
when I look to the Open Data the
question was why do we have such a

107
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,350
stupid system

108
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:44,060
%uh so unlike downloaded or the Fed
state space form

109
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,780
but I don't think companies it basically
was the worst

110
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:52,859
it is like it a lot of text files and is
basically if you match in a database

111
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,320
that was invented in the early seventies

112
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,880
and then every time something is changed
they just put some more stuff on top

113
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,500
for forty years and that is basically

114
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,340
what is today it's still the same system
that they were using in the seventies as

115
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,489
far as I can make out

116
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,610
just with every possible donation a
ticket

117
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,260
when by 1am when they when a simplified
the tickets a few years ago to make them

118
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:16,690
just

119
00:07:16,690 --> 00:07:21,980
anytime off-peak or advance they didn't
actually simplify the database in

120
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:26,060
anyway they just renamed 18 types have
ticket booth to

121
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:30,330
off-peak in the database there are still
18 times a ticket

122
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,890
they just all called off-peak so and so
what when the front end the Justice of

123
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:35,240
Peace

124
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,620
now but the database so I think you
talked to two people with the name

125
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,470
instructions or the pic so yeah

126
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:42,500
I think one days put your gonna collapse

127
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,630
and I don't know what they gonna do then
burr i commercial they know how it works

128
00:07:45,630 --> 00:07:46,650
anymore either

129
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:49,789
but yeah it's a 40-year-old database
basically

130
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,890
and that just means disorder thing just
has to happen cuz this just

131
00:07:53,890 --> 00:08:00,890
is just so complicated

132
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:04,750
up

133
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:07,690
in the hope that has a stop somewhere
yes I said the important the important

134
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,219
thing I didn't say thank you

135
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:12,300
on the way this works your trade has to
stop

136
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,780
at the Pike Place when you swap for one
ticket to the other see if there's no

137
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:19,010
if there's no stops between the two then
there's there's nothing you can do

138
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:22,409
um the london is also have a

139
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,550
London is harder to find one Geno from
the boot write this because

140
00:08:26,550 --> 00:08:30,380
that their London is so complicated
itself a tortoise different stations and

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:30,810
stuff

142
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,299
%uh and is and big day they have a lot
of people coming in and out to the mall

143
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,189
so many opportunities

144
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:39,810
if they'd take a long time but the point
is there to keep them to keep it like

145
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:40,059
that

146
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:44,689
%uh to Jenny's lonely jaded I know
someone someone went for a day trip from

147
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:46,150
Manchester to Oxford

148
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:50,100
and it was fifty seven pounds instead of
the 157 pounds

149
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:54,540
and they bought six tickets to do that
ok I'll just be not one up

150
00:08:54,540 --> 00:09:01,540
any other questions

151
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:04,980
ha

152
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:10,020
ha %uh

153
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:17,020

154
00:09:23,709 --> 00:09:29,800
I denied in for the but in Verona ho k

155
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,910

156
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,100
ha

157
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:44,439
fine

158
00:09:44,439 --> 00:09:45,889
show on tho

159
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:49,620
feasible put in the we're trying find
them all the same type its findings

160
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:49,990
though

161
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:53,110
vaculated hairs which Congo by more than
inflation

162
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:57,699
arm by law as you say and these the
dispersed but wonder the same type of

163
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:58,959
ticket is the main one

164
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:02,430
so they've all like that bar to
Birmingham to get them all they kill

165
00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:02,989
aidid

166
00:10:02,990 --> 00:10:06,879
by law that'll its and he thought it
would seem like

167
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:10,980
one company sets the small price a
different company says the big price

168
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:14,029
and that companies put up the price
quicker than the other company

169
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:18,879
tho I cross country in virgin shot the
price above the long journeys

170
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:22,749
where the small journeys cuz they were
commuted involved in got so quickly and

171
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:25,249
that made the difference quite a lot
especially around Cheltenham

172
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:28,459
hmm bf sometimes they were it doesn't do
it

173
00:10:28,459 --> 00:10:31,930
the on making a fez is the advanced ones
this doesn't look at them at all only

174
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:32,329
the

175
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:39,329
only the one for you can turn up on the
day

176
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:48,370
so

177
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:52,050
yeah well I am if you've got a normal
mail cart then it would just be the same

178
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:57,329
you could just take a third of if you've
got if you got the Network Rail card

179
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,200
which is the bill come for the South
East England then yes the extra things

180
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:01,980
you can do

181
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,180
to like buy a ticket to the edge in the
mail call boundary

182
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,469
and then a new ticket for the southeast
bit me when she s it'll handle but on

183
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:13,640
the veil card as a whole extra level of
complexity because it's some

184
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:16,819
its homes it's got its own databases to
move because the

185
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:20,320
they'll come to their own exceptions and
just as complicated on top other

186
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,790
already complicated bits but they do
there's a $5 ticket

187
00:11:24,790 --> 00:11:28,030
a5 take a journey to save seventy pounds

188
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:35,030
eighty pounds though he'd be difficult
it cheaper than that

189
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,770
yeah they've at it thanks very much
