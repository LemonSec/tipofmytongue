1
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:12,950
though

2
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,610
over here

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,980
Regina

4
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:21,140
I'm so my real name is an elaborate and
most people know me as Black Swan

5
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:22,160
burster BSP

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,090
I am I'm going to talk about industrial
control system security

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,029
I don't expect many have you work in
this space

8
00:00:31,029 --> 00:00:35,180
and if you do you and this will be very
abstract

9
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,650
and and you can get more technical
detail later

10
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:43,210
we can hang out have to talk if you
would like this going to be a rambling

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,370
crazy talk because I'm rambling crazy
person and

12
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,030
butts the main thing is a good talk
should be like a comma

13
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,489
rights with dazzling and brilliant and
over in a flash and i cant really manage

14
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:56,288
the first two saw em for the latter

15
00:00:56,289 --> 00:01:00,890
so it's gonna move really quickly okay
so

16
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:05,309
before beginning like to have some idea
up who is in the audience

17
00:01:05,309 --> 00:01:10,170
I am who is here at im at Camp last
right

18
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,140
cool and this year him a camp this time

19
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,600
good just making sure your way and are
there any other hackers in the audience

20
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,759
in the security settings

21
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:23,770
s okay any white hats

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:27,740
the Black Cats and intelligence agents

23
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:32,580
never raise their hand others one
excellent fantastic I'm

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,890
okay will get on with industrial control
system security so

25
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,259
I don't usually like to talk too much
about myself but

26
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:42,500
since many if you don't know me you
probably want to have some ideas my

27
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,310
credentials

28
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,739
and instead of giving you a giant CV
have all the places I've worked in the

29
00:01:47,739 --> 00:01:48,509
hundreds have

30
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,300
a engagements that I've done testing
industrial systems

31
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,270
others give you this picture to give you
a sense and

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:59,950
I've been doing this for about two and
half years

33
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:01,700
a as a

34
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:05,600
and industrial person if you if you like
what I mean by that is I've been a

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,690
penetration tester researcher for I'll
active last two and half years

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,730
before that I was doing a Masters in
Cambridge where rescue 10,000 industrial

37
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:13,820
systems from the internet

38
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:19,070
for a lot I am and before that I worked
at GE Energy and quality assurance

39
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,959
testing various demand and

40
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,400
systems so you know distribution
management systems for the electric grid

41
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,180
primarily but also other systems used in
the electric sector

42
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:35,080
and before that I was doing other stuff
that's not terribly interest

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,630
so I think people should care more about

44
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:43,620
infrastructure in general particularly
geeks particularly im at Camp I think

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,080
infrastructures really interesting

46
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,750
I think we all depend on a and and I
could make a big hand wavy argument

47
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,410
about things blowing up and what would
happen if we didn't have water

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,480
power i think thats all kinda bit boring
instead what I'd rather do is encourage

49
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,609
you to think about

50
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,890
infrastructure care about infrastructure
going to visit find out in your local

51
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,690
neighborhood what's going on wanna
things is really exciting about you have

52
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,130
cam

53
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:09,239
is you actually have that opportunity my
favorite talk the last year my camp was

54
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,950
how we rolled out power I sanitation and
showers

55
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,609
to you guys for three days and along
with internet

56
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:20,330
and then toward all down and drove away
and so if you're interested in some of

57
00:03:20,330 --> 00:03:22,459
these things go and find out how someone
who works here

58
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,820
when I was about 14 and my mother who is
and

59
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,079
risley analogous to sarah connor

60
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:33,140
made me build a water filter a.m. to
teach me about

61
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,720
water filtration and as much as it was
like a really you're taking things have

62
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:39,150
to do is a 14-year-old like her mom

63
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,239
I don't build a water filter I'm I did

64
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,150
right and at the end I learned a lot
about how to clear us and other water

65
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:48,660
filter and had a dried-out Massana make
sure it in

66
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,109
you know getting out the infection or
anything else I'm and and signed heard

67
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,489
you to do the same sort things

68
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,920
embrace some little project on
infrastructure and find out more about a

69
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,959
and even if you're not

70
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,340
a program error or a hacker's security
sense I

71
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:06,390
you know just get interested in this
stuff right so this is a a brief tour

72
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:10,559
love my kind of help and why industrial
system security so

73
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,950
difficult and but also where it can be
really excited

74
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:18,550
maybe some research opportunities for
you so

75
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,920
relax a good joke an optimist would say
the glasses

76
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,310
you know half-full has missed half empty
but the engineer

77
00:04:25,310 --> 00:04:29,340
believes is over provisions for this
particular task and I use this to

78
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:31,580
illustrate the kind of people that I
work with Reid

79
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,280
I do you have the a bachelors of
engineering but I'm also computer

80
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,140
scientist now

81
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:39,780
I started artificial intelligence and a
family stuff lumped into the comp ski

82
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,309
camp by all the engineers

83
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,200
and and that's okay so when we sit down
have conversations they have very

84
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,430
different attitude and

85
00:04:46,430 --> 00:04:50,410
I'm trying to use this to to illustrate
that part about this talk is going to go

86
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,230
straight today

87
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:55,700
is a false dichotomy that I see in space
between safety

88
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,150
and security so do you mean by that

89
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,260
right in everyone understands that
safety in an industrial system is

90
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,330
incredibly important

91
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:07,500
right you're dealing with inert gases
them I fill

92
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:11,700
a cont find space you dealing with
family or materials right if you work in

93
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,450
oil and gas

94
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:15,760
I with electricity you know there's
danger be shocked

95
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,180
or and providing too much electricity or
bad

96
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,250
frequency of power to the device and
burning down somewhere right

97
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:27,120
I was water are you dealing with large
pressures and you can have a burst

98
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,970
because that so

99
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,310
what do we mean by safety on on a sort
of computational level

100
00:05:32,310 --> 00:05:35,360
means that we don't want I am

101
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,710
we don't want change on these devices
without knowing about

102
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:42,460
so you don't wanna firmware upgrade in
the middle a

103
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,599
pumping water into a giant tank

104
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:49,410
right because that upgrade could could
leave the messages that are there

105
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:50,790
passing on that network

106
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,650
in a state that it continues to pump and
builds up too much pressure and I the

107
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,560
bronze at the pump

108
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,320
or or blows the tank in some way so were
focused on

109
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:02,480
no change without permission loosely
speaking and

110
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,840
that I can be change values Picasa be
change it from where

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,739
or changer devices and there is some
redundancy in the system's

112
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:12,129
but from a security perspective
redundancy doesn't do

113
00:06:12,129 --> 00:06:16,089
very much for us right because if I can
compromise once which I can compromise

114
00:06:16,089 --> 00:06:16,729
the other

115
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:20,739
and and since some you don't work in the
space

116
00:06:20,739 --> 00:06:24,058
that that is what I D lately I've been
focusing on compromising industrial

117
00:06:24,059 --> 00:06:26,909
Ethernet switches changing their
firmware writing malicious rumors

118
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:30,069
and abusing the the

119
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:33,129
firmwares to alter the traffic that's
fine cross those networks

120
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:38,050
okay so the important thing here is that
safety people have an assumption

121
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,009
and the assumption is that the the co 2
the firmware has not been changed

122
00:06:43,009 --> 00:06:46,649
without going through proper channels
because they have these processes in

123
00:06:46,649 --> 00:06:47,580
place they say

124
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,669
don't touch this device don't change
this device and

125
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:54,479
unknowns come to them and said okay to
change that device then they believe

126
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,050
it's on the same state it was

127
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:59,339
when they started and in a physical
world

128
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:02,769
that's a relatively good assumption you
can keep your eyes on things but in the

129
00:07:02,769 --> 00:07:03,550
digital world

130
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:07,999
that's not always true prime in
particular I find that the hardware and

131
00:07:07,999 --> 00:07:08,679
firmware

132
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:13,568
don't support these features right so I
can you say an md5 were shot 256 check

133
00:07:13,569 --> 00:07:17,599
on firmware and but the device

134
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:20,679
itself in industrial system doesn't
always do those checks

135
00:07:20,679 --> 00:07:25,089
on Sun run okay so about the the
security culture

136
00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,189
we run around like a heads are on fire
we panicked when tell your body patched

137
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,679
up because they're using tell not

138
00:07:30,679 --> 00:07:34,739
and and that sometimes a little bit
unfair especially in a working

139
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,289
operational environment we make safety
people crazy because we're asking them

140
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:40,839
to change things that are already
functionally safe

141
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:44,249
and and the fact that they've had to go
through months a

142
00:07:44,249 --> 00:07:48,539
and proving to some auditor that this is
functionally safe

143
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:52,269
means that when they update at they have
to go through that whole process have

144
00:07:52,269 --> 00:07:53,019
six months old

145
00:07:53,019 --> 00:07:57,490
approving it again and I can be deeply
deeply frustrating for them

146
00:07:57,490 --> 00:08:01,029
so the assumption on the security
persons par is that has

147
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,379
it has been changed unless you prove it
hasn't been changed

148
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,829
right someone has altered the firmware
when you weren't looking are you weren't

149
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:08,669
paying attention

150
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:11,959
I need to consistently verify the
firmware some device

151
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:15,610
and has not been changed now you can
also talk about this in terms protocols

152
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:16,919
does not be the firmware right

153
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,639
the the traffic on the wire can be
altered as well and you want some sort

154
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,349
of cryptographic assurance that hasn't
been altered

155
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:27,199
now I'm because I've worn this

156
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,430
preposterous was a moustache today I'm
I'm going to demonstrate this

157
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:33,440
in the most ridiculous way I possibly
could I'm

158
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,849
whether the cartridge so

159
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:42,990
to prepare for this trip and

160
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:47,010
money to you said you know the Deccan
fans get some people to inspect it

161
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:51,080
get some people to you help me out and
verifying the condition

162
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,490
up this particular attack a I know you
guys

163
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:59,100
miss by not started this and because I
know these guys coming over here

164
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,200
and at the end and %uh the talk I'm you
need eleven people to help me out for

165
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:03,610
this

166
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:07,810
am so hopefully you can be willing to
volunteer come forward because if y'all

167
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,630
just stand back tears can be very very
awkward and

168
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,470
generous let's make sure this is a real
the cards and its shuffle dance

169
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:20,470
different

170
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:10,170
alright certainly use this as a
demonstration a

171
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:13,540
you know firmware and being altered
which

172
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:16,829
and Anna like I say the bottom is a
terribly shoehorned metaphor about

173
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:20,790
because an excuse to be strange animal
my talk so on a set this aside right

174
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:21,680
here on the stop at

175
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,979
and it's your job to watch this decade
cards and be sure that it doesn't change

176
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,710
order

177
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:32,500
somehow during the need to address the
top clemency to

178
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:39,040
ca

179
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,399
okay

180
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:43,499
so this photograph I took while I was on
holiday and I think it

181
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:49,019
demonstrates pretty much I'm when the
conflicts between safety and security

182
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:52,429
now I realize that you probably can't
see this very well

183
00:10:52,429 --> 00:10:57,540
saw a point out some details in but take
a look after the right this is a

184
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,610
is a medical device for helping restart
heart

185
00:11:00,610 --> 00:11:05,069
for said right safety first but it does
have an access code

186
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:08,849
downside and if you can see these
buttons alongside here

187
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:14,439
and written on top of that device

188
00:11:14,439 --> 00:11:17,910
is the access code to

189
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,929
88 I guess ass so that people can

190
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:23,988
get hold of this device whenever
something is happening missus

191
00:11:23,989 --> 00:11:27,429
by the side report up in Scotland and

192
00:11:27,429 --> 00:11:30,929
so presumably the access code is there
to keep people from stealing

193
00:11:30,929 --> 00:11:33,779
right but it's like the security people
on the safety people haven't worked

194
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:34,309
together

195
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:37,540
they haven't thought about this in the
Battersea just have to post up

196
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,939
the access code on the top and I find
that really frustrating

197
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:44,860
safety people are intelligent
interesting people right security people

198
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:48,499
intelligent interesting people the kind
of at odds with each other all the time

199
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,339
because at this culture clash

200
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,470
and I don't think the culture clash
actually exists it's just that the

201
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,470
technologies that will put in place

202
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,110
have been put in place without
communication between the two sides of

203
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:58,860
the equation

204
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,059
and they've been encouraged to think
about it this way because the features

205
00:12:02,059 --> 00:12:03,199
of these devices

206
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,569
don't support safety the way it needs to
be so as as a good example of this

207
00:12:07,569 --> 00:12:11,238
do we need an access code on this at all
an access code is actually completely

208
00:12:11,239 --> 00:12:14,470
ridiculous the whole point of this
device is that it's available to you

209
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:18,360
in an emergency so the access code is
getting in the way

210
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,239
being used quickly right so maybe we
should be focusing on this particular

211
00:12:22,239 --> 00:12:23,600
case is logging

212
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:27,100
detection it's a response and maybe even
some sort tracking device

213
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,749
so someone does deal that you can try
and recover it or even just CCTV

214
00:12:30,749 --> 00:12:34,549
putting a CCTV camera over this so if
someone uses it for their own purposes

215
00:12:34,549 --> 00:12:38,669
you can record the event and reports the
police or do something and this is my

216
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:39,040
point

217
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:43,189
like this this post like autumn Eve
safety versus security needs to stop

218
00:12:43,189 --> 00:12:47,569
and we need to come to collaborate in
this sense

219
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,510
so one of my favorite concepts as
passive safety

220
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,310
in 90 everyone in here has spent
hundreds of hours working with them

221
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:58,319
liquid fluoride thorium reactors and

222
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,930
I myself have also logs 0 hours on one
of these reactors

223
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:05,650
but I was I was given this as an example
like as I was told to read up on these

224
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:06,189
by

225
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:09,530
mentor of mine and and he said to me
that

226
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:13,010
you know one of the interesting things a
in these reactors is the sense of

227
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,080
passive safety

228
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,350
right so on the reacting

229
00:13:17,350 --> 00:13:20,660
vessel and the salts that are reacting
with each other

230
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,319
decay naturally and stop reacting on
their own and

231
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,650
which is very useful because you have to
maintain the reaction to keep things

232
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:28,050
going

233
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:31,560
but the main thing is that has a freeze
plug in the bottom %uh this reactor

234
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,920
you have to apply energy to this freeze
plug you have to continually cool this

235
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,670
freeze plug

236
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,420
and if you don't if you don't apply
energy then

237
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:43,740
it sorted melts away and everything
drains into a heatsink

238
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:48,560
and drainage sank underneath the reactor
and the reactions or slows all on its

239
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,000
own

240
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,240
and everything decays to a safe stay I'm

241
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,900
and I find this really really
interesting fascinating

242
00:13:55,900 --> 00:14:00,579
principal if you apply energy or apply X
continually to this thing

243
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:05,000
then when it does fail it fails into a
safe stay

244
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,100
and I'm kinda curious will be possible
to use this

245
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:13,430
passive safety concept in a security
sense can continually apply

246
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:18,329
some cryptographic principal and when
the system fails it fails safely and it

247
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,260
fails securely

248
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,620
I'm not sure but that's why I'm talking
to people

249
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:26,210
your filled with tears and you're here
for him at camp for exactly that reason

250
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:31,410
so colonel attestation

251
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:35,550
right this is one of the things we could
use in industrial systems where

252
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:39,780
the kernel continually attests to the
fact that has been altered

253
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,470
and a certain properties are maintained
when the big problems with this in

254
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:45,230
practice is the massive overhead

255
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:48,840
messages the constant sending messages
back and forth across a network

256
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:52,510
and sometimes I would violate are real
time constraints for example

257
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:56,480
and but still interesting idea and I
feel it's just pushing on to the edges

258
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,930
that

259
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:57,300
pass

260
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,620
safety passive security kinda I'm
concept

261
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,000
will become with patching because the
safety problems that we discussed

262
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,810
earlier in the industrial systems world

263
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:10,380
I know for for a fact having studied

264
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:13,880
a bunch of the system's and reading
other people's my papers on the subject

265
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:17,150
they can take 18 months before they even
want to apply

266
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,400
a security patch to some of these
devices including

267
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,400
Windows NT and Windows XP machines for

268
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:27,990
not only that its 18 months before they
start the process

269
00:15:27,990 --> 00:15:31,210
and then sometimes six months to get
people work in order to actually be able

270
00:15:31,210 --> 00:15:32,470
to apply the patches

271
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:35,640
I'm I found a number I'll

272
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:38,710
you know zero-day vulnerabilities in
industry's net

273
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:43,400
devices many switches like I say that my
passion the moment mostly cuz PLC's in

274
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,540
our teas and so on the card

275
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,140
done but my point is whenever I find
those I go through according to

276
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:51,010
disclosure process which is very painful
I can assure you

277
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,160
and even once I've got the passion place
with a vendor

278
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:58,490
which you know takes three to six months
I can be pretty certain that when I go

279
00:15:58,490 --> 00:16:00,060
to Japan tests on these devices

280
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,890
are still be able to use the
vulnerabilities I found for another two

281
00:16:02,890 --> 00:16:03,460
years

282
00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:07,840
right because it takes that long to roll
the patches so I'd like to move towards

283
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,380
a model a continual patching

284
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:13,460
you know certainly within the next
machine on most occasions you can up

285
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:18,120
update you know all your sources bring
in other new code and the security

286
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:18,750
updates

287
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,590
and you not to reboot your machine every
time media right so I find it a bit

288
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,130
ridiculous that we can do that

289
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:27,620
with an ex machina that the you know
these other devices are using embedded

290
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:28,990
Linux most the time

291
00:16:28,990 --> 00:16:31,360
and somehow they need to reboot every
time you

292
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,560
apply some patterns so maybe we can move
past that right

293
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,540
firmware checking cryptographic checking
a firmwares it's okay when you find it I

294
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,680
very rarely find it but when you do find
it is typically

295
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,079
a cryptographic checks on essentially
hash

296
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:48,200
right and so that hashes checked when
the device

297
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:51,290
boots up I if you're lucky or when the

298
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:55,290
update is rolled up but is not
necessarily checked the rest the time so

299
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:56,170
you have to do is

300
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:59,770
play with the time I checked I might use
the talk to you up there so

301
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:03,860
I make sure that when the firmwares is
booted up it hashes correctly

302
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,940
and then afterwards I switch the
firmware and it runs

303
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:11,820
you know whatever I want right and so
we'd like to move away from that sort of

304
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:12,560
model

305
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,210
a a firmer integrity and detection a
response

306
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,460
i think is more useful in some ways then
focusing on the for months

307
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,950
and the idea of sensor fusion with trust
levels

308
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:29,210
okay I'll come back to a little bit
later okay

309
00:17:29,210 --> 00:17:33,170
so the review study in this field I
advise you take a picture this now these

310
00:17:33,170 --> 00:17:34,260
the protocols you get

311
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:39,640
have a chance to look at these are
mostly on authenticator protocols and

312
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,860
most the protocols without

313
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:44,219
any integrity and which is really
disturbing because

314
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:48,780
this is controlling your industrial
infrastructure gonna come up

315
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:53,780
find out for yourself you don't need to
be a hacker to check out on your own we

316
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,710
have real time constraints in the
system's

317
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:59,780
I am what I mean by that is a message
might need to get from and device to

318
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:03,810
another in milliseconds or microseconds
to guarantee some safety condition

319
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:06,830
this makes the Qatar goofy in this
environment very very difficult

320
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:10,889
because we have to do the cryptographic
computations within that time scale

321
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:13,970
and and also we usually have some

322
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,760
you know resource constraints memory
processing and should be in random

323
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:18,690
number generation

324
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,250
these kinds of problems and key
management

325
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:27,560
is also a nightmare other thing I find
most often these days is hardcoded

326
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,850
cryptographic credentials

327
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:33,040
whether they're used for SSH SSL and
there's a big

328
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:36,320
and movements Rapti alas RSL around

329
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,129
every industrial system protocol which
means all these different devices need

330
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,110
to have different easily need to manage
them how do you do that a real time

331
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:43,639
sense

332
00:18:43,639 --> 00:18:46,750
it's quite a challenging problem if
you're interested in photography

333
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:51,029
you can go that direction and study some
other okay

334
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:54,110
I think threshold cryptography is far
more interesting

335
00:18:54,110 --> 00:18:57,979
same here note is your knowledge porfas
exit one

336
00:18:57,980 --> 00:19:01,070
perfect to their knowledge for now

337
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:04,710
bring okay sow's ear nose proof I'm

338
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:08,730
I think the really interesting that the
basic idea is let's say I know something

339
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:13,470
and I want to prove to you that I know
this thing but I don't want to reveal to

340
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:17,580
you the thing that I'm prove it this is
the simplest example I could find my

341
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,620
favorite personal example involves

342
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:23,408
the graph 3 coloring problem and proving
the isomorphism at the graph

343
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:27,299
or the solution for the graph but let's
just stick to the simple one for the

344
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:27,730
moment

345
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:30,909
and let's say Alice

346
00:19:30,909 --> 00:19:34,029
has two cops and wants to claim that
they both contain the same manner

347
00:19:34,029 --> 00:19:34,700
marbles

348
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:37,990
and the Bob wants to verify this and

349
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:41,559
then house can offer two buckets that
also contained a number models

350
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:46,250
and Bob can choose which cop gets poured
into which bucket right

351
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:50,340
and then Bob can count both buckets and
make sure they both match

352
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:53,779
and in the process of choosing which cup
goes into which bucket

353
00:19:53,779 --> 00:19:57,700
if we assume that they were different
and not actually is and the house is

354
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:58,720
lying to us

355
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:03,659
then and that Alice it sorta rigged the
buckets down below us that they would

356
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:04,529
match up

357
00:20:04,529 --> 00:20:07,909
then there's a 50 percent chance of him
having chosen along packets are not

358
00:20:07,909 --> 00:20:08,710
coming out alright

359
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:12,370
so I don't if you can see this down here
the bottom up step 3:

360
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:16,590
buchanan fifty percent confidence for
the first game 75 percent confidence for

361
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,399
the second game

362
00:20:17,399 --> 00:20:21,000
and ninety-five percent complicit after
the fifth game that they do indeed

363
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,379
contain the same models

364
00:20:22,379 --> 00:20:26,340
so this is loosely speaking how
interactive zero-knowledge proof systems

365
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,408
work and my argument is that you can
embed this into some other industrial

366
00:20:30,409 --> 00:20:31,519
systems protocols

367
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:35,399
because the first five messages that are
exchanged industrial system protocol are

368
00:20:35,399 --> 00:20:39,168
not usually that important and so the
sessions are maintained for years at a

369
00:20:39,169 --> 00:20:39,740
time

370
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,509
so you would slowly building confidence
in you would only perform sensitive

371
00:20:43,509 --> 00:20:44,389
operations

372
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:47,850
once you had built confidence to a level
that you're comfortable with

373
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,340
so far I haven't seen many people
explore this idea some encouraging you

374
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:54,139
think about it and

375
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,710
in a presentation about six months ago I
asked the vendors at the system's

376
00:20:57,710 --> 00:21:00,740
if they would commit to a six-month
average patch time

377
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,480
and I specify average because some bugs
are really sore knee in really difficult

378
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:08,600
and ask them if I come to you as an
outsider and I produce

379
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,709
you know something I consider to be
failure in security terms earned exploit

380
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:13,750
frontier products

381
00:21:13,750 --> 00:21:17,210
will you patch within six months and
this is the response like up

382
00:21:17,210 --> 00:21:20,440
in fact I didn't even make this picture
this is this is the fam picture sent to

383
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,789
me after that presentation

384
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:24,850
and if you wanna see the video there's a
nice awkward

385
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:28,750
two-minute silence after I asked that
question to six or seven

386
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,110
up the big companies who built the
system's okay

387
00:21:33,110 --> 00:21:36,668
so this is about what you can do and
must be very quickly through

388
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:39,980
some running at a time and what did you
do on the host scale you can do better

389
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,309
for my reputation

390
00:21:41,309 --> 00:21:44,700
and if you're interested in that sort of
thing here you can focus on a

391
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,909
non-disruptive patching technologies and
techniques

392
00:21:47,909 --> 00:21:51,450
in memory patching for example safe and
secure defaults

393
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:55,409
and I in fact I'm put formal methods
analysis in here but when the

394
00:21:55,409 --> 00:21:57,380
interesting things you can do with a
camel these days

395
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:00,960
is draw the model from the
implementation and then to you format is

396
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,450
revocation have the code

397
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:06,159
on his or a backwards way to make sure
that it's not going to violate your

398
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,250
safety constraints right and

399
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:11,799
built for Internet Security even though
theoretically this are always deployed

400
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:13,000
on private networks

401
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,370
I was home a little bit funny just like
I said earlier I rescued ten thousand

402
00:22:17,370 --> 00:22:20,580
from the internet as part my master's
thesis I'm

403
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:23,879
for some friends ex and supporting a
detection

404
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,240
technologies and service Ponson and
detection Technol some the network scale

405
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,740
does love protocol work to be done we
could be adding photography to these

406
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,110
protocols adding integrity do these
protocols

407
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:38,928
I am non replay is another important
cryptographic property that we want in

408
00:22:38,929 --> 00:22:39,510
this place

409
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,720
and also another thing that i think is
very interesting is there some

410
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:46,120
people doing sanity checking up the
process values to make sure they obey

411
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,959
the physics

412
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,340
and you know a vessel can't cued up
faster the

413
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:55,500
than the conviction rate the material
that is made from if it is you've

414
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,350
probably got us

415
00:22:56,350 --> 00:22:57,800
you know sensor air

416
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,490
so you can do a lot of interesting work
verifying

417
00:23:00,490 --> 00:23:04,100
the processed data itself without doing
any Qathafi

418
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:07,520
at all at the system scale

419
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,200
and I would say we could do with some
experiments with engineers

420
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,710
understanding of trust remember earlier
I was talking about threshold

421
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:14,440
photography

422
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,520
and fusion of sensor values and their
trust relationship

423
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:21,660
what happens if you have some sensor
values come from this field over here

424
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,309
that have no

425
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:25,440
cryptographic integrity and you have
some other from over here that

426
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,400
the do how do you display those on the
screen to user to let them make

427
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,760
decisions and no

428
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:33,900
these might be false these are probably
accurate

429
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:37,470
I'm I think this an interesting
psychological research that could be

430
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:37,980
done there

431
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,520
without even this show the building
industrial system I'm use alarms anomaly

432
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,620
detection in concert with safety people

433
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:49,260
develop real time key management
strategies at the site scale

434
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,879
stop dividing safety and security people
put them together in a room and let them

435
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:54,710
actually get

436
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:58,080
requirements from the vendor to build
the system differently

437
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:01,350
so avoid this false dichotomy and really
ask the people

438
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:05,090
president why not you know what is the
safety properties you need to be sure

439
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,928
I have not been altered and what are the
security properties that need to be sure

440
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:12,870
I am are in place bonanza response plan

441
00:24:12,870 --> 00:24:16,780
test security doing factory acceptance
testing and side acceptance testing

442
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:19,940
right security requirements for the
vendors and get them to stick to them

443
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:23,550
and and then another thing I think
they'll be interesting for any of you

444
00:24:23,550 --> 00:24:26,800
just as citizens of the world who depend
on infrastructure

445
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,940
is to learn about five industrial system
security incident

446
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:34,950
I do another talk about 10 and ostracism
incidents that occur before Stuxnet

447
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:38,270
haven't touched my successor known talks
whether the bombing attacks occurred

448
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,010
before that and there's over 200 of them
in a database

449
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,059
so these things do happen and we should
prepare as a society forum

450
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,420
at the nation's scale examined showed on
results from on a roll critical national

451
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,350
infrastructure like so that was my
thesis

452
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:55,129
very effective people are continuing
that work to this day I was great for me

453
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:56,470
cuz I can go in the other things

454
00:24:56,470 --> 00:25:00,040
study the falling cost to finding these
vulnerable systems and participate with

455
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:00,960
some of these other

456
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:04,580
organizations such as a Nissan

457
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:07,870
and here in the rest the world's if
you're kinda post nationalist like

458
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:08,459
myself

459
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:12,180
and you know respond to reports about
the country's about attackers coming

460
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,910
from your country

461
00:25:12,910 --> 00:25:16,600
run honey pots and catch madness and
just generally do research and try and

462
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,149
help us out

463
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:22,130
I'm is your infrastructure regardless of
whether your interest in Qatar graffiti

464
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:24,240
or industrial systems or anything else

465
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:27,550
at City agitate agitate asked the
board's

466
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:31,570
what they're doing about security and
reduce your own infrastructure that's

467
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,340
consider

468
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,020
you know there's people talked about
making a 300-watt

469
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:39,360
wind generators which is very much it's
like a couple laptops in your phone and

470
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,149
some other stuff but

471
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:43,220
you know that they're gonna build them
from 3d printers and you can fit them in

472
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:43,960
your backpack

473
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,900
why not experiments on these tools and
and reduce your own infrastructure debt

474
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,450
and the main thing here DMF invents a
decentralized

475
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:55,450
a microgrid micro infrastructure tools

476
00:25:55,450 --> 00:25:58,560
and disruptive technologies and I guess

477
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,600
it's about time we get back to this so
many eleven people

478
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:08,600
could have 11 volunteers

479
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:25,320
okay really wanted you mind remembered

480
00:26:25,419 --> 00:26:32,419
mister I'm I'm him

481
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:41,210
them

482
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:50,359
yet

483
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,689
now

484
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:56,429
was this deck of cards altered during to
talk today one walk up and change the

485
00:26:56,429 --> 00:26:57,190
deck of cards

486
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:03,850
they might have been I which is my proof
entirely right

487
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:08,289
let's see if I can actually do this and
everyone holder cards ths

488
00:27:08,289 --> 00:27:13,110
think about your card me see if I can
get all these and then go have a beer

489
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:18,049
and admit this point the performance I
sometimes wonder what would happen if I

490
00:27:18,049 --> 00:27:19,039
didn't get these

491
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,129
but just a thought and if i name your
card

492
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:28,770
police said the card back on the DAC and
walk back into the audience

493
00:27:28,770 --> 00:27:32,389
let's see here the ten of clubs

494
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:37,620
the and %uh this is interesting we've
got some sevens

495
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,789
a.m. who got the 70 hearts

496
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:44,270
seven of spades 7 a diamonds

497
00:27:44,270 --> 00:27:47,710
to have clubs Acer hearts

498
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:51,860
I am not see the

499
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:55,580
five states

500
00:27:55,580 --> 00:28:00,549
and the three have diamonds

501
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:04,658
the 60 clubs I am

502
00:28:04,659 --> 00:28:11,659
three parts and v8 OHV States

503
00:28:16,999 --> 00:28:20,049
thank you I hope you enjoyed this talk I
know as a random

504
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,960
if you're interested me subjects and you
want to get down into the deep technical

505
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:23,749
details

506
00:28:23,749 --> 00:28:27,820
I have some firmware files absentee caps
come find me in some the other hackers

507
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:30,299
and we can talk about industrial control
system security

508
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:33,320
and I'm I hope you enjoy the moustache I
certainly do
