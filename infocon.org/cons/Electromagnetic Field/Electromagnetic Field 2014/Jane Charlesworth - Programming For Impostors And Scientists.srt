1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,850
hi I M

2
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:15,379
I I don't know people expecting this is
kinda going to Iran

3
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,730
and a bit personal I am and opinionated
and

4
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:23,410
I've tried to put some slides together
ice struggle to illustrate some things I

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:24,850
want to try and stay safe

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:28,800
if you bear with me that would be great
am our

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,460
just since I was a little bit about my
background because a person whether

8
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:35,450
scientists come in lots of different
flavors impostors coming not too

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:36,150
different flavors

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:39,580
might be talking about something that
specific I'm a biologist

11
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,890
I didn't spend my teenagers programming
a statement childhood playing under

12
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,620
trucks in

13
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:47,680
buxom things like that ands

14
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,729
ham I did I did a biology degree

15
00:00:50,729 --> 00:00:55,879
I liked maps and computers at school but
I didn't endorse my free time on it I'm

16
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:59,860
and I did a biology degree and then went
on to do a PhD

17
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,870
in and compete area computational
biology

18
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,500
and for various reasons and it up kinda
feeling workers struggling in on the

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,080
back foot

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,929
with the sort programming pewter side
things mostly because I didn't have any

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,370
training in that area at all

22
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,880
side thats background and going to be
talking for

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,780
about and maybe some other problems I
think them

24
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,780
the might be in academia and education
and

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,100
and some things I think we could dish
maybe so those things out

26
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,369
and some people that helped me other
people might find useful so there you go

27
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:40,369
I'm

28
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,170
okay

29
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:51,580
and I see a pic K

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:55,120
said being signed to the practice is Gus
said

31
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,390
this is the amount code

32
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:03,240
idea and the amount of training I had
sided training program has a primary

33
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:03,860
still

34
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:07,370
tortoise 100 something we did for a
couple weeks went way can we just type

35
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,170
instructions are to make basic

36
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:13,839
games that was kinda fun I started a PhD

37
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,570
and the first thing my supervisor said
was right intimacy

38
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:21,260
this evolution a model in Mathematica
and then he left

39
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:24,380
three weeks and that was it fairly
daunting task

40
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:28,630
and that made me feel like maybe I
shouldn't be doing a PhD

41
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:32,290
because if I was expected to know how to
dual these things

42
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:36,700
then maybe I was in the wrong place and
so that's what imposter past the stock

43
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,310
comes from because of Ramadan feeling
like that's a little bit

44
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:44,550
I'm a filibuster struggling to learn a
lot of things struggling to catch up

45
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,670
not sure where to even start a lot of
the time and

46
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:51,790
from talking to other people I work with
the for quite a few feel the same way

47
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:52,350
which is

48
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:55,870
my motivation here so have again had a
student

49
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,760
two-week panel course I sat in on that
was part of I

50
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,149
somebody's computer science master's
course that they were doing when I was

51
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,620
in my PhD and

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,390
and virtually the same basics like
produce a basic concepts that

53
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,458
so that that wasn't very helpful with

54
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:16,000
saturday today believe something to
stick say

55
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,150
unknown to you per second

56
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:23,040
again hasn't really been any training
and I think computer-related

57
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,079
even though basically I'm in front of a
computer eight hours a day left engine

58
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,959
tinkered Inc sir says

59
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:33,549
so

60
00:03:33,549 --> 00:03:37,329
this is again so how much of an imposter
I felt

61
00:03:37,329 --> 00:03:41,680
can times I feel like me back and I had
to do something then why

62
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,090
it's all that all that much and I feel
like if we shouldn't

63
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,440
be there because everyone seems to know
things and I don't

64
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:53,690
and people people make comments like
you're really smart she should know how

65
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,549
to do this

66
00:03:54,549 --> 00:03:58,290
and those who did make this humans being
an impostor West some because you're

67
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:00,030
really smart you should know how to do
this thing

68
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,190
you've never done before and a my trench
and future except into dealing States

69
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:05,780
people

70
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,370
because I think their own her

71
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:14,329
so yet again trying to illustrate this
what it feels like is

72
00:04:14,329 --> 00:04:18,228
I can do very little everyone else can
do an awful lot and

73
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:23,400
here on the right here is my neighbors
sinking narrowboat

74
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,120
so I feel like a sinking boat I feel
like I'm gradually going under I

75
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,220
all the time I feel like they're more
things and should know how to do it

76
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,120
and it's like a constant race like this
the metaphor for

77
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,070
doc way it looks like it's alright but
under the water its kinda doing this

78
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,930
with swimming thing

79
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,949
sir just runs in the streets in a couple
device

80
00:04:43,949 --> 00:04:47,240
their am but this is how

81
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,560
this is how I want to feel how I want my
students to feel accused as I'm even

82
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,360
with being scientists like getting super
by some students I don't want them to go

83
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,020
through the same

84
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,639
sad feeling sick I did I want my
students to learn things and feel

85
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,169
confident about many things

86
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:05,460
I want them to know that maybe they can
do something

87
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:08,380
other people could do something else but
there's a common ground we can all learn

88
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:15,379
from each other

89
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:15,909
and

90
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:19,969
in the in the person doing science what
we're trying to do ultimately a

91
00:05:19,969 --> 00:05:21,029
scientist's

92
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,629
in the system that we work with and is
produced papers and produce research

93
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:28,719
and supervisor have want that to happen
as quickly as possible

94
00:05:28,719 --> 00:05:31,939
but if you don't have the skills to do
that well

95
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:36,109
it might happen it might not be very
good it might not happen as quickly as

96
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:36,839
they would like

97
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:40,009
ans it seems like its consummation

98
00:05:40,009 --> 00:05:43,579
to get to producing papers but

99
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:47,759
what I want argues it's actually spends
time learning the skills

100
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,349
you need to do the research whether
their skills on future or skills in the

101
00:05:51,349 --> 00:05:51,769
lab

102
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:55,349
you'll actually gets the paper so the
paper writing state of things

103
00:05:55,349 --> 00:06:00,099
a lot faster and produce something a lot
better so I won't argue that taking time

104
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:04,239
to build skills and to teach your
students skills

105
00:06:04,239 --> 00:06:08,619
is really important in this whole
process is doing science

106
00:06:08,619 --> 00:06:14,580
so

107
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,258
again people may think we face a crisis
in biology education to my background is

108
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:20,250
filed yet can't speak for other sciences

109
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:24,080
but my degree was very non computational
and very non quantitative and I think

110
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,460
this is a massive problem

111
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:30,188
sided my degree round about the fact I'm
fest human genome sequence is published

112
00:06:30,189 --> 00:06:36,449
since then thousands genome sequences a
different organisms has been published

113
00:06:36,449 --> 00:06:40,889
we have an absolute honour data we need
people to analyze that data

114
00:06:40,889 --> 00:06:44,699
how do you do that you do not use the
computers you need to know how to use

115
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:45,060
them

116
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:51,849
I don't know with spliced others

117
00:06:51,849 --> 00:06:55,190
other sciences I can speak to the
background I work with then

118
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:02,190
so sometimes they don't get Stephens

119
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,279
so again China sure the development of
DNA sequencing technologies such as

120
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:10,490
massively jump to

121
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:14,650
and the last couple of years vast amount
of data being produced

122
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,818
and we need people to handle that but

123
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:23,719
it seems kind of like a moment that
hasn't fully appreciate it so I went

124
00:07:23,719 --> 00:07:25,800
back and looked at the degree content of
the degree

125
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:30,360
I did ten years on and it's exactly the
same there is still no programming

126
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,469
course for biologists there's a very
basic math scores

127
00:07:33,469 --> 00:07:37,610
that you didn't need to do if you got to
see at I thinks

128
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:40,870
higher for a level and that is

129
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:46,110
it hasn't changed and just to verify
that I talk to people at the Investor I

130
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:46,719
went to

131
00:07:46,719 --> 00:07:49,740
haven't changed I looked actually

132
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,830
biology degree at Oxford which is why
work now and it looks pretty similar

133
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:57,539
people I know who are teaching say that
maths and computing

134
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,659
iraq major bottleneck for the
undergraduates at their teaching they're

135
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:02,500
really concerned that they don't
necessarily

136
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:06,270
have the skills to teach the students
but I think the students need them if

137
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:07,839
they want to go into research

138
00:08:07,839 --> 00:08:11,279
certain moment undoing poster I work in
the lab

139
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,949
with bunch of people ranging from medics
who are actually doing clinical stuff to

140
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:17,080
statisticians

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,919
even the medics want to learn to code
the medics come in my office ago can you

142
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,880
show me some basic basic Python

143
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:24,909
because this will help me

144
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:28,729
did the research know what to do some
people really appreciate that this is it

145
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:29,659
this kind of like

146
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:33,779
a need to learn the skills but we don't
necessarily always know how

147
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:38,439
and some people im very afraid some
people very afraid if the idea of

148
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:40,599
sitting down in front of a computer in
playing around

149
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,399
because it's something that they haven't
done if they're medic

150
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,459
they haven't done that they don't they
don't know where to stop

151
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:52,469
come though your first month's data

152
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,760
in biology at one we want to work with
again I tried to look up what was

153
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,760
in an undergraduate degree course I'm
doing

154
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,939
a little bit research from hours with a
three-set I could find to buy

155
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,970
informatics

156
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,200
BSC courses one mention if

157
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,750
across undergraduate computational
biology that was

158
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:16,220
in the process is being planned and
might degree had to each entry to find

159
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:19,740
Matix it didn't involve any programming
I'm just using some

160
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:25,920
basic software tools against

161
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:29,620
somebody's published a paper actually
looking into this only interviewed

162
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:33,260
a whopping at 937 ecology researchers

163
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:36,300
and 75 percent to those people felt that
their

164
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:39,719
degrees were lucky in maths computing
content

165
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,620
interestingly if you look at these blue
bars

166
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,600
showing whether they were satisfied with
them a understanding in the paper they

167
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,279
include computers him as well it's only

168
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,570
few people who are actually trained
mathematicians say yes i'm happy with

169
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,420
how much must sign

170
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,269
which has convinced think and

171
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:05,699
and here's a quote from one of the
people that they interviewed here

172
00:10:05,699 --> 00:10:06,660
whether saying that

173
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:11,339
with given the nature of our field even
though we work with specialists

174
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:15,610
who implement maths and computing stuff
for us we actually want to understand

175
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:16,560
what's going on

176
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:22,510
and its taking a me months focusing on
statistics mathematics models just to

177
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,149
get up speak to the fundamentals and we
should be given during undergrad

178
00:10:26,149 --> 00:10:30,120
so I think there's a need to improve and
improve this I'm not really sure

179
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,050
necessarily how to to do that

180
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,880
I just kind of wanted to get up and run
to doctor in case

181
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,390
anyone had better ideas than I did

182
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:45,300
its intention to ask what can we

183
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,978
maybe what can we maybe do about this

184
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:53,709
within the constraints the system
wherein his are things about us on the

185
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:57,018
whole science academia system that I
would really like to change

186
00:10:57,019 --> 00:11:01,379
am and I think one of the things that
can lead to feeling like

187
00:11:01,379 --> 00:11:05,129
you are imposters kinda in built in the
academic system this is

188
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:09,470
pressure to be smart people say you're
smart you should be able to do this

189
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,259
and maybe you are smart but maybe at
times you don't feel like you're smart

190
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,179
maybe

191
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:20,419
you are somebody who find it really hard
to speak up in a room full of people

192
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:23,589
you might find it really hard to ask for
help when you're struggling

193
00:11:23,589 --> 00:11:26,629
I think it's kinda moms am

194
00:11:26,629 --> 00:11:31,489
supervisors to work hard on building a a
better dialogue with students to try and

195
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:32,759
identify those needs

196
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:35,779
sometimes because people may not speak
up about things

197
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:39,309
if you're feeling like you're on the
back foot if you feeling like

198
00:11:39,309 --> 00:11:43,649
imposter its those feelings can be
really hard to get over

199
00:11:43,649 --> 00:11:48,479
so again

200
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:53,079
what I want is for everyone to feel like

201
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:56,238
they have some skills other people may
have skills but

202
00:11:56,239 --> 00:12:01,099
that's actually not really a problem
that you don't know things

203
00:12:01,099 --> 00:12:07,859
those are things that you can you can
learn at the moment there seems to be

204
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:09,309
lots of really short courses

205
00:12:09,309 --> 00:12:12,889
that an office sometimes people were
further along their

206
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,039
degree in again I'm going to act right
neighbors but with this metaphor

207
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:20,079
so that both was sinking in the festive
treasured actually some

208
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,008
completely to the bottom of the river on

209
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:27,470
the owners response to this was as
follows:

210
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,659
they come to town it sunk again

211
00:12:30,659 --> 00:12:35,319
they pumped it out again and eventually
worked out that by standing there

212
00:12:35,319 --> 00:12:36,858
continuously pumping the water

213
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:41,649
out they could just about keep it
floating am

214
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,809
at no point does it seem to catch this
person

215
00:12:44,809 --> 00:12:48,579
maybe they should try and find the whole
this is letting the water in and fix

216
00:12:48,579 --> 00:12:50,489
that

217
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:52,949
perhaps they don't have the money or the
resources to do so

218
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:56,349
but they seem they seem to be reluctant

219
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:59,660
to to try different solutions

220
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,839
and because is about pollution do it
with water lots of people trying to give

221
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:04,930
them advice

222
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:09,430
analyst this city struck me as a useful
metaphor for maybe there things in the

223
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:10,750
system that we could try and

224
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,759
and change or that I would like to try
and

225
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,920
change so

226
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:20,610
here's an illustration based on

227
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:24,680
talking to people in my group about
something attitudes to

228
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:27,810
computers and some other things that
people have said to them

229
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:31,130
and that have been but helpful or

230
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:38,130
less helpful um so on the left is the
supervisor who

231
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,939
maybe had no training in in
computational stuff themselves

232
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:45,220
the has learned stuff because they've
been doing it for fifteen or twenty

233
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:45,880
years

234
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:49,069
know the propeller scars on the manatee
this is the

235
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:53,910
this is a key feature of this diagram
this manatee has learned through pain

236
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:58,620
what they tend to say to the student is
your smart

237
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,949
can figure this out on your own it
should only take you a day or so

238
00:14:01,949 --> 00:14:06,300
that can translate to sell I found that
translates to several different things

239
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:10,109
often with my supervisors at his I have
no idea how to do this thing please

240
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,439
figure it out for me

241
00:14:11,439 --> 00:14:16,089
sometimes it's I figured out how to do
this thing through pain

242
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:19,579
and you should do the same thing because
that makes you actually learn

243
00:14:19,579 --> 00:14:26,579
you'll learn if you have to do it to
pain on the other hand

244
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,350
some supervisors will go yeah it's
really hard it took me ages 11 to 12

245
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:31,870
look it up

246
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:35,620
what I've done how can I help you out
let's talk about this

247
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:38,720
a look you can do this there if you can
do this that then you can figure out

248
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,860
this other thing and

249
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:43,640
I think the technical term for this in
teaching a scaffolding

250
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:47,569
so giving somebody that's something to
do that is challenging

251
00:14:47,570 --> 00:14:52,210
but not so challenging that they don't
even know where to begin with that ans

252
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,920
I think that if we want to train people
as researchers

253
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,290
that's the approach that we need in
building all kinds of skills as

254
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,589
build them up gradually start small
work-up

255
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:05,650
I'm to bigger tasks

256
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,530
building on what people already know
work out what people know start with %uh

257
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,209
with the medics and I work with you're
interested in programming

258
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:16,780
they don't they've some other trying to
do courses

259
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:20,459
and they just go I don't it doesn't
stick in my head what does actually seem

260
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,620
to stick with them is

261
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:25,330
figure now a problem that they want to
solve and working with them to solve

262
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,900
that particular problem

263
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:29,870
find the thing that they're interested
in and then they actually enjoy the

264
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,670
skills they need to learn how to do it

265
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,890
this is this is probably a PSA and Anna

266
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:41,890
ham

267
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:43,829
since

268
00:15:43,829 --> 00:15:47,508
it and when I looked into this is a side
effects or growth mindset

269
00:15:47,509 --> 00:15:51,369
and I think often academia there's a
tendency to have the side effects

270
00:15:51,369 --> 00:15:54,489
mindset of young people is being smart
and the some

271
00:15:54,489 --> 00:15:57,859
and some other cultures I've been around
people people to your smart

272
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:01,499
and if you're told that your smile and
then suddenly find something that you

273
00:16:01,499 --> 00:16:02,169
can't

274
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,399
do this is kinda a weird cognitive
dissonance

275
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,600
because this destroys almost party just
a conception of yourself

276
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:15,129
if you go I'm slot that this I can't do
this thing I've been told a simple

277
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:18,389
suddenly feel very stupid and

278
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:22,249
your ways of learning may not be

279
00:16:22,249 --> 00:16:26,100
necessarily the right ways of learning
to get him that

280
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:29,799
if you're not used to failure because
you used to feeling smug use a funny

281
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:30,639
things easy

282
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,699
the money trying to do something like
programming which is actually

283
00:16:33,699 --> 00:16:36,889
about failure imparted fundamental way

284
00:16:36,889 --> 00:16:41,999
you you may end up struggling this

285
00:16:41,999 --> 00:16:45,759
at least in my experience might agree
with a lot of learning stuff from books

286
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:49,629
and writing essays and doing things
various tasks that

287
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:52,939
when thats quite such a problem solving
nature

288
00:16:52,939 --> 00:16:57,319
and thats one with I personally found

289
00:16:57,319 --> 00:17:02,399
ice ice I struggled with was doing it
ask where I'm going to fail

290
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:06,128
and I think if somebody told me that
before started doing stuff on the

291
00:17:06,128 --> 00:17:06,958
computer that would

292
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,669
probably helped

293
00:17:10,669 --> 00:17:12,929
but this in fact is the idea that you
your

294
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:17,620
ability isn't fixed and that you can you
can fill

295
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,428
and you can learn from failing and then
even fail again and you can do better

296
00:17:21,429 --> 00:17:24,880
and then you can learn the site which is
a

297
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,079
the one on the night the growth mindset
come

298
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:32,440
I think that actually much more useful

299
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,559
mindset to have a new learning any
complex task

300
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:39,520
and I think you see present students
that is the one that you really want to

301
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,870
encourage I also think the scientists

302
00:17:43,870 --> 00:17:47,570
may not be software developers we have
very different

303
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:51,100
backgrounds and so we don't

304
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,770
needs to write code that is beautiful
however

305
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:59,700
however

306
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:03,669
a lot of the code that biologists right
and that comes into published papers is

307
00:18:03,669 --> 00:18:03,919
a

308
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:07,360
the nature this was analyzed with an
in-house perl script

309
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:11,289
and there's no fit the description that
I want government presented her

310
00:18:11,289 --> 00:18:16,549
in-house are scrapped from somebody in
my grip

311
00:18:16,549 --> 00:18:20,639
and an example of how I think learning
some skills can do it better

312
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,120
so trying to prepare something for
presentation

313
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:28,320
my boss sent me this here's a script you
ask for

314
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,918
I run it once last year I think it
worked I don't remember what it all does

315
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:37,070
a starts with a comment and a great

316
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:40,439
this goes home unit does actually

317
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:47,440
the comment is probably from something
else and completely irrelevant

318
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,178
it says Rita tree choice to be to file

319
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:55,350
bets actually on this person's desktop
machine

320
00:18:55,350 --> 00:18:58,770
in order to do the next step and

321
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:02,000
when you're on the sink doesn't ask for
tree s any kind arguments so you don't

322
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,539
realize until you look at the code

323
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:06,669
it then goes through a bunch of things

324
00:19:06,669 --> 00:19:11,130
where every every variable they've given
this TP or MTP

325
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:14,510
on it day it

326
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:18,360
can take a little while to work out what
they're talking about it then finishes

327
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,899
and produced some output and

328
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:25,130
looked completely confusing on

329
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:28,679
they said yet finished I yeah I don't
know what that is either

330
00:19:28,679 --> 00:19:31,980
and they couldn't find

331
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,280
the original scripted to take it out and
put into another one

332
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,730
and they said yeah I did that last year
amid at member

333
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:43,080
Sen I would argue that you can do better
than that

334
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:46,720
scientific ok maybe shitty to a software
developer

335
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,559
but this example I think illustrates how

336
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,139
it may be shitty it may make a software
engineer p

337
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,429
but it will get the science done and
will probably get the sites down again

338
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:58,679
in six months

339
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,960
so I think army we need a low-level

340
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:05,130
a skill been all the stuff that I
learned actually

341
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:09,400
speeds up the science makes reproducible
and thats I think that's really

342
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,419
important so

343
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:14,340
if you look at looking at this example I
can see on the screen I'm

344
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,059
but basically what's different about
this example to the previous one is your

345
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:18,850
comments

346
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:23,689
the comments tell you what's happening
there are variable names which describe

347
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,650
what is in them

348
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:30,190
and I'm if you go back to that one six
months later you would probably be able

349
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:30,850
to work out

350
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:34,379
relatively easily what it it it to us

351
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,059
so I think they're they're definitely
things week that scientists can in for

352
00:20:38,059 --> 00:20:41,210
but it's not aiming to be like a
software engineer because it i think is

353
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,620
a very different things

354
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:48,418
some so

355
00:20:48,419 --> 00:20:52,149
somebody produced what I thought was
really interested

356
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:56,059
I really helpful ladder what you could
be aiming for with scientific kurd

357
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:59,590
on the side in 100 shifted because it
actually stops %uh

358
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:03,889
a start at the top so described in the
publication

359
00:21:03,889 --> 00:21:08,649
so what is it what does it do the
reference implementation

360
00:21:08,649 --> 00:21:12,110
with some way you can download it you
can install it you can run it on your

361
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,750
own data

362
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:17,679
and you could maybe replicate their
results money use free on your own data

363
00:21:17,679 --> 00:21:21,379
including a pipeline modifier and reduce
computer

364
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:27,100
on these are so they designated I don't
necessarily completely approve

365
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:30,350
with with them because

366
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:33,360
they say this is normally required for
publication actually

367
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,529
many publications on the skeletal

368
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:40,309
so that isn't required for publication
back

369
00:21:40,309 --> 00:21:43,330
that first hour should be up the top
there

370
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:48,460
but the sustainability stuff i think is

371
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:52,570
is important and this is from a guy
could see tightest down he does by

372
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:53,570
informatics

373
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:59,019
and if your interested in steve told I
would check I would check them out

374
00:21:59,019 --> 00:22:04,399
I put a star in it um base American come
out with what I'm doing

375
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:07,570
I could I feel it's kids' continuous
learning process

376
00:22:07,570 --> 00:22:11,279
so some other things i thinkI social
scientists who focus on

377
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:15,299
handling large datasets at least my feel
that something that we

378
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:19,120
we're doing and a lot of people have
absolutely no clue about how to do

379
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,610
so we we're getting given computing
power that we don't know how to use

380
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:23,469
necessarily

381
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:28,230
on hands I think

382
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,389
this is am this is problematic

383
00:22:32,389 --> 00:22:36,120
so we have one shared severin my work

384
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,199
and we have people who will just load
load it up with this stuff

385
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,070
that would run for six months we have a
cluster and people will

386
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,299
run jobs on on the head node and I think
those things like

387
00:22:46,299 --> 00:22:50,039
I did a half an hour's worth trying
basic training would probably get rid of

388
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:53,259
issues that happen on a recurring basis

389
00:22:53,259 --> 00:22:57,929
I'm version control and coach sharing I
think that did not happen at all in the

390
00:22:57,929 --> 00:22:58,899
group that I work in

391
00:22:58,899 --> 00:23:03,000
and depicted on at the moment is
definitely the best for suffer some

392
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,509
people

393
00:23:04,509 --> 00:23:08,200
we have weak have issues with people
will like maeve a piece of software that

394
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,289
other people using

395
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:12,940
deleted changed to a different version
and

396
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,519
everything breaks twenty people are
doing I'm

397
00:23:16,519 --> 00:23:20,059
this version control something the
scientist American seem to be really

398
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:21,129
really resistant to

399
00:23:21,129 --> 00:23:24,580
I don't if anyone has ideas for how to
get over this

400
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:28,340
this barrier to the idea of using
version control for the scripts

401
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:32,668
you right and want to share with the
people please talk to me because my bus

402
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:37,340
just will not do it and and

403
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,149
people go I don't understand how to use
SVN think that somebody set up

404
00:23:41,149 --> 00:23:46,479
and they just will not do it and keeping
long sister

405
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,700
as well II I find really helpful

406
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:54,799
19 modular code I can you use on kind of
learned to fight such as

407
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,160
Center reusable functions

408
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,830
22 did finding using existing libraries

409
00:24:01,830 --> 00:24:05,428
one of my coworkers first trying to
completely rewrite

410
00:24:05,429 --> 00:24:08,760
something with price into open tab
delimited text files

411
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,460
and open satins formats DNA sequencing

412
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,260
doesn't Michael Bair price in which does
everything that she wanted to do

413
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:20,110
she just didn't know about it so this is
like the service level

414
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:23,260
wouldn't I'm talking about and this
person is a postdoc who has their own

415
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,620
funding to set up their own research
group select their greatest

416
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,159
a senior level I'm doing computational
biology

417
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:35,929
a name for reproducibility start small
and keep learning

418
00:24:35,929 --> 00:24:40,000
I I keep in frustration as a million
things I don't know and feeling like I'm

419
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:42,340
a total failure because I don't know a
lot of things

420
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:46,360
I'm kinda realizing that as long as I
keep learning something keep

421
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:47,879
implementing the things I do

422
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:51,380
I'm doing okay and

423
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,970
biology education should introduce
computing early teacher

424
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:59,160
repeatedly take my dad's old saying
through enough shit to do well in some

425
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:03,250
will stack I think learning is a lot
like that probably for most people I

426
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:03,880
noticed

427
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,470
it's like that to me I need a repeated
exposure to things in our district

428
00:25:07,470 --> 00:25:10,240
actually sink in and for me to feel
confident with using it

429
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,660
I think problem-solving based learning
is is

430
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,480
probably the wait way to go with stuff
lectures especially to computing some

431
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,560
I'm it doesn't stick me I'd it made if
other people

432
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,389
but I think I think that time and I
should start smiling keep shining again

433
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:30,970
sorry am and lastly

434
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:35,020
this is the one thing I wish somebody
had taught me about programming before I

435
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:35,790
started

436
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,580
I think my feelings programming I'm a
lot like

437
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:42,649
as if I was fighting a large Snell with
the small stick

438
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:48,300
unfailingly time maybe eighty percent of
what I do is wrong and failing

439
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:52,070
and for the longest time that made me
feel like I was the one

440
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:55,439
is failing and then I talked to some
people who are suffering jim is and I

441
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,690
talked to people who was with the

442
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:00,020
cleverest computer science people that I
know and the like

443
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,190
it's like that for me to I'm not kinda

444
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,280
popped the balloon feeling like I was a
total failure

445
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:10,290
I N I want to spend the read about that

446
00:26:10,290 --> 00:26:14,920
probably a few failing it's because
you're doing something hard and

447
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:18,110
talk to be to talk to people

448
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:22,340
ask questions because yarn you're not
alone in feeling that way

449
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:25,730
am

450
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,080
and finally I just want to share a
couple three

451
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:33,939
resources I found been really helpful
I'm

452
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:37,390
this is a Google software sustainability
Institute I'm

453
00:26:37,390 --> 00:26:41,210
I think a couple to conferences talk to
people there aim is to improve research

454
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:42,080
software

455
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,669
their slogan is better software better
research on

456
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:50,320
they run conferences and do stuff like
bringing together suspension isn't

457
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,600
scientists talking about issues in SA

458
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,300
research software and training and I
found a really helpful

459
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:01,780
and they put me in touch is a great cook
supper carpentry to

460
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:05,610
troutman a two-day training boot camp
thing for my career

461
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:10,790
which I'm in the process of doing that's
it

462
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:17,790
thanks

463
00:27:26,689 --> 00:27:29,709
hi I I work in academia

464
00:27:29,709 --> 00:27:33,469
in engineering have and we don't release

465
00:27:33,469 --> 00:27:36,539
the code behind our simulations how do
you think

466
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:40,039
how do you think we go about you know
pushing out called a

467
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:46,959
leads to a lot by research I'm kinda in
the process of figuring out how myself

468
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:47,849
because

469
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:52,499
I haven't done that before well I have
been a very very poor worry

470
00:27:52,499 --> 00:27:55,729
I'm there are some journals that will

471
00:27:55,729 --> 00:27:59,819
that you can write purely code stuff I'm
not

472
00:27:59,819 --> 00:28:03,399
totally familiar with how to do that yet
because I'm in the process of learning

473
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:05,059
and trying to release

474
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:11,229
a small pipeline irate probably as a
virtual machine to make it easy for

475
00:28:11,229 --> 00:28:12,449
people to use

476
00:28:12,449 --> 00:28:16,619
and capture all of the dependencies I'm

477
00:28:16,619 --> 00:28:20,958
and we're looking at a journal called
kik a science

478
00:28:20,959 --> 00:28:24,389
that seems to be a what what one we have
missed you too hot

479
00:28:24,389 --> 00:28:27,998
I'm afraid I'm not an expert on how to
do that yet

480
00:28:27,999 --> 00:28:32,259
I would like to know I I want to learn
but if you talk to these guys are for

481
00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:33,599
sustainability Institute

482
00:28:33,599 --> 00:28:40,599
that the people I'm talking to about
that kind of thing

483
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,500
hey it's uh it's not so much a question
as a promotion for the AM

484
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,710
so as along with this officer sent
bilities issue with

485
00:28:48,710 --> 00:28:51,810
and created a really set up for engine
is community

486
00:28:51,810 --> 00:28:55,000
Nikkei but a few you're aware of it all

487
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:58,880
but we're trying to get agree people who
are doing this kinda stuff both from the

488
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,670
clinic peeing side and from the

489
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:05,150
biologist try to figure out how to do it
better side to really push to

490
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,430
and get academia see you and

491
00:29:08,430 --> 00:29:13,030
appreciate the work that goes into
software development kit at the moment

492
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:14,160
it's really difficult

493
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:18,100
in it helps justify spending time right
indecent software because you don't get

494
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:21,179
you get grants on that basis you get
rental publications and if you're

495
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,900
wasting six weeks making your coat

496
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:25,940
reusable then as far as

497
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:30,620
money go to waste your time and so yeah
if anybody is doing this kinda stuff

498
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:34,870
and and is interested in trying to push
to improve the situation academia

499
00:29:34,870 --> 00:29:39,100
and www Rs 80 exceed OE K with an ATM

500
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:44,730
coming up saying and a half day in
London say yeah thank you

501
00:29:44,730 --> 00:29:51,730
no thanks that's awesome

502
00:29:55,650 --> 00:29:57,850
thank Pat lighter get around to close to
train
