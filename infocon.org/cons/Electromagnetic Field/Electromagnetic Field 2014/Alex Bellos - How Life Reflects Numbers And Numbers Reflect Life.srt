1
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,800
very this is going to be here

2
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,140
accepted people who don't know who I am
I'm

3
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,170
bus and I

4
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,369
originally started out to a degree in
mass

5
00:00:24,369 --> 00:00:27,670
frosty but then I saw suffering

8
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:37,510
so if you have questions and distal

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,089
you can ask me anything about
mathematics really talk about

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,120
also present in purple and

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,290
four years ago alex has been number that
came out

12
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,059
my first on mass and recently my second
but

13
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:56,489
Alex through the looking glass like
numbers numbers reflect life

14
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,479
and today I'm gonna give you flavor

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:03,510
flavor a kinda

16
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,520
over bit because you're a slightly more

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:12,460
a say text happy

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,649
audience audience sign on it to

19
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:18,720
I've tried I let more things that you
would be

20
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,530

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,900
the only newspaper largely in the world

24
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,600
dedicated mathematics blog like trying
to use every week or two

25
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,070
but something up but I also love having
guest bloggers

26
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,559
want ranking outils

27
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,820
if you have any ideas think you might
want to write on my blog

28
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:52,820
thanks to God get like related

views from well do get in touch on
social media

30
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:00,408
or I'll be selling I was setting the
shop

31
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:03,720
reselling both these but unfortunately
resentful

32
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:05,140
a number land

33
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:09,220
looking glass profitable I will be in
the shop

34
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,130
silent any questions

35
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:17,609
right so what white

36
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,950
I'm not a professional mathematicians I
know I don't stay

37
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:26,850
like there's all day I'm kinda up
popularize and like trying to do is to

38
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:28,350
use the skills

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:31,630
journalism violent through 20

40
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:37,640
Korea newspapers Goshen several

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,988
3 telling stories

42
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,959
three math this idea that especially now

43
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,120
you can get even if information that you
liked by Qt

44
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,280
often you really take things in

45
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,110
you want to learn when this story behind
so

46
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,489
where and wave you stop right masses

47
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:05,040
the most abstract an arcane subject to
write

48
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,120
say things try and make

49
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,470
excite 1 I'm first

50
00:03:12,470 --> 00:03:15,480
and one of the ways tell stories telling
stories about

51
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,630
oneself myself when out events and
online

52
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:23,220
four years ago

53
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:29,359
I would give talks to you universities
page the students

54
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,930
businesses to school military sign

55
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:37,459
every I noticed that

56
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:41,989
the end reach talk someone would always
put their hand and say

57
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,010
yes would like to ask me say

58
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:49,269
what's your favorite number like
remember just

59
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:56,269
internally and she

60
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:59,860
who favorite number I thought they were

61
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:05,950
trucks ridicule when I was trying to do
until hours after so many times that was

62
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,049
exasperated her

63
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:12,069
what was your favorite number and rather
have it was over

64
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,208
well you gotta favorite number

65
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:18,660
yeah the person extensively in a mine 7

66
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,840
and that'll have to be clear favorite
numbers and

67
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,940
over half the audience the hands up

68
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:28,850
and then favorite number I just though

69
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,870
well this is interesting so I

70
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,520
using the tools to a available to me

71
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,289
internet would be really interesting see
anyway like it's scientifically

72
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:45,479
fun too it's possible analyze or
quantify

73
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,780
classified anyway these emotional
responses

74
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:53,109
that we have two numbers and

75
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,580
so I did I set up survey for

76
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,300
civil service favorite number dotnet on
favor numbered on it

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,660
just said what's your favorite number
and why unwanted

78
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:09,250
be suggested between one and two

79
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:12,870
right digits Frank was informed on the
space

80
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,900
why and I realize as case

81
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:21,630
have I'd my safe the world's soils

82
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:26,719
this just make sure buyer

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,030
towards Britain Australia

84
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:33,669
Africa and dying

85
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,479
to know results were and said the
results were

86
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,010
this hopefully you can

87
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:47,599
him on the TV this and

88
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:51,139
when it came out it was actually in most
newspapers

89
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,490
add Metro called the most

90
00:05:54,490 --> 00:06:00,470
using top 10 list everest with him now

91
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:04,260
if you go back to favor numbered on it
now all the result

92
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:07,590
there's a an excel file level the result
other

93
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:10,630
about and

94
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:13,659
said this is not only the bid Michael

95
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,940
talking about responses you that much

96
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:21,280
unit masks committees just

97
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,450
get favor numbered on that let's get
back to you

98
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:28,650
wanna say about this so what is
interesting

99
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:32,919
about favorite numbers essentially and
couple days after it came out

100
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:37,010
is a as a question have have I got news
for you

101
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,030
they went they went 3

102
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:44,400
had the kinda popped back music top 10

103
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,929
ever for is

104
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,430
for five is this is some

105
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,229
brilliantly funny actually least

106
00:06:58,229 --> 00:07:01,870
interesting or the least unusual

107
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,430
will you find when you tryin look spread

108
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:10,510
numbers first you really can't see they
really are trends

109
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:15,800
it that sexually we like their numbers
in the biggest they get

110
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:19,699
like less and so things should
essentially

111
00:07:19,699 --> 00:07:22,870
have then numerical value that position

112
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:26,020
they aren't number certain

113
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,900
qualities numbers push them up

114
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,558
sunfish and session pushes you up

115
00:07:33,559 --> 00:07:37,490
which makes the punch above your way
being alternates

116
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,050
and especially prime with a low numbers
there are only two

117
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,909
non-prime numbers between one and 20
which essentially on prime

118
00:07:45,909 --> 00:07:49,259
the same thing other prime pushes you up

119
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:52,719
even especially round numbers

120
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:56,899
pushes you down so people tend to

121
00:07:56,899 --> 00:08:00,819
as favorites for for our numbers even up

122
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:05,710
actually you can send I coulda told you
I did need to do this

123
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:09,099
40,000 people is my survey for all over
the world

124
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:14,248
a and if you think what are the numbers

125
00:08:14,249 --> 00:08:18,349
other are the most magical mystical
numbers the numbers that we attribute

126
00:08:18,349 --> 00:08:18,960
most

127
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:23,948
non mama meaning since since

128
00:08:23,949 --> 00:08:27,669
dawn of civilization its up numbers

129
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:31,270
well in the end western civilization up
shake

130
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:35,159
years ago health of

131
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,828
when they say they're divinity tivity

132
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,179
and well most

133
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:45,779
mystical numbers at the mall 7

134
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:49,670
obviously 3 truancy

135
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:52,779
13 teen you work fine

136
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:56,329
and even number that

137
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:00,290
is mystical number and why's that

138
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:04,569
there reasons I made animation

139
00:09:04,569 --> 00:09:07,810
to talk about a reason why I think

140
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,560
Sep

141
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,180
was should decide

142
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:15,670
in check hope be either to acquire

143
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:20,660
break we've been obsessed by the number

144
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,500
happen long as we know go back to the
earliest writing

145
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,060
there is time

146
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:30,579
just seven balls

147
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:35,110
777 sisters Politiken

148
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:38,290
wife concise fashion apartment

149
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:42,719
there's plans guide to me

150
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,340
that's just coincidence has a much more
compelling number

151
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,660
among them month had

152
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,199
cannot be defined month within the group

153
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,370
so 12 people fine candor

154
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,800
cyclic 10 at home 9

155
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:05,229
by 3 only one remaining

156
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:08,320
you need it's a loner the side

157
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,670
humans into metal property income

158
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,780
way by associating them things

159
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:20,370
make them special ed more sensitive to
meant

160
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:22,830
this influences on behavior

161
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:26,070
even comp and respect our ability

162
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:29,610
there's another way the world

for decades which is

166
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:45,610
think number thought we had between one
and head what do you think

167
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,830
have up

168
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:53,050
fair the because most people prime

169
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,089
a safer

170
00:10:56,090 --> 00:10:59,770
because 7 feels well

171
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:03,030
what's going on in someone's brain think
around them

172
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:06,290
just something the top head

173
00:11:06,290 --> 00:11:09,480
that want and what you're actually doing
you wouldn't you

174
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:12,650
one is this getting feedback

175
00:11:12,650 --> 00:11:15,880
the problem okay

176
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,380
so you wouldn't use want to understand
around them

177
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,610
he wouldn't you 10 you wouldn't use fide

178
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:26,160
from the middle at just you wouldn you
wouldn't

179
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,439
and then elimination do you foresee

180
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,820
actually doing is your day meant

181
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:36,620
head 7 which is the one which is
numerically

182
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,040
most difficult to get the one feel

183
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,400
random with subconsciously

184
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:48,310
and this

185
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:51,979
difficult think is to me

186
00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:55,020
only possible reason wife 7

187
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:58,240
called be the

188
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,390
spiritual number the number which people
give

189
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:05,810
spiritualist

190
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:10,300
meanings to it some people might say
numerology

191
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,040
you can

192
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,040
is really interesting one nom more

193
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:26,970
other and I think this is say

194
00:12:27,210 --> 00:12:32,520
lead yep

195
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:36,100
all the time there are

196
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:41,850
quite interesting psychology

197
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:45,710
experiment should for example

198
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:51,170
think long up

199
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:54,800
me experiment is this

200
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,910
on the screen you see two-digit

201
00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:02,250
together either both old one is even

202
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,450
all you need both say

203
00:13:05,450 --> 00:13:09,180
by people just press about and

204
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,209
sometime 34 wouldn't

205
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,680
about ones even 10 to

206
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,920
a present that

207
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,089
humans much better

208
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,420
at pressing the bottom

209
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,050
even drop temp lower

210
00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,180
I'll healthy make along

211
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,810
in other words we fight even

212
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:41,489
much easier to process and all numbers
because the heart

213
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:44,950
process brain long and they'll say

214
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:48,820
something more full

215
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,670
in dealing with them

216
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:55,170
now thereby and section

217
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:58,689
up

218
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,890
life numbers a little bit culture

219
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:05,400
in the book on emotional

220
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:08,530
psychological response

221
00:14:08,530 --> 00:14:12,100
numbers surprising already well-known

222
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,990
this builds up to 10 it'll

223
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,030
arithmetic we r where

224
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:25,260
and the prime

225
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:29,270
I want to just now start talking about
the prime numbers

226
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:34,460
prime numbers

227
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:38,930
up numbers

228
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:42,010
grated only to

229
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:46,340
one

230
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:49,880
235 teams

231
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,610
seventy and this is 10 kinda

232
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:57,190
pretty much like the first interesting
day

233
00:14:57,190 --> 00:15:02,800
you find out about actually step

234
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:09,800
what number is gonna be prime

235
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,370
haunted everything up

236
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:17,710
prime nothing divided pride

237
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:21,830
way

238
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:24,540
no way of predicting

239
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,459
prime somethings so

240
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:30,989
base that israeli interest the first
people

241
00:15:30,990 --> 00:15:34,389
called sessions till now

242
00:15:34,389 --> 00:15:37,730
huge area Reese

243
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:43,870
now everest of the knees

244
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:48,220
famous Greek and there's a sleek

245
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:53,410
no already know you very much fact
famous

246
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:56,480
alchemy everyone is the Hasselblad

247
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,620
worth of sorry he was brilliant

248
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:04,100
invented lows every instinct things his
appointment he was the founder

249
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:07,370
geography for example his nickname with

250
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,910
beater he was always known as the guy
who was second best

251
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:14,889
the had the bad luck being around the
same time as our communities

252
00:16:14,889 --> 00:16:18,899
with just of everyone miss him think
there's

253
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:22,420
posted said there's these

254
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,680
which is away have fine

255
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:31,969
prime leather this is

256
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,569
from basic algorithm computer science
problem

257
00:16:36,569 --> 00:16:40,790
basic algorithm the first up

258
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:44,170
in you want to do

259
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:51,170
fine the prime numbers

260
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:54,460
stop

261
00:16:54,460 --> 00:16:58,410
you get number if it's free

262
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:02,160
its prime and then you eliminate

263
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,250
all stop one

264
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:11,680
prime good prime

265
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:18,680
we Lee yep

266
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:25,250
but the three 33 three prime wheatly

267
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:31,310
month 3 as really nice you never did

268
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:37,110
full

269
00:17:37,110 --> 00:17:40,580
take 5 5 prime

270
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:45,010
5 5 his

271
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:48,030
cross to old

272
00:17:48,030 --> 00:17:51,530
3 net

273
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,810
letter and what's if that an

274
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,940
said 100

275
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,560
got 10 there's a

276
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:09,310
free three lines in the back

277
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:13,960
urged bills from this

278
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,100
like night happen you can tell

279
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:20,959
he things why is that all prime numbers

280
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:27,960
be one one more up

281
00:18:32,429 --> 00:18:36,909
and also we see carry on

282
00:18:36,909 --> 00:18:41,130
day

283
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:48,049
not random

284
00:18:48,049 --> 00:18:51,059
say around element

285
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:56,668
now

286
00:18:56,669 --> 00:18:59,830
prime numbers the

287
00:18:59,830 --> 00:19:03,270
the

288
00:19:03,270 --> 00:19:07,929
researched mathematics 2,000 years

289
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:12,070
than you think

290
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:15,820
to find that in 1963

291
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,770
54-year-old polish-american
mathematician

292
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,070
them %um with in a lecture

293
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:27,210
Hillary America really bored aged

294
00:19:27,210 --> 00:19:31,370
he had grades he numbers

295
00:19:31,370 --> 00:19:35,049
spiraling at and

296
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:40,990
across of the prime and he never been
noted

297
00:19:40,990 --> 00:19:47,990
prime said

298
00:19:49,169 --> 00:19:52,860
100

299
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:59,270
is random but is not totally random

300
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:05,049
fragments order that we pump it up

301
00:20:05,049 --> 00:20:09,940
this is prime again

302
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:14,399
elements order that so when they say yes
the prime

303
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:20,250
Iran that balance between

304
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:24,230
order and hale's which is kind of where
the interesting stuff

305
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,620
some things like hope boring something

306
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:33,830
totally chaotic

307
00:20:33,830 --> 00:20:34,740
music

308
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:39,700
coming through the NYS which is really
was interesting so

309
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:44,050
Stan great

310
00:20:44,050 --> 00:20:47,850
interesting guy

311
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:51,689
and his me southville

312
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:54,930
say born in Poland and

313
00:20:54,930 --> 00:20:58,010
his part group I'll amazing

314
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:01,650
positions in the nineteen twenties and
thirties

315
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:06,870
world in love which was imposed ukraine
and

316
00:21:06,870 --> 00:21:13,870
because I the most

317
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:19,170
got that thanks John

318
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:26,170
best friend right on

319
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,980
lyman whose Hungarian

320
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:33,190
also in the mid

321
00:21:33,190 --> 00:21:37,010
red

322
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:43,690
fine great

323
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:44,910
and this is take

324
00:21:44,910 --> 00:21:48,170
there'll you could say that these three
guys

325
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:55,170
in the West world possibly three
scientists I say this with any

326
00:21:55,330 --> 00:22:01,050
shop 3 change the modern world more than
anyone else

327
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:08,050
weapons which

328
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,949
shaped cool

329
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:21,830
like amazing thing

330
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:28,090
probably the great mathematician bread

331
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:35,090
sharing huge

332
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:41,110
probably branch man

333
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,129
and physics the make series

334
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:47,970
contribution him

335
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:51,120
the comes structure

336
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:58,120
computing and helping computers

337
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:02,620
were now and quite a lot

338
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,989
emigre Eastern Europeans

339
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,890
up

340
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:17,100
people and on wanted

341
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:24,100
unique is also struggling with these
ideas

342
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:31,320
he was kinda future

343
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:36,389
Europe anyone else I'm night century

344
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:40,020
then computing today

345
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:45,030
and he started just think about robots
and robot may be taking over the world

346
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,050
you know the nineteen fifties Hollywood

347
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:55,419
you want it

348
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:59,530
what would it take for a machine to
replicate

349
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:03,530
for machine to make and

350
00:24:03,530 --> 00:24:07,320
this is actually

351
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,950
logical mathematical question his

352
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,580
the way

353
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:19,710
so anything but just so you have a
machine

354
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:23,530
you want to get machines

355
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:26,649
computer computer to replicate

356
00:24:26,650 --> 00:24:29,920
as you need to give it some instructions

357
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:33,100
same given instructions call

358
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:37,870
the blueprint the blueprint what it
needs to do to say this machine can read

359
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:38,610
the blueprint

360
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:41,979
and then it can make an eMachine a que

361
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,370
say

362
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,040
does the

363
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:51,950
new machine contain a blueprint

364
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:55,049
because if it does

365
00:24:55,049 --> 00:25:00,700
would have to be instructions to make a
blueprint within the blueprint then

366
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:04,020
that blueprint itself haven't had to
make

367
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:07,340
re he realized that if you want to have
a machine

368
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,110
Rep by this process readings from Rep

369
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:15,229
you cannot do it with adding another
element

370
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:19,290
which be some images copies the
blueprint

371
00:25:19,290 --> 00:25:22,480
what happens when you want have a
machine

372
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,650
re instructions instructions will
replicate

373
00:25:25,650 --> 00:25:30,260
just machine and then you need a
blueprint copia

374
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:33,450
which copies the blueprint and how the
blueprint

375
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:36,669
machine and then type

376
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:40,809
machine have machine and

377
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:44,490
what's interesting this was very

378
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:47,620
inspired biologists working at the time

379
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:50,620
because several when people

380
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,850
what DNA it's pretty much exactly is

381
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:57,780
online what time have to work the NSA

382
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:01,240
is essentially the blueprint
instructions

383
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,730
had been set in DNA there is no
instructions on how to build DNA

384
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:09,900
because the NSW let's and split

385
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,240
res pic Jan same

386
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:17,230
DNA element

387
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:20,230
instructions also be copying machine
copies

388
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:25,929
this is another great idea

389
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:30,530
I with you can understand man has to be
like that

390
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:35,450
math like that and then when you
actually

391
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:39,580
told moment wanted

392
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,770
build a machine Rep cells something
which re

393
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:48,400
machine instructions had a copy a fried

394
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,460
build one then realized he's getting

395
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:54,900
ball in the mechanic

396
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:58,559
knowledge did mechanics and

397
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,408
he said completely simplify

398
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:07,850
and invented new mathematical idea which
is what I want to talk about now

399
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:12,209
the rest talk cellular automata cell

400
00:27:12,210 --> 00:27:17,270
thomason with an idea invented

401
00:27:17,270 --> 00:27:21,110
hell which is the more which is

402
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:24,360
agreed to sell each cell

403
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:28,469
number States and what it does

404
00:27:28,470 --> 00:27:31,620
just depends on the state's neighboring
cells

405
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:35,229
and he built a patent for cellular
automata

406
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,230
which theoretically reproduce

407
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,510
computers big enough because it

408
00:27:45,510 --> 00:27:49,110
200,000 lives sales taken

409
00:27:49,110 --> 00:27:53,010
generation to do that theoretically was
kinda free

410
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:57,010
so this is the nineteen fifties this
idea

411
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,330
simplification this model called

412
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:05,010
you think I haven't played that calls

413
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:08,450
what they doing with much more
complicated

414
00:28:08,450 --> 00:28:12,340
want to talk about it which is in the
late sixties British mathematician

415
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,760
came John Conway reinvented

416
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,840
this idea said to make war

417
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,870
is one the most famous pieces
recreational

418
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:28,239
and was actually in a sense responsible
for the first computer craze

419
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:31,430
which is cool the Gamefly which he

420
00:28:31,430 --> 00:28:35,560
took and simplified from where on Lyman

421
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:39,210
you land started I'll I'm gonna through
what the game

422
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:42,560
life is simply very simple

423
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:46,310
using get really complicated and a
really beautiful way

424
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:49,590
set this is a great

425
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:54,230
much to the national grid it's got sales
Square is a cell

426
00:28:54,230 --> 00:28:58,120
cell might be alive or dead the
lifestyle

427
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:01,479
black with the lifestyle everything
around it dead

428
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:06,870
was around same name

429
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:11,399
and they rock runs on one line

430
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,330
lives the five lines which basically
explains

431
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:18,750
the rules all genetic lolzz

432
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:22,520
the Gamefly and now it's not a game with
winners or losers

433
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:27,440
as well get a world

434
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,920
which is this grid and we want

435
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:34,430
put some life sales and then just see
how they grow

436
00:29:34,430 --> 00:29:39,260
is a kind of a model for the evolution
get reflect life how we can

437
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:43,140
numbers and math kinda model life so

438
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:46,710
that get if you have a lifestyle

439
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:51,960
had 01 live will die

440
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,970
by let life

441
00:29:54,970 --> 00:30:00,260
two or three loud by for more like

442
00:30:00,260 --> 00:30:04,960
cases cells cannot be alive or dead

443
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:09,000
that just two states for my mom had
twenty-seven states week

444
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,970
game life

445
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,470
dead name

446
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:19,830
come alive all the cases remain

447
00:30:19,830 --> 00:30:23,120
this is that this is the entire city

448
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,520
all the rules of the game life and

449
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:31,600
what we do you have a pattern

450
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,199
with the number lifestyles applied

451
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,720
rules with the gym law on each the sales

452
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:42,230
in the universe at the same time

453
00:30:42,230 --> 00:30:47,080
and then you get the next generation
head

454
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,129
through very simply and if you have a
month

455
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,170
hand occasional side

456
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:58,520
so this is say generation

457
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:02,389
one like that this one here

458
00:31:02,390 --> 00:31:06,560
this one here surrounded by

459
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,700
1 this is gonna die he's gonna die

460
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,810
by one life

461
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:17,330
gonna die here the ride

462
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:20,480
gonna survive this one here

463
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:24,650
dead realized

464
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:31,460
people next-generation

465
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,090
all

466
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:40,009
we we clear we get yes and then

467
00:31:40,009 --> 00:31:46,099
after that that will die

468
00:31:46,099 --> 00:31:49,649
okay new

469
00:31:49,649 --> 00:31:53,809
3 in over some

470
00:31:53,809 --> 00:31:59,019
three life this then die

471
00:31:59,019 --> 00:32:02,219
and calmly shows lolzz that

472
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:05,259
going to incur made unpredictable

473
00:32:05,259 --> 00:32:10,499
he did things diet everything to die

474
00:32:10,499 --> 00:32:13,849
were keep on growing and it became re

475
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:17,830
hip-hop what's gonna happen doing

476
00:32:17,830 --> 00:32:24,199
in the late sixties computers had ago

477
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,929
and then ago able to get help next to an
Israeli

478
00:32:27,929 --> 00:32:33,200
complicated so much fun sequentially
here

479
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,339
and then

480
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:40,369
stable get

481
00:32:40,369 --> 00:32:47,369
block state here Blanca

482
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:56,409
this one here we just

483
00:32:56,409 --> 00:33:03,409
applying those simple rules at the
beginning

484
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,169
traffic lights which full

485
00:33:15,169 --> 00:33:18,520
first if

486
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:23,820
new world and they were naturalists

487
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:26,850
takes on a bus going seen the new
creatures and giving them

488
00:33:26,850 --> 00:33:30,428
and then when the 3

489
00:33:30,429 --> 00:33:33,840
cell patents for soap they

490
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
so this happen which

491
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:40,059
blew their minds the first sign really

492
00:33:40,059 --> 00:33:45,428
is going to be very this five up

493
00:33:45,429 --> 00:33:51,240
for generations

494
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:55,149
one

495
00:33:55,149 --> 00:34:01,330
because it looks

496
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:04,649
do it lying along

497
00:34:04,649 --> 00:34:09,418
now John Conway told us tomorrow

498
00:34:09,418 --> 00:34:13,589
in nineteen Scientific American
Scientific American

499
00:34:13,589 --> 00:34:18,060
article month gone King novel

500
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:22,070
signs right the famous column

501
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:25,320
most thirty years American column

502
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,839
most column got more ease interested

503
00:34:28,839 --> 00:34:32,739
call more response anything else

504
00:34:32,739 --> 00:34:36,000
with his first column on

505
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,139
the game of life and Conway said

506
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:46,429
I will is there keeps on number live
cells

507
00:34:46,429 --> 00:34:51,230
keeps on growing I'll give fifty dollars

508
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:54,870
and 13 got MIT

509
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:58,029
he with the student something use that

510
00:34:58,030 --> 00:35:01,650
some leaders they had their and actually
this is where the word

511
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:04,890
comes from regional hackers

512
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:10,120
people MIT MIT Model Railway Club

513
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,660
just creative customization

514
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,529
the model railway hackers got into the
game of life

515
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:22,130
and some see it like it is

516
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:25,430
in them the

517
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:28,560
became said

518
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,730
first computer craze because laws

519
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:36,740
send you get such amazingly complex help

520
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:40,600
is on the first link

521
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,720
you and so I'm gonna show you now

522
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,200
the first pattern which

523
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,399
get bigger more more number my cell

524
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,400
increases without bound school live 36

525
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:07,050
shoes glide

526
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,410
and is good

527
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,299
way she and then

528
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:22,300
another

529
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:27,160
eater

530
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:30,549
eat everything that he's firing okay

531
00:36:30,549 --> 00:36:37,549
things coming you game much stop

532
00:36:39,579 --> 00:36:42,880
being a bad discovering new things

533
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,980
and actually back have engineering you

534
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,500
had a yep

535
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:52,710
rather

536
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:57,210
just like constructing massive

537
00:36:57,210 --> 00:37:00,710
things way glide because you clean

538
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,549
blinded and I want to show you

539
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:08,009
and is one other I my favorite patterns

540
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,400
and we can come talk to me about it

541
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,760
life afterwards I'm gonna get

542
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:21,279
goalie which is the bests of playing
with Gamefly

543
00:37:21,279 --> 00:37:27,049
okay this is ap

544
00:37:27,049 --> 00:37:30,660
a lot clearer this is the kinda Classic
Game life engineering

545
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:35,200
and I'm just gonna play that anyone is

546
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,029
what we've got at the moment and

547
00:37:39,029 --> 00:37:42,349
let's go in essentially kinda

548
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:46,140
Jain game Bagatelle with gliders

549
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:53,140
going everywhere collisions K

550
00:37:59,590 --> 00:37:59,960
one

551
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:03,280
his this is

552
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:07,050
thus if there's knees we

553
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:10,430
to for the power which

554
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:14,169
same prime number let's go saying hi

555
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,670
what's going on here we've got spaceship

556
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:22,160
coming basically anything which number
two

557
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,790
3 for not prime to the position

558
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:29,779
the space yes if it prime that not prime

559
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,220
get become a postcard all

560
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:36,730
which basically

561
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:40,330
killing

562
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:43,580
comes every re

563
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,630
3

564
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:53,630
here producing

565
00:38:55,930 --> 00:38:59,270
one every up doing even numbers because
we

566
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:02,680
free Nate even numbers the prime

567
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:05,779
here let's go from beginning

568
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:12,780
again

569
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:24,759
1

570
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,640
okay

571
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:30,160
to 34 fun said

572
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,379
come through is nine his wife three

573
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:37,460
through this one levels gonna 3

574
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:40,480
13 15 15

575
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,340
35 book 5 coming through yes so actually

576
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:50,280
this is just a fantastic
reinterpretation airsoft

577
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:55,660
knees and this week Karen have the big
game will keep on

578
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,220
just prime number

579
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:03,930
not on the final say well we already
have

580
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:07,299
there's uses local

581
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:11,330
USPAP interesting but what can you
actually do you

582
00:40:11,330 --> 00:40:14,700
with the game life seems so simple every

583
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:18,270
listening to the Excel next

584
00:40:18,270 --> 00:40:21,860
five very very simple rules well
actually

585
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:25,620
you can build in the game life to do

586
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:28,680
absolutely anything any computer

587
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,569
would ap how does that work

588
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:39,570
the final slide

589
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:46,009
to

590
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,030
we saw those on lives streams

591
00:40:49,030 --> 00:40:53,100
what is a computer computer essentially
bunch

592
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,589
wise and a logic gates

593
00:40:56,590 --> 00:41:00,590
and a memory register we can emulate all
of those things

594
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:03,960
in the game live by using why

595
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:10,070
the when

596
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:13,330
0 lighter someone

597
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:17,040
which is just like polls polls

598
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,040
basic you can build

599
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:32,200
memory register so amazing to think

600
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:36,319
you could create

601
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,780
everything is in my mind pro

602
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:43,510
could b1 absolutely massive happen

603
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,670
you just press play way

604
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:52,580
and up also kinda philosophical idea
that maybe

605
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:57,049
life itself is some kinda cellular
automata

606
00:41:57,050 --> 00:42:01,180
so that we are all generation you've
been

607
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,810
trillion for generations on of some kind
initial formation

608
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:10,450
and discrete problem continues

609
00:42:10,450 --> 00:42:15,299
say I ran a time

610
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:18,640
I hope I gave you an idea

611
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,770
with information favorite number life

612
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:25,500
numbers which is why image did in is how
we position sales

613
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,420
we have

614
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:30,970
up response have numbers themselves

615
00:42:30,970 --> 00:42:33,980
and math can be used

616
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:40,819
model thing about life interesting

617
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:44,109
way life Weiwei

618
00:42:44,109 --> 00:42:47,690
I'll be

619
00:42:47,690 --> 00:42:51,020
shop

620
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:58,020
minute many questions anything
interesting

621
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:03,700
right blog thank you very much
