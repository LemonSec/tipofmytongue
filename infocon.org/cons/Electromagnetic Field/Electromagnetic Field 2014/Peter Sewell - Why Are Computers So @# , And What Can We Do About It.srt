her

255
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:31,090
of her Ross mall

256
00:21:31,779 --> 00:21:36,760
the mall not this here

257
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,460
all than usual

258
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,809

here

268
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:35,540
want to make something happen more

269
00:22:37,410 --> 00:22:41,050
humor unlawful

270
00:22:41,050 --> 00:22:45,360
do love you all law and

271
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,729
his him

272
00:22:48,730 --> 00:22:52,750
all see

273
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,920
test love it gonna sell

274
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:01,320
these people any

275
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,439
weird

276
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:11,120
for me all okay

277
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:15,050
little or

278
00:23:15,050 --> 00:23:19,040
gold member gary is created being people
but also rejected by nato

279
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,639
in with %uh pulled off the loan excluded
by the for my cousin

280
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:29,640
had written about the whole bottle make
got left so this is very deceptive

281
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:33,780
stuff because it looks like they fought
really hard about it and it means

282
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,780
something for Saif

283
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,270
but you just don't quite understand we
thought that's a long time

284
00:23:40,270 --> 00:23:44,480
and we try to make mathematical models
have this but in fact

285
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,360
when you get to it and you got
experiments and you go and talk to the

286
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,490
architect what we do

287
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,610
we collaborate with a very smart and
fine I'll IBM architect

288
00:23:52,610 --> 00:23:59,610
on this stuff you find this does not
describe what they actually do

289
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,890
okay and if you talk to

290
00:24:05,890 --> 00:24:09,900
%uh architect about that text they say
this kind of thing

291
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,870
all horrible Harley incomprehensible and
confusing text that no one compulsory in

292
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,179
with

293
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,440
not even the people who wrote it on this
wall

294
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:22,060
want to people right so

295
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:27,669
a misery a misery I say um so there's a
basic problem here which is that these

296
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:32,840
the defection in the industry that we
can write true specifications

297
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:37,129
and safe programmers just read this book
I write your program

298
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:41,620
a seeming only the facts in this book
and then

299
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:45,020
well then what do they do

300
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:48,760
they go away and I read a book I didn't
really understand it because it is not

301
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:49,920
comprehensible

302
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:53,310
does not have a meaning I am and then

303
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:57,310
they write the code Bali that trial and
error development process by testing

304
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:59,659
against the particular implementations
that they have

305
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:03,160
on the particular execution also they
happened to explore

306
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,870
right so this is rubbish but you can't
use these for special occasions

307
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,979
to test programs you can't use them the
test at the hardware

308
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:15,340
those what intended you can't use them
certainly not to prove properties were

309
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:15,939
anything

310
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:19,330
and as we see can even use them to
communicate

311
00:25:19,330 --> 00:25:22,590
between the organizations that are
making the thing

312
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,310
new organizations that in using the
thing which is the basic things

313
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:27,080
specification

314
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,260
or be able to do I so in this set sent

315
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:34,150
none of the specifications really exist

316
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:40,809
it's all imaginary it's a happy dream

317
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:41,860
so what we do

318
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:46,740
um I was raised up and as experimental
scientist

319
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,750
and the Oracle Financial come least

320
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,940
slightly to our rescue her so

321
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:56,679
we can indeed we have invented some

322
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,130
mathematically precise models and how we
think these things behave

323
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:03,990
not how they were looking for aid but
just how they behave from the program is

324
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:04,710
.2 few

325
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:08,690
and many make tools

326
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,299
but don't just cut late one call but for
the small programs explore

327
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:16,450
all of the possible execution to give
you the set

328
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:19,870
the everything the diesel al annette

329
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:23,350
you can run experiments on my fame
console programs

330
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,240
a to compare and then compare the
experimental data

331
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:31,640
to check that is all all the experiment
lee allowed executions

332
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,770
all actually allow by your model on

333
00:26:34,770 --> 00:26:37,789
and sometimes they're not too if they're
not been either

334
00:26:37,789 --> 00:26:41,370
you found a bug in the person so and you
think pop we win

335
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:45,299
all you found a bug in your mobile and
you get to pick up your mobile into it

336
00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:45,760
true

337
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,490
and then you say we would I on then

338
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:53,950
in order to know whether these things a
bugs or not you have to talk to the

339
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:54,450
object

340
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:58,850
what's not a Celtic took is someone who
can by definition tell you

341
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:02,830
with observe purchase a behavior is a
bug or not i'd

342
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:08,189
it's there in 10 but matters here and
also you need to talk to them to make

343
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:08,919
sure the mobile

344
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,350
match their intuition to get some
assurance that you all

345
00:27:12,350 --> 00:27:16,870
talking total month and then you get
some other validation so you can prove

346
00:27:16,870 --> 00:27:20,549
they both these machine model you can
prove that you can compile

347
00:27:20,549 --> 00:27:24,440
c11 concurrency down to these machine
models and that gives you a bit more

348
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,169
confidence

349
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:28,370
but all of them are the so sensible and
then

350
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:31,629
goes all the singer/actress better if
you go back to one

351
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:36,920
and do it all again better as he
probably worth of stuff from first time

352
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:40,080
so a is this rocket science

353
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:44,889
no rockets onto I think at 1:45 on stage
I can't remember which

354
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,770
I am it's not very hard

355
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,840
really so all we've done

356
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:54,939
is right down well

357
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:58,710
we've yet identified one of these
abstraction layers that we really care

358
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:02,480
out and we've written down a description
all

359
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
not just some implementation but all the
behavior we think should be allowed that

360
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,560
abstraction layer

361
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:11,540
and then we've tested real systems
against that

362
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:17,420
uninformed so we've written down those
those definitions about affect the

363
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,070
behavior

364
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:21,409
in some random mathematical language
doesn't really matter wat but you could

365
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:22,290
do anything

366
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,000
anything which is clear and concise and
has on ambiguous meaning

367
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,150
you could if you really have to doing
Seco so long as you understand that your

368
00:28:31,150 --> 00:28:31,990
writing down

369
00:28:31,990 --> 00:28:35,180
a definition of all the allow behavior

370
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:39,050
and that definition must be executed
we'll not as the system

371
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:45,800
but as a test oracle to decide if some
observed behavior is allowable not so

372
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,840
that the thing that people don't often
do

373
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,560
it's very easy is not worth it

374
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:55,020
all the time you know it you're building
some app up for something

375
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:59,150
you may not even have a clue beforehand
what it's supposed to do for any of

376
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,450
these infrastructure things that we
depend on

377
00:29:01,450 --> 00:29:05,020
and that's all reimplemented in many
contexts it's clearly were

378
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:10,120
and when you've done that then you not
limited your testing process that was

379
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,510
still stuck with the time being

380
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:14,879
you not limited to the few ad hoc test
that you

381
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,020
you right now you're gone Oracle looking
tell me whether

382
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:21,750
any behavior is good or not you can do
random testing

383
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,650
you get in

384
00:29:22,650 --> 00:29:26,180
is any better coverage and find millions
bucks

385
00:29:26,180 --> 00:29:29,690
okay I can't even read that flight

386
00:29:29,690 --> 00:29:33,090
%uh I said that

387
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:37,120
I am so I said that first time stop

388
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:41,320
pretty much so why im there was some
reasons why building robust system the

389
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:43,300
heart and there are things we can do
about it

390
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:47,629
and some them all absolutely trivial and
then in the longer term

391
00:29:47,630 --> 00:29:51,610
for some hope for on it for a vacation
so

392
00:29:51,610 --> 00:29:55,520
II give you i think is a very cautious
optimism

393
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:00,129
but I also thought you a to think about
this kind of stuff because you just

394
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:01,710
imagine the situation

395
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:05,010
50 is now a hundred years from now boy

396
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:08,590
civilization just a thousand years from
now if we don't

397
00:30:08,590 --> 00:30:12,800
fix this stuff up if we don't fix it up
stuff up we will have

398
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,629
the x86 abstraction the sockets API

399
00:30:16,630 --> 00:30:20,310
the SSL API imbedded through some

400
00:30:20,310 --> 00:30:27,310
dos least active emulation layers in
everything we use

401
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,679
for the rest of civilization

402
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:37,680
the end thank you for your attention

403
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:46,320
if you've got any any questions a
question

404
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,500
five questions free almost 50 minutes
Bowl next talk

405
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,700
car

406
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,940
have you done

407
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:00,470
the work or even the acquired experience
up

408
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:03,610
how these prices my whole he's getting

409
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:06,820
easier as died try her

410
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:11,600
I'm did different place if we met we
know how to do it much better than we

411
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,240
did before and that they were

412
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:18,260
so there are some questions and relating
to howl nondeterministic how loose a

413
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:19,590
specification you need

414
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,030
that relate to how you can write that
specification in a way that makes

415
00:31:23,030 --> 00:31:26,690
actually usable and there are other some
sociological question that how you talk

416
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:29,760
to the designers all the sea standards
committee or whatever

417
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:33,450
in order to get them to understand that
this is a good idea if you walk into a

418
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:34,790
sea standards committee meeting

419
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:39,399
and accident a show them a piece of
paper with a little too much math in

420
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,170
like an upside-down I a then they they
go you know all queasy

421
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:46,970
because that's just not the language
they were lookin we have to take care

422
00:31:46,970 --> 00:31:51,680
with that kind of stuff any more quick
question

423
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,129
question over that

424
00:31:55,129 --> 00:31:58,530
home I totally agree on the design

425
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:01,230
for language but think most prone

426
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:05,700
most are Texas move on construction
Arc'teryx want to build a computer or

427
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:11,049
with every Arctic possibility people and
they have to agree to stop them

428
00:32:11,049 --> 00:32:14,049
to Compostela broker should

429
00:32:14,049 --> 00:32:18,120
so communication remains key a

430
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,520
I'm yeah I but

431
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:25,170
how can you prevent that there are
additional cost to complex

432
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,890
it to expand make threw up

433
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:32,770
so it's an interesting question to how
to how can we arrange for there to be a

434
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,549
pushback

435
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:36,830
against adding complexity that's really
tough

436
00:32:36,830 --> 00:32:41,139
but at least a programming language
design and the summer these abstractions

437
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,919
the mere fact writing down I E

438
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,630
clean specification the forces you

439
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:52,440
to notice the complexity on which
otherwise

440
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,820
if you just have a texter language back
it's very easy to just say

441
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:58,740
a which will let with gun and a new
feature we're just talking a couple

442
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:00,290
paragraphs of text here

443
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:03,879
and that doesn't force you to understand
how it interacts with everything else

444
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:08,240
so that I mean this is not a total
solution I think there is a total

445
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:10,370
solution but that does give you feedback
mechanism

446
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,668
that we don't have at the moment one
behind you

447
00:33:15,669 --> 00:33:19,860
find you Bihar

448
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,909
do believe there's much more market at
the moment

449
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:25,490
for formal verification not have the
likely to the itself but I've

450
00:33:25,490 --> 00:33:28,730
programs written in like a market

451
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:33,870
I think not much I think there is
potentially a significant market bull

452
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:37,080
on was a very particular

453
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,159
systems infrastructure to be verified I
so

454
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:45,490
if I had a verified hypervisor with us
for just about to do tonight

455
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:49,680
running on my phone I would be a happy
man when I come to MN cam

456
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:54,560
and to in the industry want that kind of
thing and there are some companies

457
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:01,560
doing that he said he'll poor thing from
her commercialization

458
00:34:02,059 --> 00:34:05,928
but I'll as owner buying I'm last one

459
00:34:05,929 --> 00:34:09,830
last month

460
00:34:09,830 --> 00:34:12,100
sorry for PHP is the worst

461
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,120
language in a mall which one would you
say is the best

462
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:22,120
a fire is open I was thinking about
giving this talk to not answer any

463
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:24,239
questions that general for

464
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:27,500
and in some ten I don't know

465
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:30,520
I'm not in a position to know I do right

466
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:33,920
a whole lotta code on

467
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,170
what I do when I'm up I in my group do

468
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:40,740
we use O'Connell on Haskell and sensible

469
00:34:40,739 --> 00:34:44,359
you know functional imperative languages
that

470
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:49,100
very good for this kind of semantic
infrastructure kind of work

471
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:54,230
in other contexts I'm not going to
comment

472
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:55,300
K enough thank you
