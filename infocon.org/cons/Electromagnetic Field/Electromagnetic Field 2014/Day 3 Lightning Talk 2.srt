1
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:17,750
GB USB stick or should I just walk

2
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:29,040
sometimes I do love softer magic

3
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,680
so I guess I'm going to talk about
software defined radio

4
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:42,370
I whose her to suffer defined radio okay

5
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:45,449
this may be born this may not be we'll
see I

6
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:49,360
what is it why should you care and the
really simple thing about it is

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,160
I yes hi I'm interesting up my name's
Derek by the way

8
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:58,069
I so to radio in which most to the
functions are moved from hardware into

9
00:00:58,070 --> 00:00:58,850
software

10
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,379
and if there's one thing that we know
about hardware there was expectedly

11
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:04,190
outlined in the talk about the badges

12
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,149
Harbor takes a long time to develop and
want to develop that you really don't

13
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,020
wanna change it

14
00:01:09,020 --> 00:01:12,149
because it's expensive and all that
softer on the other hand

15
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:16,100
each recompiling you like oh you know I
felt that I'm gonna change is constant

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:21,199
recompile and run again and so when
you've defined the radio that way that

17
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,369
means you can just

18
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:26,640
download a new modulation scheme and
start instantly transmitting

19
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,180
or receiving a and what that means is
this a lot apps

20
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,430
are free software out there that can do
this there's a lot of other things

21
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,670
i commercial sweet stuff like that and

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,470
yet basically this is an example of a
radio frequency coming in

23
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,920
and in hardware you have to actually
build up the capacitors build-out

24
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,930
are all the stuff to be modulated in
software some the streets

25
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,049
ike specially can you read his block
diagram Cheick

26
00:01:51,049 --> 00:01:54,780
I one FM receiver like drag run awesome

27
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,510
arm sis this is

28
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:02,070
you know the 101 so signals you have
analog signals which is what

29
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:05,490
the actual entire world is any need to
convert them into digital

30
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:09,399
because you computer unfortunately
doesn't store analog values

31
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,269
so an analog signals to find for all
possible times and his street time

32
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,060
signal is only defined for certain

33
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,930
usually regular intervals and what this
ends up looking like

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:22,150
is have a continuous thing coming in and
you sample

35
00:02:22,150 --> 00:02:25,450
see your sampling rate is one of those
critical you know things when you're

36
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:27,060
looking at a softer defined radio

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:30,340
you end up with a whole bunch of
different sample values and

38
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:33,900
there's a whole bunch it so you have
these values and now you have to figure

39
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,269
out

40
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:38,060
what was the original signal that this
represents and see you

41
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,560
for each time stamp give a value and the
more bits

42
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:44,890
the you have in your analog to digital
converter the better the resolution that

43
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,390
you get

44
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:48,819
the better that you can figure out what
the original signal was

45
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:52,268
so you know more bits better is to take
away from the slide

46
00:02:52,269 --> 00:02:55,349
and who comply connect the dots

47
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,379
what we got here to shout it out sine
wave

48
00:02:59,379 --> 00:03:05,060
looks pretty obvious right it's going to
be that 08 but it could be that

49
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,209
and it could be that so

50
00:03:08,209 --> 00:03:12,049
this is called aliasing and you have to
sample at least twice as fast as what

51
00:03:12,049 --> 00:03:13,390
you're expecting to receive

52
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,510
on and so what this comes down do is

53
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:20,679
generally what they do is they put in a
great big filter that enforces this rule

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,590
and not wait you're no longer having to
his government might be it might not be

55
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:29,190
you know that way you're receiving is
psych going to obey this law

56
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,620
and so this means you have to be
sampling fast enough to receive whatever

57
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,890
signal you're interested in

58
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,510
and her voice this is usually about 1.6
kill her tits

59
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,899
arm if you're transmitting like beer
when the radios

60
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,750
on but it can be quite a bit wider or
can be quite a bit narrower depending on

61
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:45,560
what are you doing I

62
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,450
Morse code or digital mode or you're
trying to transmit

63
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:52,619
on you know Ltd for your phone is what

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,880
20 megahertz wide I believe at least in
some configurations

65
00:03:56,880 --> 00:04:00,780
this one st art looks like and basically
an antenna

66
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:04,250
and then there's some mixing so that you
can extract are

67
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:08,030
lots of information about the signal
accurately get the representation back

68
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:12,510
getting the amplitude and phase arm and
the frequency

69
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,750
all in one go and filter and the new
convert

70
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,470
analog to digital but some I'd
somebody's St ours

71
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,039
you end up plugging in VN audio cable as
we call this a sound card STR

72
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,969
and you're letting your PC do all the
work so these tend to be a lot cheaper

73
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,970
arm and you get these quite cheaply
online

74
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:34,740
on yes receiver architectures

75
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:38,340
II if your radio but you're party
already know this

76
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:42,638
if you art there's probably no point in
me explains sigh I should confess that I

77
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,800
am remixing a slide deck that I already
had

78
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,190
on so this is what it's actually really
quite cool

79
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:54,550
you're receiving a whole bunch a bomb FM
radio station so here we turned into 10

80
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:57,750
I 10 5.3 and you can see

81
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,770
I is a signal here that speaking and
this is what it actually looks

82
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:05,039
like when you're receiving and FM
broadcast station

83
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:08,940
now it's quite cool here is you can
actually see it starting to decode

84
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:12,479
the radioed a year I service stream

85
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,389
service on as you can see it's decoding
the information that normally see

86
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:18,090
displayed on your car stereo

87
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,359
and that's actually the sidebands here
his role that digital information is

88
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,180
conveyed along

89
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,400
CDC it's very graphical environment its

90
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,599
I very intuitive to work with you can
tune across you can see how big should

91
00:05:30,599 --> 00:05:31,509
be felt s

92
00:05:31,509 --> 00:05:35,580
arm and so many many more radios are
being built

93
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,780
this way out band with some common modes
a priority said

94
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:44,349
they vary you have to be sampling at
least twice as fast as whatever the band

95
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:44,690
with

96
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:48,780
is here arm and this

97
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,698
this is what I want you to all go away
and by it's about 10 pack but ten pounds

98
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:55,770
fifteen pounds comes with an antenna

99
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,719
and I use plug this straight into your

100
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,419
I'm PC laptop I A

101
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,030
Raspberry Pi has lots of libraries for
dealing with it

102
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:10,340
and this handles all up the converting I

103
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:14,330
into digital signals and yet its
regional aid

104
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,430
a TV tuner and as somebody found out
that if you poke the firmware just the

105
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:20,569
right way with send you the raw stream

106
00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:25,599
I and it receives from about 50
megahertz 22.2 gigahertz

107
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:30,409
on this varies depending on which exact
model you get some other million go up

108
00:06:30,409 --> 00:06:33,419
and I hit wifi 2.4 gigahertz

109
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:37,549
I something fun in here I all the cell
bands

110
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:41,710
our coverage here and while most today
conversations are in cryptid muster the

111
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:42,469
data streams

112
00:06:42,469 --> 00:06:45,940
I you can pick up a whole bunch of the
signaling stuff and say oh

113
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,599
a new cell phones arrived ur you know
somebody's receiving a call

114
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,389
II and expecially right around camp
right now there's the GSM cell network

115
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:57,770
and that's actually being run on
software defined radios so

116
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,508
all the GSM work is being done on a
completely

117
00:07:01,509 --> 00:07:06,419
I off-the-shelf computer it's an open
source project called open BTS

118
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:09,758
Heights you could download this and be
running your own cell service

119
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:13,310
you should have a license if you doing
this or you can do it in a basement very

120
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,129
very very quiet

121
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,419
like are but go get a license with you

122
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:20,539
arm or metal shipping container

123
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:23,849
totally legal if you're in a metal
shipping container arm

124
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:28,039
to the best of my knowledge I am NOT a
lawyer et cetera to an american

125
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:31,729
on but arm

126
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:35,258
it has relatively poor performance but
honestly for fifteen pounds

127
00:07:35,259 --> 00:07:38,580
who cares on you can actually receive
GPS

128
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,179
I don't know how I don't know why magic

129
00:07:42,179 --> 00:07:45,989
lots have magic on but FM AM radios

130
00:07:45,989 --> 00:07:49,539
on pagers so if you're near a hospital
or something you can actually read

131
00:07:49,539 --> 00:07:52,610
pagers or near some business which

132
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:55,679
stories pagers on ATVs

133
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:59,669
is what airplanes used to report their
location so if you're near an airport

134
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:02,889
or just have airplanes flying over you
can actually

135
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:06,459
r load up a free piece of software and
trace the plane's

136
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,819
flying over you arm what's a good fun
our weather balloons like they've been

137
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:11,469
launching

138
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:14,569
you can track using this I satellites

139
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:18,379
yes you should gone by wannabes they're
a lot of fun

140
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:21,839
and yet like three coffees cell go do it

141
00:08:21,839 --> 00:08:25,490
I this is the expensive version

142
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:29,219
it's like six hundred dollars 400 pounds

143
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:33,289
I or more add by very very flexible

144
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:36,360
much higher quality and you can digitize
lots

145
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:40,250
stuff but once he could be receiving 30
40 50 different

146
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,429
voice conversation conversations
simultaneously

147
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,319
if your computer or support it and

148
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,090
and some card interface if you Rd
animate radio person already have a

149
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:51,740
scanner

150
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,310
you can often just connect arm an audio
cable from this

151
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:58,949
to your computer and get started with
the software I think

152
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,990
yes software on if you type in

153
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:05,050
SDR software defined radio software
it'll just

154
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:09,060
pull up this list for you also see if I
get that I

155
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,189
they'd get the slide posted somewhere on
the wiki or something

156
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:16,150
um but these are all free I and they're
kinda going

157
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:21,150
STR sharp is about the simplest when you
can download it does run cross platform

158
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,390
I don't know about Mac but on me

159
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:27,590
%ah

160
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,660
interesting I am on OSX

161
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,680
explicitly don't yeah

162
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,760
I well grab on the older versions then

163
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:40,720
they it does work fine I STR console

164
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,960
is really nice a me that might be
Windows and Mac only

165
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,470
on HD STR is fully open source

166
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:54,470
as is STR sharp actually arm sounds like
something really bad happened recently

167
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:59,070
I get new radios open source and its
cross-platform

168
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:02,750
and it's actually the most powerful one
arm and that's what a lot

169
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,940
universities use a research out but you
can use downloaded

170
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:09,000
and there are reasonable guides online
which

171
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,540
I think I have coming up next I it's so
this is what

172
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,380
any radio I looks like when you download
the graphical companion

173
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,680
and you can see we have a signal source
coming in and we filter it

174
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,739
and we look at an FFT which I think I

175
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,400
is just the way form that we are seeing
before showing intensity

176
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:31,260
I over frequency low-pass filtered again

177
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:34,279
stempel squelch so that we don't hear
just shy

178
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:37,540
all the time on do a

179
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,879
narrowband FM receive and

180
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:44,060
output out to the sound card and you can
receive

181
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:47,569
FM radio I and so again that's

182
00:10:47,569 --> 00:10:50,790
yeah says that looks like and this is
the FFT

183
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:54,860
down here siege get the nice output and
you're listening to radio

184
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:58,029
on it looks complicated but

185
00:10:58,029 --> 00:11:01,389
you can use it with one these tiny
little fifteen-pound tuners

186
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:05,769
it's a great way to get started arm and
you listen to all sorts of things

187
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:10,360
on YouTube videos yes there are lots of
YouTube videos

188
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,889
on covering the new radio covering

189
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:17,050
the RTL STR tuner which is the little
cheap dinner

190
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,800
arm what's resources online and its

191
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,349
just going to get bigger and bigger and
bigger because hardware is expensive to

192
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,029
modify

193
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,310
software is cheaper to modify arm ships

194
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,939
yes more resources after getting started
with iight signal processing

195
00:11:33,939 --> 00:11:38,160
so if the concept of discrete-time and
continuous-time signals completely new

196
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:38,569
to you

197
00:11:38,569 --> 00:11:42,459
I these top two web sites completely
explain it I

198
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:46,290
is a free text book on digital signal
processing arm

199
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:49,819
and and this is a dead pit a dead tree
book

200
00:11:49,819 --> 00:11:53,019
on but I its excellent

201
00:11:53,019 --> 00:11:56,620
you can pick up used copies very cheaply
and it's good fun

202
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:01,050
I thank you very much and I hope people
are interested in something find radio

203
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:01,939
books like that
