1
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,829
right thanks thanks very much thanks
everyone for coming out this talk

2
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,750
a.m. as that their minds are not great
I'm at you can say that but

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,460
museum your team is I'm education
technical specialist at

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,220
MathWorks and live like come here why my
area mapped

5
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:29,070
talk to you guys today well what I want
to do is uncertainty about robotics and

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:29,730
computer vision

7
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,260
and particularly using using all tools
MATLAB and Simulink

8
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,199
and somebody may be familiar this in
fact I'm gonna start with that

9
00:00:37,199 --> 00:00:40,690
can I see a show of hands for anybody
who knows what my love is

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:44,000
I was pretty good

11
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,020
a cow it's been too long introducing
Malibu and

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,510
how about similar does anybody know a
single against thats

13
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:56,260
that's a bit less but get right so I'll
start off by giving instruction set to

14
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:00,489
what this offer I'm talking about is and
then I'm basically gonna show you lots

15
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:01,010
demos

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:04,390
I'm it will be quite useful if you can
see screams

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,710
so if that's your only one you can say
you might wanna move so you can see the

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,229
plasmas

19
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,690
I'm it's not essential I'm logic and
talk about things but

20
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,920
they begin behind if you to see what I'm
actually doing with the software is

21
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,369
that's kinda the whole point to this
talk

22
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:20,340
I'm so some the demoss I'm gonna talk
about are image processing with

23
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,080
raspberry Pi

24
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:24,240
I am how you program out we know is
using Simulink

25
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:27,380
and how you do this guy hair done if you
can say I'm

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,089
is a little ass self-balancing Lego
robot talking heads in many

27
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:38,750
be stays upright I'll give him a break
for now they will come back to NY

28
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:41,790
so was mad well since

29
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:45,610
nice to be seem to know anyway I'll keep
this pretty quick and its is the leading

30
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,660
environment for for technical computing

31
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:52,110
I'm it's very very good at things like
mayor computation visualization

32
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,560
and its kind in the industry standard
for developing

33
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,490
engineering type and computing
algorithms and it's also the platform

34
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:02,030
for toolboxes

35
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,170
all all kinds so signal processing image
by saying talk a little bit about some

36
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:06,920
allies today

37
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:10,429
statistics optimization all kinds of
other stuff as well really

38
00:02:10,429 --> 00:02:15,650
and it's also kind of foundation product
if you like everything else sits on top

39
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:16,520
of MATLAB

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,550
I'm so even those you know a MATLAB is

41
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:24,209
sometimes question I get asked is what
on earth is technical computing

42
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:27,600
what's adds that differ from computing
well

43
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,930
this is just kinda of sort of high-level
overview of what we consider technical

44
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,780
computing today so it's basically

45
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,630
doing things with data so on the left
hand side you can say

46
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:40,940
accessing data thats the first thing you
need to do

47
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:44,850
in order to be able to do anything with
data and so once you access they see

48
00:02:44,850 --> 00:02:45,890
bring it into MATLAB

49
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:49,140
then you can start developing algorithms
you can start analyzing the data

50
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,600
without me creating visualizations great
to control systems whatever you might

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,209
wanna do

52
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:56,580
and but then finally it's quite
important that this basis of I can

53
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:57,390
actually be

54
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:00,518
sent out into the real world to actually
do things

55
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,420
I'm in this talk today I'm gonna talk
about how you actually

56
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:08,429
send that software onto robots on the
quad copters

57
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:12,709
onto various things robots basically and
as was the

58
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,860
the title the talk and I was gonna
switch into MATLAB now and show you

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:21,120
what mattered looks like but since most
people seem to know

60
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,730
and you'll see it very shortly anyway so
else get map a nap and we can fax a bit

61
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:27,420
more on the robotics and stuff instead

62
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,350
and now most people didn't raise their
hand when I asked if the bank knew what

63
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,070
similar calls

64
00:03:33,070 --> 00:03:37,350
Cyrus been a little bit more time on
this I'm simulate again it's one of

65
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,079
these products that

66
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:42,329
is within MATLAB and is the leading
environment for modeling and simulating

67
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,090
systems

68
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:43,849
I

69
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:46,828
and the kind important line on there
really is

70
00:03:46,829 --> 00:03:49,499
implementing systems as well
implementing dynamic and embedded

71
00:03:49,499 --> 00:03:50,280
systems

72
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:53,340
I'm and by that we mean

73
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,019
actually generating code download
compiling and downloading the code onto

74
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:01,980
real-world systems I'm and

75
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,768
this is just a small subset of people
who use

76
00:04:05,769 --> 00:04:10,310
similar for that purpose I'm of
everything from modeling the system so

77
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:12,980
you got helicopters on there you've got
buses you've got

78
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,389
diesel engines mobile phones ago kinda
stuff that people will model using all

79
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:17,910
tools

80
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:22,330
and then once they've done modeling and
say yes this

81
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,940
system does pretty much for expected
today let's put it on the actual

82
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,680
hardware

83
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:30,280
let's see how it performs on the actual
device and then they go often

84
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,460
production is that and sell millions of
the so thats

85
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:37,508
kinda have similar gets used action
industry appreciate you guys here

86
00:04:37,509 --> 00:04:38,419
probably arm

87
00:04:38,419 --> 00:04:41,909
all some might be our whole at an
industry so

88
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,889
all now gonna focus a bit more on have
this is useful for you guys

89
00:04:45,889 --> 00:04:49,389
and saw stuff actually just by showing
you what similar looks like

90
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,960
axle or the stuff I'm gonna be doing
from now on is is in Simulink

91
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,948
I'm hi spoke to

92
00:04:56,949 --> 00:05:00,409
spoken to quite a few people over the
course of this event I'm

93
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:03,729
mainly because have been fly McCourt
cupped around outside my tent just so

94
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:04,630
obviously not

95
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,219
and and everyone else be what it does
and my answer is

96
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,330
doesn't do much at the moment because
states quite

97
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:15,740
near it's got a new system that hasn't
been

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,169
fully developed yet so what I do have
instead of a fully developed autonomous

99
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:21,008
quadcopter

100
00:05:21,009 --> 00:05:24,180
I have a simulation of a fully developed
autonomous quadcopter

101
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:29,349
I'm going to use that to show you guys
exactly what similar case

102
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,389
so just letting that up now I'll just
take a moment but basically what this is

103
00:05:33,389 --> 00:05:34,860
is this is a virtual reality

104
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,770
simulation all what this little
quadcopter we'll see

105
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:43,198
in the real world so what this project
is it's a quadcopter that's got a camera

106
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:43,849
on the bottom

107
00:05:43,849 --> 00:05:47,699
it flies around it sees landmarks on the
ground

108
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:50,830
and uses those landmarks to determine
where it is in

109
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,890
Andrew wells is designed to fly around
in dole's so you can't use GPS for that

110
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,460
purpose

111
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:58,750
I'm so it's a vision-based is a vision
based system

112
00:05:58,750 --> 00:06:02,040
so this is well similar looks like this
is a

113
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,050
this is a fairly simple looking and
block diagram where you have a control

114
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:07,000
system in the middle

115
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,780
have you guys can all see my mass
alright control system in the middle

116
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,520
the simulation is here on the right hand
side and I've got us go pay which is

117
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,760
gonna show me what's happening

118
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,840
I'm what we're also gonna say because in
this simulation is actually quite a lot

119
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,479
of detail

120
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,700
what would also see Papa some virtual
reality views

121
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,979
where you can see the 3d world that this

122
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,460
simulated quadcopter is flying around it
and

123
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:33,479
so this is just building industry
running now this is all running at the

124
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:33,810
moment

125
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,830
on my local computer this is kinda West
similac started as the simulation till

126
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,900
so you can see this little windows but
to pay our country size that one

127
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,099
but what I can do these guys at this

128
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,610
so that showing

129
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:52,760
what the damn viewing camera on this
cock up to

130
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:56,390
would be seeing and you can see it's
marking little crosses on these little

131
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,599
targets that it's saying

132
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,430
and those crosses mean that the
quadcopter is positively identified that

133
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,720
target and is currently using it to
determine its own position

134
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:09,770
and and if I go to Skype said

135
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:13,799
these top two time histories Skype so
dislike

136
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,120
oscilloscopes would look like I ask
aunty showing $0 and 0

137
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,690
because the cop is coming at the origin
and I can go

138
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:24,820
and change where will the court got to
go into actually I want to go forward an

139
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:25,310
axe

140
00:07:25,310 --> 00:07:28,780
you can see the top scope there
representing the exposition in the quad

141
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,679
copter is now

142
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,650
is now increasing so this is behind the
scenes in all this there's a lotta mass

143
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:34,429
there's a lot of

144
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:37,530
physical modeling has lotsa simulation
tools

145
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:41,479
and and what I wanna say what I wanna
show you now

146
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,580
out is that this is what happens in any
case a I've given you

147
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,719
very quick very brief introduction to
what is my body similar

148
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,070
but actually how can you use these to
connect to

149
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:54,200
raspberry PIs to yeah are going out on a

150
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:58,330
aminos and to let go and things like
that how can you actually use the power

151
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:00,300
of these tools to program these devices

152
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:03,540
so I'm gonna switch back to MATLAB and
I'm

153
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,540
now that you guys are all familiar with
similar ok

154
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:11,080
and and I'm going to

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:16,210
show you just go the presentation to
give some context

156
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:21,210
and

157
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,070
summit talk about the the different ways
in which you can connect low-cost

158
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,540
hardware

159
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:28,440
with with madeleine simplex look back at
me me to slide you can call any things

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,320
on that slide

161
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:33,010
particularly low cost so if you happen
to own helicopter

162
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:36,429
you might go but my opinion do something
with it but don't think most

163
00:08:36,429 --> 00:08:39,978
day and phones is the annex that
exception probably and will will come

164
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:43,120
we'll come back to that show but so if
you've got mud and cement on your

165
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,370
computer and you want to run it on a PC
apiece

166
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:49,300
harbor well firstly you can go to our
website and download public support

167
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:51,079
packages which are freely available

168
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,700
tolls once you have MATLAB and Simulink
you can download these Adams that a

169
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:55,490
freely available

170
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:58,730
for the specific hardware you want so
for example Raspberry Pi

171
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:02,610
Lego Mindstorms et cetera we have we
have quite large number these packages

172
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,570
now so once you've installed those

173
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,390
you get two different approaches you can
use the first is

174
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:13,030
data riot so getting data inactive
MATLAB from a device

175
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:17,339
I'm this might be in this case I'm gonna
talk about today

176
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:20,710
when I'm designing the image processing
algorithms I want to run

177
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:24,170
on this quadcopter I want to see what
the quad copters actually same

178
00:09:24,170 --> 00:09:28,310
I want to get an image of other Occupy
camera I wanna see what it sees and I

179
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,719
want to work with atrial image

180
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,920
because I can only do so much with my
virtual reality because that's not real

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,650
that's not real data I'm so this allows
me to develop all my organs in mouth on

182
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:38,470
my computer

183
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:42,990
but using a real device to communicate
with the world once I've actually

184
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,350
got all my other items developed a
probably what's disconnected from

185
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,850
my computer I don't wanna be dependent
on MATLAB running on

186
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,149
laptop constantly have to change my quad
copter and I

187
00:09:52,149 --> 00:09:55,649
I want it to be able to go off and just
do its own thing and not rely on me any

188
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:57,959
more particulars and trying to design an
autonomous system

189
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,800
and so this is our second approach which
is where we actually target the harbor

190
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:06,099
so active Simulink press a couple
buttons and it just goes and create some

191
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:06,790
C code

192
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:10,630
compiles that downloads and runs it on
your device and

193
00:10:10,630 --> 00:10:14,689
it really is quite straightforward
process also you also you both these two

194
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:19,009
approaches net so gonna show you the
Raspberry Pi support for Matlab

195
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,630
all the maps corporate bonds slides that
and

196
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:25,740
this workflow

197
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:29,709
is very similar ugly nose a Lego for all
sorts of stuff I'm

198
00:10:29,709 --> 00:10:34,189
is just to have a good example of the
the Raspberry Pi I'm here today so

199
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:39,019
the Support Package that we provide give
you access to GP II's early days all the

200
00:10:39,019 --> 00:10:42,519
things on that list that the 1 I'm gonna
use 1 I'm gonna show you the camera

201
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:46,310
because that's what my little a
quadcopter friend is doing it so

202
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:50,050
once again back to MATLAB to make sure
I'm connected to

203
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:53,709
so I'm just reading a wireless
connection to cook up to its go wireless

204
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:56,339
access point running on board I need to
be connected to that

205
00:10:56,339 --> 00:11:03,339
to actually interface with the with the
harbor

206
00:11:04,190 --> 00:11:07,130
for those of you not familiar with
MATLAB this is Matt what code

207
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:11,620
and its pretty straight forward I'm not
expecting you to read every line this is

208
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:12,870
a go through just vaguely

209
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:17,170
see what's happening and the kinda main
point really want to get across is just

210
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:20,800
how little code is needed to do these
various things so

211
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,500
that first section of code those first
two lines the crack my pie in my camp

212
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:32,500
just do exactly that created connection
to the Raspberry Pi

213
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:45,050
which doesn't seem to be working

214
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,260
though

215
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,360
that

216
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,640
still running similar at the time and
soviet so I just pulled in

217
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,089
an image story of the Raspberry Pi
camera to prove that that is a real

218
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:07,529
image

219
00:12:07,529 --> 00:12:10,790
them that runs is not running live and
is pulled a single image will get to

220
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,860
running live in a minute but just turned
around slightly and he say

221
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:18,160
mag another image in know what I want to
do this is the premise pricing algorithm

222
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:18,990
I want to develop

223
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:23,300
I want to detect that blue object and i
wanna see where it is

224
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,810
in the image and what orientation it's
at and

225
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:30,420
so the first thing you might think well
images are made up of red green and blue

226
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,069
that's how they're represents the MATLAB
is as big matrices and select select out

227
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:37,410
the red green and blue channels and see
what they look like

228
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,880
and may can see from that you look at
the blue channel

229
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,980
you can't really detect the object at
all and if you think about it

230
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:48,970
that's because white also has a lot to
blow it I mean white is

231
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,180
basically all red green and blue and so
we just found very very quickly

232
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:56,890
we have had a real idk how to find the
figure this out responded very quickly

233
00:12:56,890 --> 00:12:58,880
that the practice saying let's look at
low

234
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,890
is not useful I'm so

235
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:06,230
let's try implementing this equation
here where we basically say we only one

236
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,870
blow so let's look at the blue channel
and subtract red

237
00:13:08,870 --> 00:13:12,740
and grain to get creative white from our
area of interest

238
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,579
actually actually do something a bit
more interesting I don't know what the

239
00:13:15,579 --> 00:13:17,020
contrast like on your screen but

240
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:20,079
you can see a little gray object here

241
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,279
which is the blow that we won't attack
and now that will have certain values

242
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,240
associated with the intensity of blow
which we can figure out this by clicking

243
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,089
on this little danger inspector here

244
00:13:30,089 --> 00:13:34,089
and saying I and II has a blue value up
74 whatever that means

245
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:37,100
and but actually we just wanna know is
it lowers it not like

246
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:41,899
women are interested in is it 74 blues
we don't really care about that so

247
00:13:41,899 --> 00:13:44,820
we can do that simply by picking a
threshold in saying is above a certain

248
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,450
threshold

249
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,459
so got a special to 100 here that's not
gonna work

250
00:13:48,459 --> 00:13:51,649
so this image on the right says no
there's nothing blowing that image

251
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:53,399
there's nothing to blow up more than a
hundred

252
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:58,610
so drop that something a bit more
reasonable 50

253
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:01,430
they a so we've now identified that's
not blown

254
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:04,459
over there but that is below

255
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:08,709
ida so that hasn't taken much code to
implement not really

256
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:12,920
that's what maybe twenty lines a coating
of that actually visualizing what's

257
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,378
going on

258
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,170
and but then the interesting but as we
can actually call

259
00:14:17,170 --> 00:14:21,069
one other functions from our image
processing toolbox which

260
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:25,429
well look at that Butler

261
00:14:25,429 --> 00:14:28,540
nicest thing my so again I don't know
how good this is

262
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:32,779
on your screens tronic another big and
deviancy on this right and image now

263
00:14:32,779 --> 00:14:35,079
we've actually called a tool called the
blood analysis

264
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,498
I'm told which allows us to look at
binary image

265
00:14:39,499 --> 00:14:42,949
ones and zeros and say okay where is the
center

266
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,290
the object in the Senate where is the
center of the ones in this image

267
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:49,660
and also what angle is this at

268
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,868
in the image so what we've done now is
everything that we wanted a week now on

269
00:14:53,869 --> 00:14:57,629
we once did detect where these images
we're sorry where this item is in the

270
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:58,009
image:

271
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,259
and we've done that now that's one of
the done on a static image that's not

272
00:15:01,259 --> 00:15:02,420
particularly exciting

273
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:05,839
let's try actually running this knack

274
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:09,470
continuously some running this in a lake
and if I

275
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:14,509
back to cook up dropping to the ground
you can see on the right hand side to

276
00:15:14,509 --> 00:15:17,600
plotting a graph where the target is in
the image:

277
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,370
and if I wrote echoed got to so the
anger at the court got the relative to

278
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:22,040
the target

279
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,410
is that large arrow as well and

280
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:28,749
and even say I'm doing all this in
developing or this code on my face a

281
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:32,360
but I'm interfacing with the actual real
system with the railroad depot itself

282
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,499
and

283
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:37,110
so that is connection between

284
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:41,440
MATLAB and

285
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,570
altered by is gonna reset this guy so
he's ready for later on

286
00:15:44,570 --> 00:15:50,920
okay so

287
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:55,110
that kind of shown you a quick example

288
00:15:55,110 --> 00:16:02,110
of this first workflow that I talked
about welcome

289
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:10,230
on this so love using MATLAB for
potential acquisition

290
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,490
I'm I didn't show you actually doing any
actuation

291
00:16:13,490 --> 00:16:17,370
and if you had GPIO is connected to the
Raspberry Pi yucatan attendees on things

292
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,140
like that again just using

293
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,720
tools that we provide well talk for a
bit now

294
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,210
is actually how you target harvests are
you actually take a similar

295
00:16:26,210 --> 00:16:30,080
model and download and run it on a piece
of hardware I am

296
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,640
so again

297
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:37,180
much like a MATLAB support we have a
huge number of targets that we support

298
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,380
you can get numbers free add-ons within
MATLAB

299
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,800
I'm and one's I'm gonna shades Days
Festival the

300
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,800
on being a mega not a very exciting demo
it's turning an early day on

301
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,719
but its sufficiently simple that I can
actually build a model in front of you

302
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:53,450
and show you the actual process and
quite how straightforward as

303
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,210
and then something a little bit more
complicated I'm not gonna talk to detail

304
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,960
of but controlling

305
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:02,150
a self-balancing Lego Mindstorms robot

306
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:06,069
and spoken to some people over the
course of the event so far who

307
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,939
they've been playing around with Lego
NXT robots and who rolled slightly

308
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:13,040
amazed that you can actually bank a
self-balancing robot because their

309
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,310
experience with them was

310
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:17,050
that new you can't breathe the census
fast enough for you can't connect to

311
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,349
make this quick enough or whatever

312
00:17:18,349 --> 00:17:23,040
and but actually using similar except to
program it you you most certainly can

313
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:27,720
I'm so I'll I'll show you that towards
the end so

314
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:32,460
what's get back into MATLAB

315
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,130
go

316
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:40,260
and the reason up close them out and
opening up scratches to show you I'm not

317
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:40,850
cheating

318
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:44,830
I am gonna create completely from
scratch a

319
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:49,250
new model that's gonna run on this road
trip by and Shea summit site personal

320
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:49,610
stripper

321
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,689
on this Audrey now and show you some of
the interesting and the interesting

322
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:53,500
things along the way

323
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,669
so this is the Adams many respect
whether for

324
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,510
I'm you go click on Add ons gather
support packages

325
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,049
and you click through a few men using a
holistic hardware that but we can target

326
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:07,260
and but I've already installed a less on
gonna get trapped

327
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,390
takes about 10 minutes so was gonna grab
some unique

328
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:15,510
and again I showed you that similarly
revenue model I'd already created that

329
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,760
was very complicated at

330
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:20,789
but a reality and all sorts of stuff and
but this I'm just going to anyone

331
00:18:20,789 --> 00:18:25,860
so exempt there's nothing in it I can
run that now nothing happened I'm

332
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:29,080
when I run the model before and if I run
this model now

333
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,230
it'll run on what they say now that's
not what I want so

334
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,279
the first thing I have to do is tell it
that I want to run on some target harbor

335
00:18:37,279 --> 00:18:44,279
and that target is no bueno so have to
tell about

336
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,280
so that brings up a menu and a moment
yet so tell you how to raise coming on

337
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,460
and therefore it will run on my local
machine but i wanna do that

338
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:56,169
I wanna run it on another in a you can
see the less terrible the Packers I've

339
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:56,830
installed

340
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,020
there is a there is a much bigger list
if you hit get more you get that same

341
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,090
menu I showed you go

342
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,000
and but I want to run on another in a
mega this is gonna give me some

343
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:08,750
additional options now and where I can
choose various

344
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:13,330
I'm default setting so anyone familiar
programming out reno's

345
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:16,990
you can set board right some things you
can set your analog voltage in a less

346
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:20,659
I about I know I'm just gonna leave all
about as default

347
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm what you also get rather than just
that

348
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,429
interesting little drop down menu when
you install the Support Package you also

349
00:19:28,429 --> 00:19:28,990
get

350
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,320
some additional tools that you can
include in your model

351
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:37,480
so I charge a model before had some
scope Senate had some constants in

352
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,000
had some subsystems and had lots of
things that were connected I'm

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,080
but to connect to an army know you
actually want to

354
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:47,428
control pins on Audrina I'm will read
data from an ongoing a

355
00:19:47,429 --> 00:19:50,919
so you need some specific blocks for
that so

356
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,870
I'm gonna use data in the ditch limber
and each lap blocks

357
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:58,049
again you can see this is going to be
very simple example

358
00:19:58,049 --> 00:20:00,629
and

359
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:05,090
switches on 7 my early day

360
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:09,189
is on attack to wander in their selling
it what pins things are connected to

361
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:12,260
and I also want them all to run forever

362
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,260
by default things on Iran 10 seconds
usually simulating a system that you

363
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,080
just take my real

364
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,800
and I'm gonna say lets the ploy that to
my other and this'll take just a minute

365
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:24,820
it's now generating some C code calling

366
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:28,050
various parts of the art we know I D A
and and

367
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,230
downloading and running this code on
here I'm

368
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:35,060
and you say when it runs that that was

369
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,080
all very interesting press about Miley
they'll come on when it's running

370
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,030
I'm but there is something more
interesting which I can show you in a

371
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:42,379
moment

372
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:49,380
that didn't work mineral home

373
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,799
stand

374
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,570
and

375
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,049
so I can say this is downloading C code
and running on the other we know

376
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:06,660
I'm which you can do if you know say
your sickness plus it is you can do

377
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,179
from the Army no ID like quite as easily
as well too terminally Dale

378
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:13,929
I'm the one thing that is this very
powerful about developing these kind of

379
00:21:13,929 --> 00:21:14,960
things but in Simulink

380
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,980
is actually once i download and run my
code on the subway now

381
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,350
I can keep my Simulink model connected
to the Arduino

382
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:26,059
and modify certain aspects about code
while the code is running

383
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:30,990
I'm and so

384
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:34,600
you guys for recounts a but when I press
the button

385
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
analytical now the fact you can say is
that you get because it means that I can

386
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:41,790
demonstrate this next think that I was
just alluding to that

387
00:21:41,790 --> 00:21:46,320
I'm I can keep Simulink connected to
mild winter while the code is running

388
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:51,280
so I can say actually okay I wanna lady
to come on but I also wanna record

389
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,160
overtime how many times the banners the
buttons being pressed

390
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:58,870
all if somebody's currently holding the
button down or something now if I was to

391
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,678
hit that button and deployed to the
hardware again that wouldn't help

392
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:03,700
because there's no screen on here
there's no way

393
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:08,230
me physically seeing 8 sky over time
history what I can select

394
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:12,309
from this little drop down menu here is
I select to run an external mic what

395
00:22:12,309 --> 00:22:13,460
external mode says

396
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:16,570
is okay I'm gonna do what you asked me
to do before I'm gonna

397
00:22:16,570 --> 00:22:20,770
great legacy code and download and run
an odd way but in case not going I'm

398
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,889
also gonna build in

399
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:25,740
a serial connection and I'm not gonna
ask you any details on this was gonna do

400
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,690
in the background I'm in a building a
serial connection which says if you have

401
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:29,910
any things in your model

402
00:22:29,910 --> 00:22:33,710
that represent interaction with that
with a user

403
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,429
I E a scope in this case to show you
what's happening and

404
00:22:37,429 --> 00:22:40,730
I'm gonna request that the code that I
build send back data back

405
00:22:40,730 --> 00:22:44,179
constantly I'm so that you can this so
that you can

406
00:22:44,179 --> 00:22:48,360
see it and and interact with in Semitic
in the same way you would if you're

407
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,820
selling model was running on your
desktop

408
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:53,010
like when I was showing you the virtual
reality example before

409
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:56,400
so this is now running again when I
press the button

410
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,919
the lady comes on as was very exciting
before but now

411
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,120
I can also open at this company can see
their with big boy

412
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,409
that when I press the button you can see

413
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:12,400
that signal going high to say

414
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,309
actually his own band and now is now
nizar in but now

415
00:23:16,309 --> 00:23:19,100
and you can imagine you can do a lot
more exciting things than just talking

416
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:19,689
about them

417
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:23,030
but I'm this was something that I could
build very quickly and show you

418
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:27,720
right here now so the final thing I want
show

419
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,260
as I alluded to was

420
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:34,580
not just something very simple running
on another enact something a little bit

421
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,139
more complicated running on some like a

422
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:39,650
so was never get to this

423
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:43,910
this lighting up so I've already done

424
00:23:43,910 --> 00:23:47,110
on this Lego is I've already downloaded
some code in a way I did in the first

425
00:23:47,110 --> 00:23:48,490
instance with the

426
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:53,120
are doing I'm I'm which will

427
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:56,229
just run when I sent it to run

428
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:02,190
analyst run their in the background and
balance moreover

429
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,090
but that's not connected similac so I've
got some things in a document control

430
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,928
for example I can tell I want to move
forwards are want to turn

431
00:24:08,929 --> 00:24:11,490
but these two are not currently
connected because when I did that

432
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:15,860
download I didn't use external mic so
I'm gonna do now is actually

433
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:20,540
download again with external mode
selected

434
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:23,909
and the real benefit with the like a
hardware

435
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,420
is that built into this

436
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,690
is a Bluetooth device so

437
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,920
the external no connection when you use
Lego is not the USB cable

438
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
I'm using USB to download the model cuz
that much faster than using

439
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:41,890
lichte butts and it's not say USB
connection to actually

440
00:24:41,890 --> 00:24:45,880
have the external mic feedback because
I'd be quite useless if you've got a

441
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:47,580
little robot you want to drive around

442
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:51,790
you don't want to be connected to laptop
over USB so once this model's download

443
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:52,428
and run

444
00:24:52,429 --> 00:24:56,850
it'll actually be communicating and a
Bluetooth and I'll be able to have it

445
00:24:56,850 --> 00:24:58,550
hopefully driving up and down the stage
in

446
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:02,370
probably falling off the end of
something out in a and but I guess is

447
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:09,370
almost done that in essence is
disconnecting

448
00:25:09,429 --> 00:25:12,649
K mission K

449
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:18,059
so the first thing I did today is
calibrate the gyroscope

450
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:22,279
just by pressing a button tell us what I
wanna date and holding it up right now

451
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:22,789
is running

452
00:25:22,789 --> 00:25:28,019
and I can coming to hear

453
00:25:28,019 --> 00:25:31,969
and show you this services a scope again

454
00:25:31,969 --> 00:25:35,070
appreciate Michael be the easiest thing
to say on your screens but it's a time

455
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,509
history so it shows over time

456
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:40,139
whether robot thinks he's at in terms of
the angle

457
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,299
but the robot is sitting at and

458
00:25:43,299 --> 00:25:45,619
so that might be quite use with your
friends on a control system is quite

459
00:25:45,619 --> 00:25:47,718
useful to have this information
available to you

460
00:25:47,719 --> 00:25:51,869
and but also it means I can take control
him

461
00:25:51,869 --> 00:25:56,119
so I can say I've got these two targets
these demands going into my control

462
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:56,570
system

463
00:25:56,570 --> 00:26:01,019
so that's demand the image coat now
forget

464
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:06,190
I'm and I can making a bit faster and
helps keep driving

465
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:11,789
I'm and I can make in turn I left I want
to go as possible things you can see him

466
00:26:11,789 --> 00:26:12,479
again same

467
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:19,479
not be goes over them Maria now it's
making turns well

468
00:26:19,690 --> 00:26:21,579
as an hour is gonna jump from the stage

469
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:25,589
let's turn back the other way has not
been up to

470
00:26:25,589 --> 00:26:29,329
Boston with know is that Otis

471
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:33,309
is by less less lame walk away and then
come back to me and

472
00:26:33,309 --> 00:26:40,309
so going in the past

473
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:46,659
nightgown I

474
00:26:46,659 --> 00:26:46,990
but

475
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:51,340
you get the idea I'm I couldn't I could
have been changing things that weren't

476
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:51,840
just

477
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:55,980
Constance leading into a thing I've got
I wasn't going to the senate because I

478
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,090
appreciate you guys for being all
control systems design is and

479
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:01,629
but we we do this kind of thing at
universities we do these kind of

480
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:02,480
workshops with

481
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,070
with control engineers and we would get
them to actually go in optimize the GSE

482
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:09,740
the the controller on the device and

483
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:12,389
which you can do in real time on things
running you don't have to keep

484
00:27:12,389 --> 00:27:14,149
rebuilding and redownloading Yoko

485
00:27:14,149 --> 00:27:19,428
which is really really quite powerful
I'm quite powerful system to have so

486
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:22,889
that saw them as I wanted to show you
I'll just

487
00:27:22,889 --> 00:27:26,559
wrap up and then by any questions so

488
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:30,100
why my actually here talking to you guys
a that they amassed I'm

489
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:33,860
well for a long time if you 12 students

490
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:37,519
it was quite happy to get access to to
our products it to Mauer

491
00:27:37,519 --> 00:27:41,600
and because we haven't we had a a price
point that was aimed at students to

492
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,860
renew every student would need to know
it if you've

493
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,879
done in engineering course problem is to
be no matter because you done in

494
00:27:47,879 --> 00:27:50,248
engineering also had some affiliation
with somebody that had

495
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:53,299
because its is the tool that is used by
engineers

496
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,720
I'm so you probably experienced at
university but

497
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:00,169
if you if you want a student or if you
finish being used in going to a

498
00:28:00,169 --> 00:28:01,470
different failed or if you just

499
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:04,860
had an interest in doing some of these
kinda things we didn't have any way of

500
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,719
giving you access

501
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,679
we now do new new for 2014 we brought
out my

502
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:13,690
home which is for 385 pounds you can
have

503
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:17,409
all the capabilities map for doing the
various things that

504
00:28:17,409 --> 00:28:21,080
that I've just been talking about here
and and then all the different tool

505
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,408
boxes you can you can get as add-ons to
that and say you customize exactly what

506
00:28:25,409 --> 00:28:26,200
it is you need

507
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:30,049
I'm so that's why I'm here talking to
you guys because

508
00:28:30,049 --> 00:28:34,539
I do list kind of stuff for fun anyway
and I know that I couldn't do half this

509
00:28:34,539 --> 00:28:35,009
stuff

510
00:28:35,009 --> 00:28:39,740
without valid and Simulink because
coding half the stuff my hand is just

511
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,169
really difficult I'm so I know happy to
convey

512
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:46,730
and I just want to make love you guys
aware that it's out there

513
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,520
you can use it there's lotsa resources
as well that we have we have is make his

514
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:51,220
own blog

515
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:56,210
I'm which is aimed at students and make
is it's not aimed at the people in

516
00:28:56,210 --> 00:28:57,659
industry making planes in

517
00:28:57,659 --> 00:29:01,120
causing all sorts of things it's aimed
at you can you guys building robots and

518
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:01,789
stuff like that

519
00:29:01,789 --> 00:29:04,870
I'm going call a blog post on that
moments during my quad copter in all

520
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:05,299
this

521
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:08,658
I'm so just wrap up their

522
00:29:08,659 --> 00:29:11,789
while I'm out and Simulink well you guys
pretty much knew that anyway

523
00:29:11,789 --> 00:29:15,960
and connecting connecting into hardware
you can get all the benefits all the

524
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:16,500
power

525
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,820
all those tools into your hardware-based
robotics and pricing

526
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,620
whatever the project maybe I'm we got
this new model at home

527
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:27,629
2014 so if anything you've seen here

528
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:31,720
is an interest you can now go away
actually to try this yourself

529
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,470
and and a is make his own we have a
whole website for a tutorial zan all

530
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,149
kinds of things

531
00:29:37,149 --> 00:29:40,389
there's a lot of resources out there to
get you up and running to get you

532
00:29:40,390 --> 00:29:41,679
started so

533
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:45,340
thank you for coming along thank you for
for putting up with berries demos

534
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:46,080
hard-working

535
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,210
and and the poor screen and everything
and I'd like to invite

536
00:29:50,210 --> 00:29:57,210
any questions thanks

537
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,100
yep like the mic

538
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:08,519
but what does the

539
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:12,039
85 Pam packaged do not do that before
Pakistan's

540
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,450
the 85 pounds is for map

541
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,700
I can so summer the image processing
stuff that I showed you with the

542
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:20,570
quadcopter and all that you could do

543
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,350
some of that stuff and if you want to
use a lot of the features in the image

544
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,830
processing toolbox here are some really
advanced stuff

545
00:30:26,830 --> 00:30:29,889
that's a 25-pound add-on and Simulink

546
00:30:29,889 --> 00:30:33,149
Simulink is an add-on also to

547
00:30:33,149 --> 00:30:36,439
is that you have to pay 25% chance to
get some meaning yes back

548
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:41,779
yeah tokars depending on what you're
doing if you're doing after districts

549
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,320
project for example you don't eat
anything

550
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:47,450
so if we included all in priced it so
had everything in it they would

551
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:50,860
and %uh probably costing a bit more so
we give you the option to to choose what

552
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:51,229
you need

553
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:58,230
anything else

554
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:01,629
so but the badges that we have are

555
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:05,650
East sensually Arduino do is yeah arm
how hard is it

556
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:09,510
to create a custom hardware you know a
constant target

557
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:12,730
I will we support the other you know
doing so

558
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,950
you could you could code the badges from

559
00:31:15,950 --> 00:31:19,880
sinning directly you wouldn't have the
the of sauce

560
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:23,440
there running in the back in Yuba County
it simply has not been a

561
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:27,720
I'm but i cud the add-on sensors and
stuff like that

562
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:31,150
I mean I always felt a rush hour reading
on yet writing a custom devices

563
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,299
I'm I didn't include I in this talk I
want to get a demagogue but

564
00:31:34,299 --> 00:31:38,280
but actually a few if you've got some C
code and

565
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:42,200
then you can include I know sinning
model relatively straightforward and we

566
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:48,669
do have a tutorial on our site shown yet

567
00:31:48,669 --> 00:31:50,480
yes

568
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,609
making a run but X I

569
00:31:56,609 --> 00:32:00,369
and I i and so what granularity cannot
go down to

570
00:32:00,369 --> 00:32:03,590
so for example can you model magnetic
fields

571
00:32:03,590 --> 00:32:06,749
and the probe set NMR spectroscopy in

572
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:11,759
is that I work in industry me yeah you
could model anything that anything

573
00:32:11,759 --> 00:32:15,909
virtually anything anything anything
that has a mass behind and you can mom

574
00:32:15,909 --> 00:32:19,299
billion pages complete is completely up
to you you can but you can but anything

575
00:32:19,299 --> 00:32:22,399
in there to amass in Matlab or
inseminate depending on how you want the

576
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,158
system to

577
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,080
to be represented and

578
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,960
we have tolls in a lot in areas that
will help you model things

579
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,849
and which just makes makes getting
started a little bit easier even if we

580
00:32:34,849 --> 00:32:36,939
don't have a particular toll in
particular area

581
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:39,539
you might have to have it will work
itself but I love the all the

582
00:32:39,539 --> 00:32:41,029
capabilities that a Muslim

583
00:32:41,029 --> 00:32:45,929
back this might be a bit on related but
do you think I'm ugly nose or Lego

584
00:32:45,929 --> 00:32:47,479
Mindstorms would be arm

585
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:51,690
capable of doing image processing my
face recognition with Matt not

586
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:55,659
I would say it's unlikely

587
00:32:55,659 --> 00:33:00,049
yeah but certainly the new Lego
Mindstorms

588
00:33:00,049 --> 00:33:05,830
the bb3 I am not quite sure you get an
image onto it and if it has a camera

589
00:33:05,830 --> 00:33:09,649
cabinet as a USB port so maybe but that
fundamentally it's very similar hardware

590
00:33:09,649 --> 00:33:10,418
to run because

591
00:33:10,419 --> 00:33:15,320
so to possibly I would say is the answer
to that certainly you can put

592
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,158
image processing things on it and see
what happens that there's nothing out

593
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:19,330
all the stops you doing

594
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,668
whether it will run on our whether it's
got the memory in the

595
00:33:22,669 --> 00:33:27,869
CPU capacity to actually do it i'd don't
know but you can certainly try

596
00:33:27,869 --> 00:33:32,228
there be any way that to beam it back to
telemetry or whatever

597
00:33:32,229 --> 00:33:35,389
to person on your computer or tear
producer

598
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:38,779
customs in a public figure racin on the
quad copter yes

599
00:33:38,779 --> 00:33:40,080
I

600
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,310
if you if you're deploying things to it
using using Simulink you've got waxed on

601
00:33:43,310 --> 00:33:44,700
my connection if you want to use that

602
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:48,520
but you can also building your own
connections so for example for the

603
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:49,639
support the Raspberry Pi

604
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:55,040
we have blocks for sending data over
Ethernet and that can be wireless

605
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:55,560
internet

606
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,810
or why did the net or whatever the same
with the other thing is that if you've

607
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:00,379
got any financial fear of doing a

608
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:04,170
you can send a two-out ivory finna to
any other device that you might want is

609
00:34:04,170 --> 00:34:04,960
that could be

610
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,800
MATLAB running on your on your laptop
and or it could be another device so you

611
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:09,980
could have been out we know

612
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:13,120
acquiring some data and actually
processing on iraq because

613
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,418
that would work fine you could cuddle up
that from from civic

614
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:20,158
I can excellent thanks correct one
behind

615
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,640
how much image processing can you got

616
00:34:23,639 --> 00:34:26,870
way with on the a robbery by I'm

617
00:34:26,870 --> 00:34:32,299
a surprising amount but obviously not
everything not everything that you can

618
00:34:32,300 --> 00:34:32,970
do

619
00:34:32,969 --> 00:34:36,790
on on a desktop mission but and

620
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:40,250
you can do quite a bit I mean

621
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:44,429
why should you there the detecting the
the angles and all this other stuff

622
00:34:44,429 --> 00:34:48,760
it'll run that no from and run that's
think we're running at 10 hurts which is

623
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:49,560
sufficient for

624
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:53,699
actually control a quote and if you just
wanted to detect

625
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:57,109
is is they're blue in the image of
something much simpler like that back at

626
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:58,520
probably run at full right at that

627
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,830
that offender sex so yeah you can't do

628
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:05,250
a huge amount but that's a limitation up
the harbour I'm

629
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:08,800
our see if you can drop the resolution
you can you can you can help things

630
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:14,610
massively

631
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:18,780
what happens a supported I it's a very
long list

632
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,860
and I see are using Windows but

633
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:25,310
oh sorry those I saw it I thought might
have about them and

634
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:29,240
different support packages are supported
on different platforms

635
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,990
we do fundamentally support Linux Mac
and Windows

636
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:36,979
MATLAB will run on police battled
whether the harbour support packages are

637
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,940
available on all those platforms you
have to look at individual packages

638
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:43,540
weeks we can sometimes have kinda
staggered development things were maybe

639
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:46,810
will really something for Windows and at
the next release you get Mac invincible

640
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:50,180
or family randall with seven sacks for
the individual hardware

641
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:54,020
support its its old the tell our website
but fundamentally balancing

642
00:35:54,020 --> 00:36:00,400
run on on this but the three magical

643
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,050
okay

644
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,040
thing that might feel with a simple
questions who

645
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,750
because I keep I cannot
