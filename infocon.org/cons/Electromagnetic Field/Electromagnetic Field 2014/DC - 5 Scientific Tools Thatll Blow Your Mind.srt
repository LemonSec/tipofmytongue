1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,180
I but for now I shall stop

2
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,450
lynch's DC his Kft a talk on five

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,780
scientific tools felt like a month cool

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,100
by Ivan thanks for coming am

5
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:26,000
so I'm gonna be talking about today is I
am screen for Acer basically

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Libya where does this come from like so
Lima giving this talk

7
00:00:34,289 --> 00:00:35,970
leading into mass spec

8
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:37,050
then cover

9
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,110
Asian gene activity heading on to grab
him it is

10
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:43,190
I a measuring graphically and then
finally finishing up with atomic force

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,910
microscopes

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:46,500
there

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,140
so

14
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:50,300
this come from I can only work in IT but
when I was young and needed the money I

15
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,709
did a PHD in genetics

16
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,780
I I did a lot of techniques for this I'm

17
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,780
I definitely have seen the the xkcd
comic and the best thesis defense is a

18
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,899
good pieces offense

19
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:03,540
so in a PhD and you have in the UK
anyway have

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,250
to experts who they try and pick holes
in all the work you've done and I knew

21
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,759
that one of the guys who is going to be

22
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:11,940
assessing me he like to treat people up
on how techniques worked

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:15,220
so I spend the whole PST whenever I came
across a penny just learning exactly how

24
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,070
it works because

25
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,570
I knew it would help me again so that's
where this comes from affect me just a

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,520
fascination with all these nowhere
techniques

27
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,110
I'm disclaimer am it's been awhile since
I've done

28
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,520
sign sing professionally so there's a
lot of these techniques which are may be

29
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,600
a bit old in the cool kids are doing
funky new things so

30
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,210
yet disclaimer that these the ones I
worked with not necessarily will stay

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:34,678
the out

32
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:37,720
okay so first off NMR

33
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:42,000
and you may know mr. from such hospitals
as at MRI machines

34
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,810
so these admissions that produce the
kind of very cool a

35
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:49,210
live scams our bodies we can see the
brain and all the organs things

36
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:53,158
these are based on and mr. nuclear
magnetic resonance

37
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:56,759
and go talked about how it works because
its freaking incredible

38
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,890
basically it works with aliens its

39
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:02,990
it's magic so this this was the machine

40
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,770
for those who got the actual monitor
this is my machine which introduced me

41
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:06,500
to NMR

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,919
at the time it was must have won the UK
and its it was pretty cool

43
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,190
I'm the health and safety briefing for
this machine with

44
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:17,200
simply epic so I was told at stake with
a metal off because it contains a giant

45
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,790
Magna and I went through let one thing
with a

46
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,120
a metal detector to check and nothing on
me because they had they have a case

47
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,600
with another machine where

48
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,980
a guy it got shoes with traditional I
and nails in

49
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:31,359
and him realize this 3 taken rusted
metal of them anywhere near the machine

50
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,920
it with the iron nails through is

51
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:36,958
but through the shoe and onto the
machine the magnets these things are

52
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:38,860
dealing with a truly incredible so

53
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:42,560
yeah best bet health and safety
demonstration ever I'm

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:46,120
say about this and mr. MRI was invented
in the forties

55
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,549
and I I'd say yeah but the common way
you know is is hospitals how does it

56
00:02:49,549 --> 00:02:50,040
work

57
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,620
I'm it is literally the hardest part a
math physics chemistry and biology in

58
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,400
one topic

59
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,650
it's probably the most interdisciplinary
topic I've ever come across

60
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:00,280
its it's incredible how it wasn't

61
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,460
did I I know their complete massive
respect for the people in both

62
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:07,270
the First Quantum Physics I'm okay
contem-

63
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,910
everything is spinning so atoms have
perhaps been and their two types has

64
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,690
been the importance the first is nuclear
spin which is the spin of the protons

65
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:15,359
and neutrons

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,220
and the need to electron expand which is
the spin of electrons now in summer

67
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,630
terms they don't cancel out

68
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:24,799
so am at the code unbalanced and those
the ones a useful friend mr.

69
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:29,580
so the presence of a magnet and be
spinning atoms act like tiny magnets in

70
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
their line-up to face for the magnetic
field

71
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,990
so what's the spinning in all these
which actually be very very strong

72
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,580
magnetic field in in in place

73
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:40,720
then they're lying to to work with the
field so here is my fantastic PowerPoint

74
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,770
animations you've got some he was an
atom spinning in different directions

75
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,950
and then you introduce a very strong
magnet and this causes the atoms all

76
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,510
line up

77
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:52,459
and there with the field then what you
do is you introduced a radio

78
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,490
so you you you and flooded with a

79
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:58,640
electromagnetic energy with radio energy
and when you hit

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,720
I'm the right amount of energy and I'll
get to that in a second

81
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:05,440
am the atoms are able to i'm flip their
spin back to

82
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,820
their original state rather than the
magnetized state if you then take the

83
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,670
radio away

84
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:13,470
they flip back and they met the energy
they just absorb to get them back

85
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,570
so what you do is you detect the energy
you detect that may be a way that's

86
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,108
coming off

87
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,979
and you work out where it was in your
sample and how much

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:25,280
energy came off and that tells you where
it is but the important thing it tells

89
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:25,989
you is

90
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,700
am the method energy required because
it's the mental energy required to flip

91
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,490
the spin state

92
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:34,700
is is different depending on what's
nearby so you got me cool electronic

93
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,380
shielding

94
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:38,430
which is the effect the electron cloud
house on the

95
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:41,750
the nucleus now different atoms will
have different shooting and so they're

96
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,680
kind if an energy to be able to flip
them

97
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,850
but most importantly is atoms mu be
affected by nearby atoms

98
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:51,860
so a hydrogen atom connected to a carbon
atom will require a different amount of

99
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,660
energy to a high gym at some connected
to an auction item

100
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,230
so by knowing how much energy it takes
to flip the state you can work out what

101
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:02,380
was actually never have to make the time
when it when it flipped so what you get

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:06,050
how to animate races this you get a
signal wave and this is it was called in

103
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,169
by the time the main

104
00:05:07,169 --> 00:05:07,419
and

105
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,090
I I'd I don't understand that but I'm
not a mathematician what you want to do

106
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,489
is put into what's called a
frequency-domain sister to seeing with

107
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,960
the the signal over time you wanna see
that the frequency and power

108
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,250
pick the came out a bit and how do you
do this mathematics

109
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,640
their I am as far as I can tell is
mostly

110
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,729
magical but if you ask mathematician
it's actually very a transforms which

111
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,060
again

112
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,610
I can explain but someone here will be
able to and

113
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:34,540
we get at the end as you get this trace
which shows you the frequency and the

114
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,270
amount if

115
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:38,740
energy at member came out at that
frequency and at this point you can stop

116
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,300
their analytics so you can

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,000
you might be able to say that okay I
know that this peak corresponds to

118
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,610
water and then you can start you know
knowing him picking apart the different

119
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,170
things in an imam so how is this useful

120
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:53,220
how does a guest pictures like that from
MRI machines

121
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:58,090
well that's an MRI machines effectively
if any lower resolution NMR machine

122
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,530
and it measures the and the water across
the body city thing

123
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:04,109
and different issues will have the from
water content you got bone which

124
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:05,310
probably fairly low

125
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,610
blood fairly high and by measuring the
water

126
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:11,860
throughout the cell live you get a
fairly good image what's going on in the

127
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:12,260
body

128
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,400
but because it's all just magnetism
radio waves this there's no risk is not

129
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:19,630
ionizing is my X-rays so use animal is
certain to get picture what's going on

130
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:22,860
live in the south some called functional
MRI which is

131
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,350
and fascinating which what it does is it
measures the difference between

132
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,370
oxyhemoglobin and just hemoglobin so it
can tell when

133
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:33,740
a cell is using oxygen tweeters you show
someone a picture

134
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,910
and then you look at their brain and
whether brain is using oxygen about how

135
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:39,610
the brain is cardiac tips you can start
to work out which parts the brain

136
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,590
correlates to

137
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:44,169
what stimuli and that mike is a whole
buncha quite interesting experiment you

138
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,540
can do

139
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:48,460
so seized the samples Sao Tome about
this with the mass spec section but you

140
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,650
can take a sampling very accurately work
out what's inside there you can even

141
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,659
down to kind of at some level um

142
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:58,400
it's very useful for protein structure
so am proteins that you can get a

143
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,830
structure by other ways you can use and
mr. to work out what happens in nearby

144
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,830
and start building up the the structure
the protein what I used for

145
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,900
was and animal where you take a sample
taken

146
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,109
to an animal to sample the cab something
and do it again and see what changed

147
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,010
so I was looking at proteins and trying
to find out where things are binding on

148
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:17,920
Apr 18 C take a sample the protein

149
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:21,740
you get the atoms then you add the thing
you think will change

150
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,660
and some others at a shift because then
you electrons in their electron clouds

151
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,110
and you know that's where the thing
you're looking as binding to proteins

152
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:29,710
that was that I homie

153
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:33,940
by on to my spectroscopy you name you
may name aspect of could be from

154
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,600
airports

155
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,410
so after they do the kind of swap that
your equipment and things but I mean

156
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:37,940
machine

157
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:42,650
that machine is a mass spectrometer and
when it faces charges what's in a sample

158
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:45,239
it breaks down sampling tells you what's
actually in there

159
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,500
how's it work so basically I analyze a
sample seeking a charge

160
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,640
you break it down and and a charge and
then use

161
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,120
a spectrum a power hence mass
spectroscopy to select the ions at

162
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,250
different energies the masses see you
know how heavy is and how charged as

163
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:03,700
and the measure so they're different
types a mass spectroscopy but

164
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:07,969
basically Little Big Town these priests
three stages creating ions

165
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:11,760
at splitting ions and then measuring
them and there are various different

166
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,930
ways to do each stage is

167
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:17,070
other one I came across with Milo is
called electro-spray

168
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,170
so what you do is you get a charge
nozzle and you squirt your sample

169
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,750
through there is a go through the normal

170
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,660
ionizers because the note was charged
but also disperses and the family into

171
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,080
your the texan things that caught my eye

172
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:31,380
crude way of doing it I'm it works but
its that's cheap and

173
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,480
my favorite is her using a laser
obviously and

174
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,539
in this you get your sample you hit it
with a laser beam and that causes the

175
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:38,530
islands to break off

176
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:43,250
and they need represent your machine and
then you then you have to as separate

177
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:43,950
them so

178
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:48,230
am ions have mass in charge so and we're
trying to do is

179
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,920
apply different electric fields and the
ions will behave differently depending

180
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,329
on how have you had a chance they are

181
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:57,760
so you can a you can select for the mat
way by put them in a field some of them

182
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,100
will

183
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:00,800
go one way some go another way and
depending on where you put your detector

184
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,300
you can catch different islands

185
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,439
as another one could quarter polls we
have four electrodes

186
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:10,680
and you create kinda overlapping a.m.
electric fields and then by varying the

187
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:11,660
voted on the field

188
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:15,810
you can select a different can I was
going through is safe if that you feel

189
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,329
is too strong for IO no discretion to go
to the polls

190
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:22,010
but at some point will be exactly my
snow possible way for an infected so by

191
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:22,700
sweeping through

192
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:26,380
you can see all the different islands am
however the current state-of-the-art

193
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,520
release that was when I

194
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,550
stop sign saying was the ferry a
transform internal cyclotron resonance

195
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,640
which is basically a a particle
accelerator see you

196
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,530
you you picture sample stick into the
pockets other chat with us through and

197
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:41,540
then you can select part was coming out
mass incredibly accurate let you really

198
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,579
determine very small

199
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:45,600
differences I'm so can you do with it

200
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,190
am day like mr. you can guess samples it
doesn't have the same resolution as NMR

201
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,980
I'm you can find out what's in a sample
this can be useful for things like save

202
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,780
a new protein we don't know what it does

203
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:58,339
you can break it down and see what the
individual pieces where something that

204
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,380
is used for medicine

205
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:03,240
is and you can use it diagnostically say
for instance a taking urine sample from

206
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,030
a normal patients

207
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,670
and then you take a urine sample from
someone with a prostate cancer even

208
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:10,060
though you might not know what the
individual peaks are if you can see a

209
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,280
difference in profile that maybe you can
start using

210
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,949
diagnostically see you can check for
prostate cancer from after the urine

211
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:15,460
sample

212
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:19,550
Anya and I think probably the most
common usage in terms what you guys will

213
00:10:19,550 --> 00:10:20,030
see is

214
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,380
testing for sample surfaces testing for
the presence of explosives

215
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:27,850
cancer drugs except a masback is kind of
the go to technology factors is pretty

216
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,130
cheap

217
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,860
right gene activity I'm

218
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:36,010
so this you may have heard of in terms
if statements in my press releases like

219
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,180
jean X was more

220
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:40,810
interactive under these conditions so I
wanted to quickly dive into how on earth

221
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:41,979
do you work that out

222
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,320
a quick dive into transcription science

223
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,270
so am I don't know how I have any how
much you guys come across this but and

224
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,040
you got DNA

225
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,160
and then DNA is read in a process called
transcriptions approaching

226
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,620
read and then they create some code mRNA
which is effectively a a copy if the

227
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,080
thing was trying to copy of the DNA

228
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:03,400
the mRNA is then read by another protein
and thats attendance for proteins they

229
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,590
DNA is red at me mRNA and mRNA is red
and that makes protein

230
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:11,470
quick aside this is my favorite pieces
about which is called on to the

231
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,100
polypeptides it's in the States

232
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:18,000
and its a a a completely structurally
accurate depiction of protein being made

233
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,480
so you have the mRNA depicted as the the
line and then there is

234
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:25,370
at the ribosomes making the the growing
protein a touch I quite like

235
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,650
is that the structure of the protein is
accurate after the

236
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:32,529
the thing that code on it so they really
want a great effort to make Acura

237
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,110
so in your DNA you've got a few things

238
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,100
I'm I think important things to focus on
here is you've got what could the coding

239
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:38,550
region

240
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:41,579
and that's the bit but the protein
actually comes from so at some point

241
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,370
that beat is red

242
00:11:42,370 --> 00:11:46,250
and they make for King but then upstream
at that you got this kind of remote area

243
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,470
which is where other proteins can attach
can affect how much of the

244
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:54,300
mRNA is made so if I ate some pretty to
attaching cause more mRNA to be made and

245
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,380
some attaching cause less and that we
get this holiday a gene activity with

246
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:57,939
them being

247
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,149
active in different times and in
different ways so how do you measure

248
00:12:02,149 --> 00:12:06,570
well the old way the old way as you take
your DNA

249
00:12:06,570 --> 00:12:09,680
and you replace Eugene with the thing
that you can measure so in my case I

250
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,569
used AG

251
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,640
a a protein that you catalysed a
chemical reaction

252
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,930
so by running the chemical reaction you
know how much your protein within that

253
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:20,130
you can also use fluorescence and things
like that however this market there are

254
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,480
some arguments against this technique

255
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,760
such as obviously you're interfering
with the DNA downstream so that might

256
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:28,930
that might affect and the results and
it's also considered a bit

257
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:33,620
old-world but when I was but I was
wrapping up the New World was this way

258
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,240
so I say DNA is tended RNAs you get this

259
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:40,820
the single-stranded version it's what
you do is you make a little a little bit

260
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:44,170
that codes for the thing you're
interested in the are you interested in

261
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:48,160
they will naturally I'm they would
actually associate

262
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,469
and when they do you can detect the
fluorescence see attacked a chemical

263
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:52,610
market that when they

264
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:56,670
when they have the bound if dresses and
see you can start to measure the amount

265
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,810
that mRNA in the south and that's how
you can measure the gene activity

266
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:04,219
now in terms of usefulness for this is
most useful for and for

267
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:07,500
scientific research and are currently am

268
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,390
as far as I'm aware commercial or
application because it's quite a lengthy

269
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,500
process I saw them you know you wouldn't
go to

270
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,010
hospital and they just quit your job and
tell you how active Eugene obey some

271
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,610
they could take a sample then maybe tell
you later down the line but it's

272
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,250
something I think

273
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:23,310
we might seem ok being more common but

274
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,930
a quickie Griffin matters a so these
ones are pretty interesting

275
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:29,979
so they measure local gravity I'm now

276
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:33,899
gravity is obviously been a gravity but
it's based on massive the more mass more

277
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:34,540
gravity and

278
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,490
on the earth that's the major mass so
that's very much the guy which is coming

279
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:37,790
from

280
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:41,339
but all of us have gravity so it much
more workers we much smaller but

281
00:13:41,339 --> 00:13:44,529
very subtle differences in gravity
depending on how big something is how

282
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:45,550
dense acceptor

283
00:13:45,550 --> 00:13:49,800
to measure it very very precisely can be
interesting and his he do it

284
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:53,660
am the old ways with course Behringer
veneta so it is you have a mass which

285
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,250
you know

286
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,380
and then you have a spring which is what
causes the rattling spring so increases

287
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:59,260
proportionally to them at UMass

288
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:02,980
so to the the force on it and then you
measure how much the spring stretching

289
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:07,390
so the wait is going to be the mass
times the gravity so any change in the

290
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:10,050
spring is likely due to a a gravity
variation

291
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:14,500
now the pub with this is its relative so
if you have two machines you can compare

292
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,000
them because it can be very subtle
differences in the springs

293
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,149
if you have one machine you can't aim of
waiting for that one machine and move

294
00:14:20,149 --> 00:14:21,110
that machine around

295
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,380
and and get valuable information I'm

296
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:27,449
the current state of the art for
relative is what's called a

297
00:14:27,449 --> 00:14:29,010
superconducting government to

298
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:33,390
and we do here is you get any opium call
and you suspend an electromagnet

299
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,649
so the course trying to fall under
gravity but you're keeping up with that

300
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:38,220
with an electromagnetic field

301
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,440
now the amount serve energy you need to
supply to keep the field going

302
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,140
is going to be a function how much
gravity there is the most trying to fool

303
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,560
the more energy haven't but im

304
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,040
so you can measure gravity incredibly
precisely this way

305
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:54,410
am again promises relatives you can
compare to machines because it's subtle

306
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,100
differences

307
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:58,370
in the setup but you can get relative

308
00:14:58,370 --> 00:15:02,209
I relative values to give you an idea
how sensitive these are I was reading a

309
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:03,189
thesis by one of the

310
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,310
a guy and finish lab he was working on
this and they found they were able to

311
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:07,989
text the gravity difference

312
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,060
from 11 to work then cleared the snow of
the building that they were in

313
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:14,319
so just the way to snow they're able to
detect the difference in mass from at

314
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,310
not being there anymore

315
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,689
which is staggering you think

316
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:20,610
I'm they're awesome absolute profanities

317
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,939
so among the most common ethnic group
the matter is you get a vacuum tube in

318
00:15:23,939 --> 00:15:25,699
america and you drop the mirror

319
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,219
while timing it with the ladies actually
have a an atomic clock and a very

320
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,300
accurate laser measure

321
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,290
and you the time how long it took a
minute to fill in the vacuum and that

322
00:15:33,290 --> 00:15:34,849
gives you a very very precise

323
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:38,100
act measurement for gravity that is
compatible so

324
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,649
when she corrected for noise you can
compare different machines different

325
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:41,149
places

326
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:45,529
these a is a pretty accurate current
state of the art for

327
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:49,170
absolute is what's called an atomic
government to which is where you have

328
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:52,319
a cluster atoms held in a laser trap

329
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:55,378
in in in a vacuum you than 10% off to
let them fall

330
00:15:55,379 --> 00:15:58,499
you can hit them with a laser to cause
them to break a party now got the firm

331
00:15:58,499 --> 00:15:59,350
ass is happening

332
00:15:59,350 --> 00:16:03,209
the fall under gravity in at the bottom
hit with another lazy to recombine them

333
00:16:03,209 --> 00:16:06,679
and then look at the differences and say
you know what happened you know the

334
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,240
gravity was the same but the masses what
changes you can work out

335
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,540
what gravity was in time and these again
are super accurate

336
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,230
I'm story I read was about when Stanford
at uni installed wannabes

337
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:19,999
they were trying to calibrate calibrated
in they found they were able to detect

338
00:16:19,999 --> 00:16:21,740
the massive the moon passing over

339
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:25,470
I'm which can I find staggering the
other thing is they found

340
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:29,199
there was a slight offset every Saturday
and they can work out why until they

341
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:32,258
realize they were detecting the mask at
the crowd at the local store sports

342
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:34,119
stadium which was just one building over

343
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:39,279
hit me incredible stuff talking use it
for

344
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:43,069
and a lot of assign stuff so again you
can detect differences in density

345
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,009
like if you've got nothing to granite
vanity that can be very different if

346
00:16:46,009 --> 00:16:47,829
you've got granite and limestone beneath
you

347
00:16:47,829 --> 00:16:50,609
so you can text you can get kinda
interesting readings about the earth and

348
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:54,509
he's very extensively for that a major
commercial applications that if you

349
00:16:54,509 --> 00:16:55,279
detect oil

350
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,679
I'm cuz I was it will have a different
density to at to rock

351
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,949
the most interesting application are
I've come across there is

352
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:06,908
is actually submarine navigation so and
the Americans for fellow now been using

353
00:17:06,909 --> 00:17:10,949
grievances to detect where they where
the sub is underwater laptop

354
00:17:10,949 --> 00:17:15,490
do the rock because am you don't have an
iPhone or kill him

355
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:18,430
attack that agreement for the passive
measurement I'm

356
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:22,400
an interesting side chairs the film The
Hunt for Red October the Americans I'm

357
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,360
them fill me in a sec and on scene in
which you over here one of the crew

358
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,530
member shoutout reading an email
accounts

359
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:32,080
milligauss is a measurement for gravity
and at that point the soviets realized

360
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:35,139
you know anybody navigating with
trimming the tree because at that point

361
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,530
I was passing by just talking

362
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:40,240
conditions I gave everything to do with
the word

363
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:46,120
murder might 91 plans to go away Jayden

364
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,629
comment what my Casa de and we're gonna
go through a network might be

365
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:54,120
so you may have seen miss him I'm new
law schools where they had incredibly

366
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:54,479
deep

367
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,980
a picture maritime naming to hear there
is a this is BNA

368
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:01,030
a man if he had two hundred nanoscale 32
and

369
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:04,180
credibly here a Mike documents

370
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,780
how do you get all Flickr yet waiting
picturing

371
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,350
tiny the hood and how it works is
actually quite some time things I want

372
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:12,560
to quickly go into

373
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,629
normal microscopy bath you're my of
these you get

374
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:20,440
light you shine it through a specimen to
specimen interferes with my continuing

375
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:21,660
with mine

376
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:25,860
like on a very small scale like idk why
I had a so I had to lay in a little

377
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,610
extra but I don't have an electron
microscope

378
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:31,810
when you get streamable a strong order
then as the Titanic select number of

379
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,600
smaller than light is comparing you can
get better resolution you can see

380
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:35,800
smaller things cuz this

381
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,120
yet more the steps that can happen so
how you doin welcome what can you do

382
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,639
this patent electron microscopy

383
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:45,470
introducing the science stick so

384
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:49,030
atomic force microscope is affected me
and very very sharp stick

385
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:53,910
the on the order a atoms so at the end
it's incredible shots the point about

386
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,890
what you do is you very literally drag

387
00:18:55,890 --> 00:18:59,150
over your sample and then use a laser to
have to cancel Eva

388
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:03,410
Council A's of the of the tip and see
how much it went up when he hit stuff

389
00:19:03,410 --> 00:19:07,600
hood that's good but honestly how they
work I'm

390
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,629
so we can use it for you get incredibly
high resolution image around to hear it

391
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,760
to picture that happen I hadn't gone
here

392
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,800
I'm a carbon rings we can actually see
the top tracks I'm make much

393
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,070
the fact that this crew technology
companies have read about that good

394
00:19:21,070 --> 00:19:26,189
blows my mind however and a little bit
of my favorite ideas

395
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,860
and one of the more interesting
application this number generator so to

396
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,750
die very quickly into strength

397
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:35,980
about traditional hard drives are I'm
spinning platters you haven't bought

398
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:40,290
and that basically magnetic storage so
they first orders as one

399
00:19:40,290 --> 00:19:44,000
dealers on the magnetic drive I'm on
that means is a a one is

400
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,340
is magnetic and his era is so if you get
a tonic force microscope and you

401
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,399
magnifies the tip

402
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,210
you can actually start to measure the
man is not something problem byline

403
00:19:53,210 --> 00:19:56,450
you can actually produce a picture the
hard drive like this now in this the

404
00:19:56,450 --> 00:19:57,110
peaks

405
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,179
and I don't know all the ones and the
the the trough

406
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:03,720
the zeros see can start to measure very
very actually the magnetism in specific

407
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,280
areas

408
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,730
between jerusalem interesting

409
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:10,049
occurs and computers houses etc they
have a life I'll

410
00:20:10,049 --> 00:20:13,530
it it but it wasn't what it does it
takes the index aware that file is

411
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:16,418
stored in a raise in the index if you
just read into the hard disk you can

412
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:19,020
often find the file was there because
it's not been overwritten

413
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,410
if you want to securely erase some
things that can be done

414
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:25,590
what you do is after by that date over
with more data so that you can just do

415
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:26,860
it is now is now gone

416
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,870
however metaphor microscope to so

417
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:32,780
accurate that you can determine the
difference between a one that was

418
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:35,960
overwritten with a zero and zero that
was overwritten with their extreme if

419
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,140
you've ever written the data

420
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,510
you can get such accurate measurements
that you can actually start to recover

421
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,669
the file was written that previously
before

422
00:20:42,669 --> 00:20:45,679
before the it was it was a Briton now
this is

423
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:48,910
quite obviously a very costly and
time-consuming process at it's very

424
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:51,980
rarely done but I think it's really
interesting application for science

425
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,120
so conclusions am

426
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,510
however tiny things are people seem to
be able to measure them cuz they try

427
00:20:58,510 --> 00:20:59,160
hard enough

428
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,990
and sometimes these help bring things
actually end up quite useful in the

429
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:02,750
everyday world

430
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:06,610
I'm I really has been quite well went
also hope that with interesting I'm

431
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:10,159
I'm around people much about any of the
small I'm thanks for listening
