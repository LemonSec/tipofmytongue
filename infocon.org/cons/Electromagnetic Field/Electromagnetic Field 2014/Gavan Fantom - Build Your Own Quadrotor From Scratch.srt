1
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:18,330
we live in the future today

2
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,630
you can go to Maplin in Milton Keynes
and you can't buy

3
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,070
a quarter then you can bring it back
here

4
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,270
and you can fly to left field over there
a gas saver

5
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:36,120
I suspect by the end of the day they
might be sold out but this is the

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,110
reality we live in

7
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,629
quarter it is have become a thing

8
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:45,150
I see a few dotted around here I've seen
several flying around the TMF

9
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,030
and if you want to go out and buy when
you can as I already set

10
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,960
but what are the other options

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,360
so you can go online and you can buy
bits and pieces

12
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,000
you can buy kits you can put them
together and

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,660
you can be flying either within an hour
within a day

14
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,440
within a week within a month within a
year

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:10,860
whichever route you choose

16
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,570
site a few years ago

17
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:19,000
it wasn't quite like you could carry out
and buy all the bits you can really go

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,600
into maps and by a contractor

19
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,929
but you could collapse and by bits and
pieces

20
00:01:23,930 --> 00:01:27,909
you can get an aunt Weiner and you could
download in any fashion about you pilots

21
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:31,000
and tinker with it until it works and
then

22
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,190
fights but that's not what I did

23
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:39,979
I decided that I wanted the supreme
challenge of trying to do it

24
00:01:39,979 --> 00:01:44,070
or maybe not love it as much of it as I
could myself

25
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:48,850
and that is what this talk is about
hopefully by the end of the talk

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:53,169
you all want to go away and build your
own contractor from scratch rather than

27
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,340
buying one from Maplin

28
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,470
so maybe there will be some left after
all but even if you're not that way

29
00:01:58,470 --> 00:01:59,179
inclined

30
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:03,030
I do want to give a better education
about how contractor works

31
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:07,390
so that even if you don't build it
yourself you will have some appreciation

32
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:11,160
what they actually do how they work site

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,609
that's a quote right %uh

34
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,989
when I made earlier which bits have it
could you make yourself

35
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,360
well family obviously if you can see the
picture

36
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,660
actually go to check and everybody see
the picture I K and that we've had some

37
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,930
issues with this in this tent

38
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:35,830
I should have to ask the technical
people here

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:38,840
they can do that but I suspect the
answer is not

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:43,610
yet ticket

41
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,989
so watch the stream pressure the talk
later on and you have to feel slight

42
00:02:47,989 --> 00:02:51,910
I get so obviously

43
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,340
I don't mind frame now

44
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,730
well so people ask how to choose the
size

45
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:01,730
that's what I made it out of this

46
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:04,828
I bought it from being key its a

47
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,760
an aluminium book section from the
county down in the victims to smoke from

48
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:10,220
that

49
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:14,400
and it comes in one meter lengths so
that is helping

50
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,010
Michael treacherous

51
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,269
apparently these work better if you keep
the hope

52
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:27,890
right I'm

53
00:03:27,890 --> 00:03:30,950
I took some aluminium sheet

54
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,540
and and bolted it together

55
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:39,709
so thats about all I'm going to say
about building the frame

56
00:03:39,709 --> 00:03:42,739
because that bit while it was
interesting for me to learn a little bit

57
00:03:42,739 --> 00:03:44,080
a basic metalworking

58
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:48,500
that is basically all there was to it a
commons why in bed

59
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:54,070
other think you could bet you could make
yourself this the electronics

60
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:57,109
the flight controller and all the other
bits and pieces

61
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:01,489
this the motors now to actually
recommend trying to build your own

62
00:04:01,489 --> 00:04:02,190
motors

63
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,500
because modern matches are really really
powerful and really really liked by us

64
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,400
so good and I think even if you really
get me to winding

65
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,610
you will really struggle to achieve the
performance or make you can buy

66
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:18,040
similarly propellers

67
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,140
that very light weights very cheap very
strong

68
00:04:21,140 --> 00:04:25,580
and the consumable so

69
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,979
a few people have tried 3d printing for
palace but they're not

70
00:04:29,979 --> 00:04:33,150
back to rate compared to the ones you
can buy so

71
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:36,370
personally I wouldn't waste the effort
in the house

72
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:40,280
the motor controllers on the other hand
I didn't make my own

73
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:44,140
but there is a significant challenge
their and I know that is something that

74
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,450
some people have tried to do

75
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:49,020
and the other bit

76
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,030
is the radio I have plans to do
something

77
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,960
partially mine for the idea but I I
decided that the estimate was enough

78
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:57,440
work

79
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,789
so the radio is one that I port
off-the-shelf

80
00:05:00,789 --> 00:05:04,430
okay but the stock was a lot of stuff in
there so

81
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:10,720
welcoming to with that

82
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:15,249
yes

83
00:05:15,249 --> 00:05:19,719
why a court right to is kinda question

84
00:05:19,719 --> 00:05:24,120
that some people ask so why did I make a
quarter too well

85
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,139
let's talk about a few different types
of aircraft

86
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,840
so if not familiar with an airplane
probably most people in here

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,150
been in 10 some point in time and yes
you can get ready

88
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:37,599
problems as well fairly simple physics

89
00:05:37,599 --> 00:05:40,830
have a propeller providing thrust

90
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:44,859
you have wings the convert

91
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:49,029
some of this thrust into left keeps it
off the ground

92
00:05:49,029 --> 00:05:52,710
and the one remaining problem

93
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,948
his control this is something that the
early pioneers have

94
00:05:56,949 --> 00:06:02,050
aviation didn't all get right someone to
manage to get the aircraft off the

95
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:02,560
ground

96
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,419
and then realized they didn't know how
to control it site

97
00:06:07,419 --> 00:06:11,020
you need control and on airplanes
control is done

98
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:16,409
by having some moving surfaces ailerons
elevators

99
00:06:16,409 --> 00:06:19,529
flaps writers so on fact

100
00:06:19,529 --> 00:06:23,400
deflect the wind and change the amount
left I'm

101
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,909
on each wing on the front versus the
back

102
00:06:26,909 --> 00:06:31,009
the plane and so on so the other

103
00:06:31,009 --> 00:06:34,870
types of aircraft to reach a craft which
the obvious one is helicopter

104
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,409
now the helicopter doesn't have the same
control surfaces

105
00:06:40,409 --> 00:06:45,270
has one big writer to provide left and a
few other things

106
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:49,139
it also has a tail rotor because if you
have one big writer

107
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:53,169
of that provides left well there's also
some talk

108
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:58,039
coming from that and if it's going one
way

109
00:06:58,039 --> 00:07:01,870
helicopters can be spinning around the
other way so you have a tail rotor

110
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,279
or some equivalents arrangement at the
back of the helicopter

111
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:08,990
which counters that effect and allows
you to fly straight

112
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:13,710
so what about equivalent to the control
surfaces on an airplane

113
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,448
how to control helicopter well this is
where it gets a little bit complicated

114
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:23,389
trying keep it simple for you has the
right to play it means around

115
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,699
thing

116
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,110
makes ready to play right certain parts
of it

117
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:33,419
the angle of attack so that is the the
angle

118
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,979
which the rate two hits the air changes

119
00:07:36,979 --> 00:07:41,219
so you can have a high angle of attack
on this site

120
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:45,289
and a low angle of attack on the other
side

121
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:48,909
so you get a difference in how much left
you get

122
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:52,120
on each side front and back any way
around this

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,159
now this is all done mechanically and

124
00:07:56,159 --> 00:08:00,188
as a person who is not a good fit little
mechanical bits

125
00:08:00,189 --> 00:08:05,349
wasn't so attractive to me site

126
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:11,650
I didn't want to build helicopter now
I'm not great with small little

127
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,299
mechanical bits but I am good

128
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:18,960
with electronics and somewhere which
brings me to a contractor

129
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,409
so quite right to now scott Moore
propellers smoke or more rate is so

130
00:08:24,409 --> 00:08:27,688
it's more complicated right no

131
00:08:27,689 --> 00:08:31,370
the advantage quite right is that

132
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:35,260
you can get away with Ace a really
simple

133
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:41,110
fixed pitch propeller as you're right no
moving parts except for a spinning round

134
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,949
might so that's great for me because I
don't you know I don't think I'm gonna

135
00:08:44,949 --> 00:08:45,439
like

136
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:50,540
thanking all those times mechanical bits
but I can control the speed 24 matches

137
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,800
because I can do that the
microcontroller and that's all you get

138
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,709
to control with her

139
00:08:56,709 --> 00:09:00,910
with the contract so how do you actually
get back to you

140
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:04,110
to do things to do things you want

141
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:07,300
you've got for rate is here

142
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:11,550
now with the helicopter you have this
problem if

143
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,990
having to balance it with the tail right
up because

144
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:19,930
otherwise the and had a couple stops
spinning same deal with the country's

145
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,219
which is why to if the writers have to
go one way

146
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,700
and the other two have to go the other
way around the balance

147
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:33,340
now

148
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,750
is where I use a pro if we've got

149
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:41,070
a quarter to hear and we have to

150
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:45,120
propellers spinning faster let's say the
two nearest to me

151
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:49,460
and to propeller spending slower let's
say the two nearest to you

152
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:56,460
this is what's gonna happen this
location was actually gonna happen is

153
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,339
this

154
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:05,110
affect similarly if these two writers
start going faster

155
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:11,990
and these two stocks lower you get to
make it go up

156
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:15,170
you just have to have a total amount
left that's more than its weight

157
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:19,189
and to make it go down you just reduce
the left

158
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,480
so is the simple theory so we can all go
home

159
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:29,700
yeah yet as a writer on the app

160
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:36,700
unfortunate you don't get away with that
quite say simply

161
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:40,990
you get some imbalances you get some
instability

162
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:45,899
now I don't know how clear this picture
is

163
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:49,670
I don't think really clear enough for
the people

164
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:53,250
from senior project right and I have
come across on the TV well this is

165
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:53,820
Sharon

166
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,320
is a test but I did before interest in
the fight controller

167
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,890
just to show what happens now this thing

168
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:06,060
perhaps this one anymore I was flying
this at the MW last year

169
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:11,020
and it went to be wrong and ended up in
the water say

170
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:14,529
so this is

171
00:11:14,529 --> 00:11:18,490
this is its replacement but this is
based on the same

172
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:24,060
basic specs aiming to same probs well
this was

173
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:27,910
a foreperson the fire control I want to
test the majors in the props to make

174
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,560
sure that way

175
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,630
work properly so I sprinted down to the
heaviest object I could find

176
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:39,630
in this case a spark station one-plus in
the corner here

177
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,949
is one at the feet of the spark station
one-plus

178
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,040
now in this picture I've got 3

179
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,130
if the rate is going up full blast and
one of them

180
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:54,470
in the far corner is of say

181
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:59,380
its unbalanced and I was not expecting
this

182
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:04,209
but it started lifting the spark station
one-plus

183
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:07,650
of the floor not entirely of

184
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:11,310
floor one bit if it was still on the
floor in the opposite corner but that

185
00:12:11,310 --> 00:12:12,430
was enough to scare me

186
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,880
I didn't dare repeat the experiment with
when I wanted to repeat the experiment

187
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,720
with only two

188
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,720
running but I didn't dare hold a camera
at the same time

189
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:34,920
so if we can try to control system
because you couldn't just by this up to

190
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,540
right here even with the mixing

191
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:40,930
to get the two to work together you
would not be able to fly back

192
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:45,109
even a pretty good pilot would not be
able to fly past because unlike an

193
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,450
airplane it doesn't really have inherent
stability

194
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,529
that thing is trying to fall to the
ground and you are trying to stop it

195
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,810
falling to the ground is basically have
it flies so

196
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:58,410
how are you going to control it when
you're gonna control it with

197
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:01,430
am with a

198
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:07,790
ready control transmitter or something
similar now what about it even to

199
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:08,339
control

200
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,360
there a a number of common

201
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,270
flight modes backs I'm various different
flight controllers implement

202
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:19,529
the easiest to implement is what's
called macro

203
00:13:19,529 --> 00:13:24,060
acrobatic made that's what people are
flying when you see them do all sorts of

204
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,119
silly maneuvers I'm out there

205
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:30,540
flips and all the rest now there are
actually some age that make flicks

206
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,069
easier

207
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:34,770
which are calmer the stupid these three
but the basic ones are here

208
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:39,060
so acrobatic made lets you control

209
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:44,310
the rates every Texan so if you've got
your stick in the middle

210
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,079
it's not rotating it can be there they
can be there

211
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:54,780
can be there but it's not right if
you've got your stick

212
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,500
slightly to one side is going to be
maintaining a constant

213
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:04,170
right which is quite hard to do like
this

214
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:09,380
but a concentrated rotation I in reality
is going like that

215
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:14,410
to that's hard to demonstrate and saying
goes this way around

216
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:19,149
all this way around

217
00:14:19,149 --> 00:14:22,539
psychopathic thats that's quite easy
because all you need to do is measure

218
00:14:22,539 --> 00:14:23,749
the rate of rotation

219
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:26,899
and oh come on how to do that shortly

220
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:29,919
the next

221
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:32,989
made school stabilize my which is

222
00:14:32,989 --> 00:14:37,329
a little bit more useful acrobatic made
it quite hard to fly in to fly

223
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:42,039
is possible but it takes a lot of effort
to learn it and

224
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:45,909
will crash while you're trying to learn
to stabilize might

225
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:49,329
controls not the right to protection but
the

226
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:54,118
attitude the ACA the attitude is which
way it's facing

227
00:14:54,119 --> 00:14:59,019
which orientations so this is

228
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:02,959
as near as I can get it level attitude
and that's what you get and stabilize

229
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,449
made if you like it state

230
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,519
that's not going to stop it from

231
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:12,079
drifting along this way with the wind
back again

232
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:16,069
or any of the different variations so
it's going to move around you're going

233
00:15:16,069 --> 00:15:17,478
to have to correct its position

234
00:15:17,479 --> 00:15:24,479
but at least it will correct the
attitude for in practice you still get

235
00:15:24,489 --> 00:15:28,519
in this axis and the your you still get
the same

236
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:33,479
catron right to protection and the other
made if you've got

237
00:15:33,479 --> 00:15:37,059
a really fancy one with GPS and
everything else and

238
00:15:37,059 --> 00:15:41,009
the college boys who made is where
controls the position for you so you've

239
00:15:41,009 --> 00:15:41,759
got to do is

240
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:46,619
point stick forward to me we're just go
forwards when stick back with you

241
00:15:46,619 --> 00:15:50,109
backers as much as it needs to

242
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:53,099
to compensate for the wind and
everything else and just go two way to

243
00:15:53,099 --> 00:15:53,369
go

244
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:58,649
so that's the easiest way to fly but it
depends on GPS very something so

245
00:15:58,649 --> 00:16:03,379
even if you've got made you always want
to learn how to play stabilized

246
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,729
stabilize made is what I implemented on
this

247
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:10,529
I may one day do acrobatics made feeling
brave enough but I don't really fancy

248
00:16:10,529 --> 00:16:13,529
weekend in the workshop rebuilding the
freemen's

249
00:16:13,529 --> 00:16:16,539
instructing everything back onto it to
orphans

250
00:16:16,539 --> 00:16:19,529
so every day

251
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:26,310
site to stabilize made if you're going
to control the attitude you need to know

252
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,128
the attitude

253
00:16:27,129 --> 00:16:31,240
so how do we do that well

254
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,399
this is probably about the right time to
look at the

255
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:38,709
an overview of the electronics that you
get

256
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:42,779
on quadrant so you have some sense is on
the left hand side

257
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:46,050
have a gyro dice que and this is what's
called

258
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,060
rights gyro I'm as distinct from a

259
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:53,790
traditional spinning metal I months
while that doesn't mean it

260
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:58,099
and you have an accelerometer a gyro and
accelerometer

261
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:02,680
the bare minimum you need to find
stabilized in

262
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:06,039
acrobatic made the bare minimum is the
Giro

263
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,099
which is why I said easy to implement
and I've left a box at the bottom

264
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,438
to represent all the other senses that
you might have to select a date

265
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,799
when you have a control system

266
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:21,189
and will go into the details what a
control system does light

267
00:17:21,189 --> 00:17:24,449
because this is I think one of the more
interesting bits of

268
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:28,110
convert and you have the radio

269
00:17:28,109 --> 00:17:31,399
that's receiving all your commands from
the pilot

270
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:37,360
which turns out to be quite important

271
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,250
from the control system you send digital
signals to

272
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,790
PSC's electronic speed controllers for

273
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:48,649
me to drive us this converts I'm a
digital signal from a mic

274
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,710
charla to pulses with lotsa volts and
amps

275
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:56,330
they're going to make just make
turnaround and then you have the motors

276
00:17:56,330 --> 00:18:00,270
for them so that's

277
00:18:00,270 --> 00:18:03,990
reasonably straightforward as an
architect right thing except you've just

278
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:04,650
got lotsa

279
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:11,320
the not yes even matches what can you do
with that

280
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:16,470
we look if we simply for Scotch the yes
season makes us together

281
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:21,380
and the census together you end up with
this control system

282
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,960
controlling you have sensors

283
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,550
passage iraq settlement and anything
else you put into it and of split

284
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:30,970
control system into to

285
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,620
the control system things the actuators

286
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:38,419
the motors in the middle we have
estimation

287
00:18:38,420 --> 00:18:41,920
and we have control this is very
important distinction

288
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:46,580
because the control system well control

289
00:18:46,580 --> 00:18:49,770
some variable in this case

290
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:53,690
attitude to you to be what you want

291
00:18:53,690 --> 00:18:57,050
from the radio but if you don't know
your attitude

292
00:18:57,050 --> 00:19:00,820
that's not gonna get you anything so
talk a little bit about the estimation

293
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,740
process fast

294
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,470
first thing you need for estimation

295
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:12,290
is to figure out a way of representing
your attitude

296
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:15,659
now this is the max bet if the talk

297
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,040
there's not much of it once this is over

298
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,260
we'll get back onto two big boxes I'm

299
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,140
and you don't need to fully understand
all this together Jess so

300
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:33,930
we start off with a call to a friend
some way of saying

301
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:38,560
which way which was north which way is
east which weighs down

302
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,210
this is the the standard for dinner
frame used for aviation use for aircraft

303
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:46,740
but you don't have to use them so

304
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,880
in this diagram the

305
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:53,840
the North being this way into the screen
East

306
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,860
towards me and down

307
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:59,879
being down so the

308
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,160
the diagram on the left is some base
orientation

309
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,730
the you can choose but typically a line
that with the ground

310
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,810
that's quite a good way to start on the
rights we have a difference

311
00:20:12,810 --> 00:20:18,960
orientation different attitude in this
case I've chosen to rate is 30 degrees

312
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:23,529
just to make the numbers line

313
00:20:23,529 --> 00:20:27,090
and we can represent the transformation
between those in a number of different

314
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:27,668
ways

315
00:20:27,669 --> 00:20:33,299
a few of those ways sup and a few of
those ways work well

316
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:38,019
and the ones that suck suffer from a
problem known as kimball look where you

317
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,070
can get into certain orientations where

318
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:44,519
restricted in which way you can go next
so don't do that because if you end up

319
00:20:44,519 --> 00:20:47,250
trying to do some Arab attics or
something like that and you end up in

320
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,260
one of those orientation you will then
crash

321
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:53,289
I'm the two I'm

322
00:20:53,289 --> 00:20:57,500
most popular ones are this which is a
rotation matrix

323
00:20:57,500 --> 00:21:01,809
also known as a direction cosine matrix
and the other one is quite anions

324
00:21:01,809 --> 00:21:05,220
which I'm not gonna talk about now but
they are also equally good

325
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:09,940
and have different advantages so

326
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:13,899
basis a 3d rotation matrix

327
00:21:13,899 --> 00:21:18,340
this represents the rotation from the
corner from the left

328
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:22,189
I the ground to the code in the frame on
the right

329
00:21:22,190 --> 00:21:29,190
ani you aircraft

330
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:30,800
show this another way

331
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:35,639
so

332
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:39,390
that's the one on the left and that's
the one on the right

333
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:44,320
effort 30 degrees in that direction know
what happens

334
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:51,320
lined that way right

335
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:54,330
so this rotation matrix has a few
interesting properties which turned out

336
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,360
to be quite useful

337
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,379
if you look at these rose here

338
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:04,000
the top right I'm

339
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,120
shows the coordinates

340
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:11,719
now these lines are unit vectors

341
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:15,050
now link one in whatever system you
define

342
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:19,070
so the the rows of the matrix

343
00:22:19,070 --> 00:22:23,230
show you the coordinates into these
vectors

344
00:22:23,230 --> 00:22:29,260
in that coordinate system so it's a good
way

345
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:32,379
reading of which way you actually points

346
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:38,340
in the other coding system and same
vertically

347
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:42,449
they show you the confidence of the left
ankle

348
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:47,500
prime in terms on the right-hand corner
friend another

349
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,580
that misaligned in the transition to
Windows so this

350
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,580
turned out to be quite useful because

351
00:22:55,580 --> 00:23:00,169
you've got a nice vector tells you which
way is

352
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:07,170
down which went thinks it down in this
case that showing you

353
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:12,200
this factor in terms of the coordinate
system here

354
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,369
now that's great because if you've got

355
00:23:15,369 --> 00:23:18,720
affective it tells you which way gravity
is pointing

356
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:22,869
that's a factor in this coordinate
system

357
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:28,629
this pointing straight down so that's
this column here

358
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:32,279
and if that difference

359
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,720
then you know you can you've got some
corrections

360
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,169
seemed

361
00:23:40,169 --> 00:23:44,299
max right so let's talk about senses

362
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:49,070
a gyro or rates gyro measures the rate
of rotation

363
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:52,580
they will tell you how many degrees per
second you are right 8 saying

364
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:57,299
in each of the three axes if you're
flying acrobatic might that's cool you

365
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:57,710
need

366
00:23:57,710 --> 00:24:00,749
you can cite I'm rotating 10 degrees a
second

367
00:24:00,749 --> 00:24:04,109
I wanted to be going twelve degrees a
second I need to go faster

368
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,239
job done

369
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:13,289
well at least you can pass that into
your control system if you want to get

370
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:14,190
back to choose

371
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:17,330
its bit more complicated so it tells you
a greater rotation

372
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:21,049
and if you read I'm if you read for that
sense

373
00:24:21,049 --> 00:24:25,320
say a hundred times every second then
every time you read from it

374
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,369
you can add you reading

375
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:32,549
onto you make checks by at I mean apply
rotation

376
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:36,720
so rotating your estimate of when you
think you are

377
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:43,470
every time you get a reading from the
Giro that's really accurate over a short

378
00:24:43,470 --> 00:24:44,239
period of time

379
00:24:44,239 --> 00:24:49,259
say every time rotated you know how much
you protected you

380
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:52,489
kept track event now you know

381
00:24:52,489 --> 00:24:56,320
which way up here %ah which weighs down
except

382
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,259
if I it takes if you if you wait over a
long time that's not going to work so

383
00:25:00,259 --> 00:25:00,869
well because

384
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:03,879
every time you get a reading you have a
small

385
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:08,129
every reading and those evers add up

386
00:25:08,129 --> 00:25:11,189
and after a while you think

387
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,129
you think that you know this way up

388
00:25:15,129 --> 00:25:18,449
when actually your back

389
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:21,879
now that's not conducive to say flight

390
00:25:21,879 --> 00:25:25,469
I actually have this I'm last year

391
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:28,629
I had a booking my flight controller
where I'm

392
00:25:28,629 --> 00:25:32,009
the where wasn't doing the corrections

393
00:25:32,009 --> 00:25:36,389
this and I was actually quite impressed
that it could take off in a cover for a

394
00:25:36,389 --> 00:25:36,839
while

395
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:41,099
and over the course of about a minute it
was

396
00:25:41,099 --> 00:25:45,099
slowly drifting to about that which is
the limited

397
00:25:45,099 --> 00:25:49,580
I could compensate for with the
controller so much less for limited to

398
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,399
about a minute

399
00:25:50,399 --> 00:25:57,399
I'm but I surprise it was not long

400
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,130
sonya is no absolute references nothing
to correct it but there's nothing to

401
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:03,929
tell you which way

402
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:08,679
actually down compared to which were you
think is down so that's where

403
00:26:08,679 --> 00:26:12,500
you make sense is coming you
accelerometer

404
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:17,230
their accelerometer measures
acceleration right except

405
00:26:17,230 --> 00:26:22,460
gravity is kind of the same thing so in
effect you actually get a combination of

406
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,789
accelerant acceleration of gravity

407
00:26:24,789 --> 00:26:28,879
I said acceleration plus craft is
actually kinda vaccination minus gravity

408
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:29,600
because few

409
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,240
not leaving that's equivalent
accelerating upwards

410
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,360
1g right we make an assumption here this
is about the only assumption we really

411
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:40,860
make

412
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:43,918
national insisted some ice important

413
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,169
make and we assume that overall you
average

414
00:26:47,169 --> 00:26:54,169
acceleration is 0 over the long term you
money flying rather

415
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,419
thing but you know constantly
accelerating otherwise you'll end up

416
00:26:58,419 --> 00:26:59,030
space

417
00:26:59,030 --> 00:27:02,908
third anytime bus finite it is when
you're in a

418
00:27:02,909 --> 00:27:06,360
continuous long sweeping

419
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:11,120
coordinated turn which quarter two
pilots really don't do very often

420
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:16,809
and if you do that you're quite
reachable Haiti

421
00:27:16,809 --> 00:27:19,899
now the downside accelerant acres you
you can say well why can't we just

422
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,920
you know take back Santa Rosa reading
let me know which was down because

423
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,000
that's what a lot of phones do in other
applications

424
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:29,049
so but it's very noisy very noisy indeed

425
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:33,160
I'm you know it could be all over the
place

426
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,900
I'm that's not gonna and well for your
flight so what you actually need to do

427
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:41,660
is take a combination I'm not going to
go into the details of these because

428
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,820
that is quite messy

429
00:27:42,820 --> 00:27:46,309
but you take one of a number of
algorithms

430
00:27:46,309 --> 00:27:51,309
to combine the gyro and accelerometer a
person names up so that when you look at

431
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:52,389
the slice later

432
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:59,250
you know what to do before so back to
control system

433
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:03,130
with on the estimation we know what the
attitude is

434
00:28:03,130 --> 00:28:06,450
now it's time to control it

435
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:10,110
so the

436
00:28:10,110 --> 00:28:14,709
most common form of control Houston
quarters's today

437
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:19,830
is a PI de controlar is not the only one
point any means and it's not even the

438
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:20,389
best

439
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:26,100
but it is simple

440
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:30,360
it looks like there's a bit to it but
there really isn't fiscal p90

441
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,050
because there are three parts to it
proportional

442
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,730
integral under

443
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:40,150
analysts say is you take

444
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:44,320
your estimate before you are

445
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,550
and you take the signal from the radio
which says you want to be there

446
00:28:48,550 --> 00:28:53,790
you got about 30 degrees of ever you
multiply that by you

447
00:28:53,790 --> 00:28:57,990
Peter by AP coefficient and that says

448
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,530
okay I want to apply Quoizel also forced
to go back the other way over in a

449
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,379
little bit of

450
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:08,690
just a few very small amounts force
that's never gonna get you quite

451
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:11,960
because it's gonna slow down as against
so you have this I term

452
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:16,340
when you add up the ever the longer you
are pointing this way

453
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,649
the more the kick its gonna give to
bring it back and the determine just

454
00:29:21,650 --> 00:29:23,190
takes a very short term

455
00:29:23,190 --> 00:29:27,010
very certain gusty winds and everything
else and just

456
00:29:27,010 --> 00:29:32,730
looks at him so how do you change as
well

457
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,250
you've got to come up with those pind
values I'm not gonna go to the details

458
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,600
back as a million things on YouTube on
how to do it

459
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,719
I do have a

460
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,720
very short video which shows

461
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:01,690
feels

462
00:30:11,149 --> 00:30:13,238
I think you know you

463
00:30:13,239 --> 00:30:20,239
home fine consequently happened

464
00:30:24,029 --> 00:30:27,419
Liberty because if you're a student
council

465
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:30,940
are you going to happen there is none
night

466
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:37,940
my question I'm not going to happen

467
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:43,620
single piece of information all the
sensor data all the radio in per

468
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:47,360
all the major have put the attitude
estimate every single time because on

469
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,090
the controlling

470
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:51,908
that's great because I can look at it
off to its and I figure out what went

471
00:30:51,909 --> 00:30:52,409
wrong

472
00:30:52,409 --> 00:30:56,850
after it crashed some people choose to
do this

473
00:30:56,850 --> 00:31:00,969
but telemetry sending that data down the
radio yes to compress it a bit

474
00:31:00,970 --> 00:31:04,200
with cheese yet to be more picky about
which day to you actually send

475
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:09,890
but that's another way to do it the
other kitty bowing technique is using

476
00:31:09,890 --> 00:31:11,529
your eyes look at it when it flies

477
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:15,270
is it will blink is an oscillating is a
stable is it

478
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:19,158
sluggish and

479
00:31:19,159 --> 00:31:22,630
when it goes wrong watch it as it drops
to the ground in crashes even though

480
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,020
that will break your heart

481
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:28,480
and then once you've got all that data

482
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,039
you can try doing some simulation as
well is where show you my next year

483
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:41,039
well that really doesn't show it too
well

484
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,289
the codresceau love this is something
that is real data from a flight

485
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:48,820
at home 2013 so last year

486
00:31:48,820 --> 00:31:52,639
last summer in the Netherlands and

487
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,590
I had a bug in the attitude adjustment
so

488
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:00,720
on the left here we have a quadrature
that is displaying the attitude

489
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:04,620
from the lock file of which way up forty
what

490
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,600
and on the right hand side there's
another quarter to displaying

491
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:14,418
I'm the estimate has done by a new test
algorithm on my PC

492
00:32:14,419 --> 00:32:19,049
so I didn't even need to fly in to get
back and see after a while they diverge

493
00:32:19,049 --> 00:32:26,049
starting to type it but you really can
see it so we'll move on

494
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,649
so you're getting close to the point
where you can actually fly

495
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,890
you knew caught that you've just been
building there's a few safety concerns

496
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:39,100
which we really have to cover before we
can go off like

497
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,889
the first one is office he choose a safe
place to fly we have

498
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:46,220
flying field here approaching the wins a
bit problematic

499
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,220
and sir mix-a-lot difficult but

500
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:52,740
you really want to be in a place that if
you have to suddenly turn it off or

501
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:53,710
anything goes wrong

502
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:57,270
they can crash to the ground without
killing anybody or maiming them

503
00:32:57,270 --> 00:33:01,330
his back that would be bad the

504
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:04,879
other thing that might happen first time
you turn it on

505
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,390
it might be confused

506
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:11,770
first time I turn this on for real in
somebody's garden

507
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:15,389
was her there was

508
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:19,500
a she was in this one is the last one
was a couple days before EMF last time

509
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:23,179
at there was a book in it it thought

510
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:29,970
that it was rotating like this I turned
it on when I was about here

511
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:34,450
when he thought it was about here so
what's the first thing it did

512
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:40,720
it tried to correct itself or I wanted
that look like in practice

513
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,120
well it was kinda more like backed I was
quick

514
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:49,879
I kill the throttle and I grabbed it
when I was up at this angle but thats

515
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,990
yeah I was quick hey that could have
been

516
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:59,990
quite uncomfortable this thing is
actively trying to kill you

517
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:03,410
if you have it on the ground and it is
powered up

518
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:08,710
it could turn always rotors of lines
your face

519
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:13,310
you do not want that to happen site

520
00:34:13,310 --> 00:34:19,109
way

521
00:34:19,109 --> 00:34:22,790
up gets worse for them

522
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:26,429
perhaps but

523
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:32,149
yeah it's worse for you than that if the
contractor does that so

524
00:34:32,149 --> 00:34:35,339
when you power it up you want to do a
bunch of pre-flight checks

525
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,770
in your software this thing will not
power up

526
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,960
if it thinks is rotating more than a
certain speed

527
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,330
this thing will not power up if it
thinks

528
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:51,049
that is more than a certain number of
degrees from horizontal this thing will

529
00:34:51,050 --> 00:34:51,889
not power up

530
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:55,320
I'm under a number of different
circumstances if it doesn't have a radio

531
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,810
signal this thing will not power up

532
00:34:56,810 --> 00:35:01,799
if the throttle is not set to zero hour
first held at these things mean the when

533
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:02,619
I plug it in

534
00:35:02,619 --> 00:35:05,810
I have some degree of confidence that it
is not going to try to kill me

535
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:10,980
or anybody else K that's a really good
thing to have in their

536
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:15,000
am I would not be wanting to fly this

537
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,950
if it didn't have a safety feature ready
a fail-safe

538
00:35:19,950 --> 00:35:24,180
a lot of radius support some kinda
fail-safe mode if you lose contact

539
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:27,960
regard to rate your range what you
wanted to do

540
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,180
either has GPS and I can find its way
home mine doesn't yet if you don't have

541
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:34,680
to

542
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:38,919
you need to do something safe and on
asleep safest thing is probably just to

543
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,100
switch off all the motors

544
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:44,350
let it fall from the sky because you
chose a safe place to fly

545
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:49,220
that means there weren't any people
underneath it

546
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:52,859
the alternative is to attempt to keep
flying without knowing where you are

547
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,660
and it might go over a bunch of people

548
00:35:56,660 --> 00:36:00,509
all vehicles or property or something
else and if it then crashes into the

549
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,060
ground

550
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,410
propeller still running or possibly
injure a person you really don't want

551
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:05,029
that so

552
00:36:05,030 --> 00:36:09,660
a combination of a safe place to fly and
being able to kilometers at any time

553
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,790
have if you lease ready if

554
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:17,009
radio contact also manually if you've
lost control of it

555
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,600
skill with Russell or press the kill
switch depending on which way you set up

556
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,640
and the other been a safety

557
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,020
contractors and many other model things
use lithium polymer batteries

558
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,240
they are also but

559
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:36,390
if you treat them badly they will treat
you badly if you overcharge them

560
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:40,350
if you over discharge them they don't
like it if you puncture them they don't

561
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:41,259
like it as well

562
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,490
and the consequence you can look up on a
new cheaper ten-year-old

563
00:36:44,490 --> 00:36:50,509
high-pressure gas coming out in Catching
Fire sass great

564
00:36:50,510 --> 00:36:54,540
rights every operating

565
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:57,960
in the UK we just have a little bit more
stuff to consider

566
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,480
there is lower about this K all

567
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,030
aviation in the UK is Sam regulated by
the end of a cation order

568
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:09,540
I'm not gonna go too much into details
the law because it is quite a complex

569
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:10,290
subject

570
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,910
but I'm gonna try and simplify for you
as much like and just

571
00:37:13,910 --> 00:37:18,069
you know haven't my safe area to keep it
safe I'm not a lawyer this is not legal

572
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:18,630
advice

573
00:37:18,630 --> 00:37:22,280
look it up et cetera et cetera I'm

574
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:25,010
the Civil Aviation Authority is
published a couple documents that are

575
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:25,640
relevant

576
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:29,250
cap 393 which is their interpretation of
the invocation order

577
00:37:29,250 --> 00:37:33,930
and the one specifically relevant to us
this cap 72 have put these on his so the

578
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,220
you

579
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:38,819
know what to give you for later am cap
72 refers to

580
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:44,510
unmanned aerial systems which these are
and of course

581
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:49,620
in other countries the law may vary so
the easy way to stay legal

582
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:52,630
is key within these guidelines

583
00:37:52,630 --> 00:37:56,120
keep your aircraft less than seven
kilograms

584
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:01,220
because then you don't have to comply
with lots of extra regulations

585
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:04,200
by seven kilograms is quite a lot this
weighs just under two and a half

586
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,000
kilograms I consider this quite happy

587
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,380
I think the only one that i've seen of
late

588
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,430
that was anything more than that was the
ready controlled ostrich

589
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:17,730
maintain official line of sight

590
00:38:17,730 --> 00:38:20,760
to avoid collisions is specifically to
avoid collisions

591
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,010
if you're going to fly into something or
somebody's gonna fly into you

592
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:27,670
you need to know this so you can take
evasive action that applies

593
00:38:27,670 --> 00:38:31,140
even if you're flying with goggles you
need to have somebody else's competent

594
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:31,759
standing

595
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,099
somewhere where they can see that you're
about to hit something

596
00:38:35,099 --> 00:38:41,589
and tell you so that you can take
evasive action stay below 400 feet above

597
00:38:41,589 --> 00:38:42,380
ground level

598
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:46,319
now four hundred feet quite a scary way
way if you're flying

599
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:51,380
line of sight and but if you got GPS and
stuff is worth being aware that is a

600
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:51,869
limit

601
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:55,940
and not for a real work if you're making
money out of it

602
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:59,230
then different regulations apply and you
need to

603
00:38:59,230 --> 00:39:02,780
show your competence and give the CAA
some money for a permit

604
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:06,400
probably so this is the easy way

605
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:10,980
if you just wanna fly around fun as soon
as you put a camera on it

606
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:14,060
it becomes a surveillance craft

607
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:18,119
if that camera is used for anything
other than just flying it

608
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:21,910
so if you've got a camera with goggles
that might not be a surveillance craft

609
00:39:21,910 --> 00:39:23,089
but if you record it

610
00:39:23,089 --> 00:39:26,180
eighties then you have extra
restrictions which

611
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:30,299
kinda relevant here because you have to
stay 150 meters away from congested

612
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,829
areas you cannot fly over them

613
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:36,510
and also includes any open-air
somebody's of over 1000 people which

614
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:40,819
EMF is and you have to stay 50 meters
away from

615
00:39:40,819 --> 00:39:44,300
vessels vehicles and structures not
under your control

616
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:47,520
so you can fly around your own house as
long as you live in the middle of

617
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,060
nowhere

618
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:52,369
but if somebody else's house you have to
have where effectively their permission

619
00:39:52,369 --> 00:39:54,510
and

620
00:39:54,510 --> 00:39:59,020
50 meters away from persons not under
your control if you can shout duck and

621
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,560
they do

622
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:06,560
does not count as under control I'm not
sure

623
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:07,570
price in nineteen

624
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:11,750
got to the point where you can stop
actually flying so how do you do it

625
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:18,660
this is quite a common

626
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:24,190
transmitter as two sticks on it loss
over the buttons and knobs for most to

627
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,180
them irrelevant

628
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:28,180
these two sticks

629
00:40:28,180 --> 00:40:31,810
this is the most common configuration
but there are others

630
00:40:31,810 --> 00:40:38,810
so check you might help fuck you fly so
the the left stick controls the throttle

631
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,500
you stick it up

632
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:44,750
full power you really want to hold that
down into you are not standing over a

633
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:50,600
and and if you miss the left stick side
ways that controls you your

634
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,319
access as a reminder

635
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,340
this is your play

636
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:04,260
your pitch is controlled

637
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:08,510
by moving the right stick forwards and
backwards and your role is controlled by

638
00:41:08,510 --> 00:41:10,280
making the rice stick left and right

639
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:15,119
this will be quite important when you
actually take off

640
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,670
such a basic control salted

641
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:23,050
may get to learn to fly it

642
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:26,170
the best advice I can give you is to
keep

643
00:41:26,170 --> 00:41:29,900
the front ovett pointing away from you
that way when you miss the state left it

644
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:30,670
goes left

645
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:33,800
when you leave the state right it goes
right if you do it the other way around

646
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:35,040
he will get confused

647
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,509
and your very first step is going to be
taking off as quite easy

648
00:41:40,510 --> 00:41:43,760
you bring the throttle up to where is
about to take off you give it a bit

649
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:44,670
extra it

650
00:41:44,670 --> 00:41:48,619
lift itself off then you have about
three seconds to figure out how to fly

651
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:52,450
it before you crash

652
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:54,850
so young the majority of us going to
learn how to hover

653
00:41:54,850 --> 00:41:58,240
and landing is just a case of covering
Sam

654
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:01,939
just above the ground trying not to me
for and current down a little bit

655
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:05,480
and Hannes the video

656
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:08,500
all

657
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:12,540
my first quadrotor at BMF 2012

658
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,180
about two days after its maiden flight
while I was still trying

659
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:24,180
learning how to fly this

660
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:39,380
site you can see that very well he
thinks

661
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:44,300
he wants to see this final stage

662
00:42:44,300 --> 00:42:51,300
right I K

663
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,500
you notice I'm leaning over this I trust
my faith my am

664
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:05,500
my pre-flight checks on this

665
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:18,680
the space can be nice and clean after
this

666
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:32,560
I shoulda practices before the court

667
00:43:56,130 --> 00:43:57,260
up the summit in a minute

668
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:00,850
soldiers from the finish of with their

669
00:44:00,850 --> 00:44:03,640
with things you could do after that
because this was still flying stabilize

670
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,109
mode

671
00:44:04,110 --> 00:44:07,890
so the next steps a fairly office you
have more sensors

672
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,009
because when you have more sense as you
can see more things you can add a

673
00:44:11,010 --> 00:44:13,610
magnetometer to give you an absolute
reference for you

674
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:16,840
for your so if you want to fly north you
can fly north

675
00:44:16,840 --> 00:44:21,850
as opposed to just some direction you
cannot altimeter

676
00:44:21,850 --> 00:44:27,560
so that you can control how high you are
by you at this point I mean the computer

677
00:44:27,560 --> 00:44:27,910
right

678
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,549
and similarly rangefinder pointing at
the ground

679
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:36,250
gives you more accurate control when
you're quite like and

680
00:44:36,250 --> 00:44:40,290
the other one that's very attractive as
GPS so that you can tell it gonna fly to

681
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,730
those columns over there

682
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:44,810
and hope to the I got them in the right
country

683
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:51,810
in so I'm just going to play you out

684
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:59,550
with nothing that you can do to it

685
00:44:59,550 --> 00:45:06,550
is to attach a camera thank you very
much

686
00:45:13,270 --> 00:45:20,270
now do

687
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:24,400
do

688
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:31,400
a

689
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:57,920
do

690
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:09,800
okay

691
00:46:12,150 --> 00:46:16,740
do

692
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:23,740
do

693
00:46:28,950 --> 00:46:32,680
do

694
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:39,680
do

695
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:48,730
do

696
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,720
do

697
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:20,840
okay

698
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:48,790
do

699
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,640
do

700
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,700
do

701
00:48:01,700 --> 00:48:02,980
yeah

702
00:48:02,980 --> 00:48:04,320
okay
