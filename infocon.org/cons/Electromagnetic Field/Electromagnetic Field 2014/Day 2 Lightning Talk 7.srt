1
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,350
and I profess some slides

2
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:15,480
but unbelievably I couldn't get them off
my tablet like no outright allowed me to

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:15,840
get up

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,130
file of which is unfortunate and

5
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:25,330
well that's a up still got it seventy
wants to see my at my scribble drawings

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:26,360
on my tablet then

7
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,750
that damn I hope you know so I can find
on the web I am

8
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:32,989
so I just graduated I'm also fun
employed

9
00:00:32,989 --> 00:00:36,910
completing the Triple Threat their
unemployed people and

10
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:41,250
so what I did for my at my masters
project in mind sharing degree

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:45,129
was built a human powered submarine
which I'm gonna tell you about for a bit

12
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:46,500
and

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,269
so this is a a it's a team at the it
wasn't just me over there's a there's a

14
00:00:50,269 --> 00:00:51,300
beautiful picture this

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,370
they always are la hiding in the
background their so way saying there is

16
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,959
a the air the chassis here out book
section

17
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,440
misbehave aluminium book section we made
a a rather unconventional submarine to

18
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,010
be honest

19
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:10,009
because the what you might sorta X the I
miss something

20
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,009
are such as true as a and hips

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,770
so

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,460
Riak so moving on

23
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,720
yeah what you'd expect a sovereign to
look like is something like that yes or

24
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,530
sleek slim 20 these guys are the
competition winners this year they were

25
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,920
fucking legendary that Canadian

26
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,650
and nothing was wicked fast as she two
guys in that sucks three long

27
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,470
truly cramps one guy's head is right
next to the shops a sort of like this in

28
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,679
the in the ass and other

29
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,610
nine-a anyway as did not apply to an

30
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:51,590
I was at work uni and thats like
literally right into the country no see

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,290
anywhere nearby I am no marine expertise
none of us knew what we were doing is

32
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,320
the first year that worked on the
project

33
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,380
so we just didn't know what we were
doing sensual it I'm we were competing

34
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:04,729
lotta guys that did why the new pictures

35
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,560
sucks I'll find a facebook and

36
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,850
so anyway we were we were building a
submarine

37
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:15,920
with the with no idea what we were doing
Camino

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,920
search on Facebook i'm looking in shoes

39
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:25,930
area her

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:29,150
your unless I'm the first page

41
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:32,409
okay site yeah we both submarine and

42
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:36,040
its pedal-powered there's a there's a
dude and it goes underwater

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,250
and it's a it's described as a flooded
hull

44
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:42,569
so it's not sealed is not pressured and
this is what we made

45
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:45,640
at your notes that doesn't look anything
like the

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:48,659
that nicely so the cigar shaped thing I
showed you before

47
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:53,298
I am where this key realization I I'd
like station credit for I'm pretty sure

48
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,400
is mad I remember exactly gonna take
credit for

49
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,829
an it's not a pressure vessel said
doesn't need to be round cuz we're not

50
00:02:58,829 --> 00:03:00,760
going to distribute this service
pressure

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,129
evenly so what we did you can see here
we got the soda

52
00:03:04,129 --> 00:03:07,750
trapezoidal cross-section coming down
here across the bottom

53
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:11,370
and I was too will accommodate the
pilots position he sorta

54
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:15,060
an

55
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,859
so those guys hands on some controllers
down here face here looking at all these

56
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,189
nice big pretty when does

57
00:03:20,189 --> 00:03:24,168
and his palms up here on this and petals
around the back an

58
00:03:24,169 --> 00:03:27,239
say it with trapezoidal cross-section
when Ash allowed us to do is

59
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,400
save a lot of time money effort versus
the

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:35,019
these guys who have a accompli layup so
they build a a massive mold

61
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,129
and fill it with glass fiber and what
not huge hassle

62
00:03:38,129 --> 00:03:42,328
all we did was well some other mini book
section together in such a pounce on

63
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:45,419
super easy really cheap really

64
00:03:45,419 --> 00:03:48,959
modular extensible you know if you do
anything to it we literally just

65
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,010
taking a drill to bring in your hole in
came tightest hold on

66
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:56,129
easy peasy so offer stench into this
competition

67
00:03:56,129 --> 00:03:59,399
and question did really well we're
seeing here is the awards room

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,419
at term the kinetic base down the cost
for which is where the

69
00:04:03,419 --> 00:04:07,069
the competition was held an that's
awesome there was room

70
00:04:07,069 --> 00:04:10,530
192 subjectivity in their out all
competitors

71
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,280
on a fast rise we're pretty happy with
our we did really well became fourth

72
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:14,959
overall

73
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:18,829
out well

74
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:22,760
at a a

75
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,750
if only that way for later villa yes we
can both several other 12

76
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:31,530
I'm and the main reason for that is
basically we we were the slowest team

77
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:37,530
out any actually finished the race the
other ones just didn't finish it and

78
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,000
so there were three good subs they went
round the course they did it quickly

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:45,320
and those hours when round the course
will it she took about four times as

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,360
long as anybody else

81
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:50,560
they were doing in 90 seconds or so I we
did in about eight minutes

82
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,710
something mental a as ours was hella
slow

83
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,799
it was it was for the problems there
were multiple design flaws

84
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,810
there should be a nice nice picture on
his somewhere maybe no

85
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,240
I'm so course and you have sort of a
straight line down this giant swimming

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:05,710
pool

87
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:09,710
imagines ordered like an Olympic
swimming pool but twice the links in

88
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:13,270
every direction some remaining one
minute remaining

89
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:19,060
wow and say add so twice the size
Olympic swimming pool in every direction

90
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:23,230
you go down at you go around the end in
any come back to a slalom and

91
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,990
I never did quite well we ended up with
an award for SoCal dramatic performance

92
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:32,950
a nicknamed the Oscar and because I was
a I was just a ridiculous compared to

93
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,030
the competition go Nick

94
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:37,989
we got nicknamed the underwater Land
Rover I am but things we did well

95
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:40,650
because we we stuck some principles he
said just make it work

96
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,739
and the make it work but you gotta get
something working first and having

97
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,890
something I actually worked was really
key in this

98
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:48,979
it was ugly you know it just look
horrible it

99
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:53,120
everyone thought it was an absolute joke
when he turned up no end up coming forth

100
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,960
and we're pretty happy with that we
didn't know what we're doing by in the

101
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:56,330
end

102
00:05:56,330 --> 00:06:00,099
where she did really well and so running
on time

103
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:07,100
any questions God you

104
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,070
and well that wasn't for us to judge
relish

105
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:17,620
the I agree it's a

106
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:21,419
it's a bit a silly thing be literally
the only use I can think for his drug

107
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:22,000
smuggling

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,600
I was unable to sync any other use for a

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,150
and which right now we were down on the
south coast for a couple weeks

110
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:32,090
for this competition over the whole time
I didn't hear anybody suggest a

111
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,070
legitimate use

112
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:38,830
I am say I am II john also diagrammed
obviously there's a

113
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:42,349
like and tank in there for the diver got

114
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:46,949
various or like essentially balloons
which you can fill with air to control a

115
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:51,300
a.m. pass the word I know I'm talking
about

116
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,520
thank you to right questions

117
00:06:54,520 --> 00:07:01,520
yeah well his cousin the way to scoring
was structured

118
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,550
so you have to you have to finish the
race without scoring a penalty is

119
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,720
to for to be counted so even though we

120
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,990
took eight minutes or so to get around
we did it without any penalties and none

121
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,669
of the others were almost them didn't
even get around until they're also so

122
00:07:14,669 --> 00:07:15,430
there is like

123
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:19,590
there was one who had biomimetic sort of
laughing things like that which

124
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:23,750
looks gorgeous but just didn't work like
not even in the slightest

125
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,150
others had to and i won one pilot kept
repeatedly having panic attacks in the

126
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,560
sub

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,710
a nobody realized he was in admitting
every time he got in

128
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:34,729
and then he was just like no it's not
working is not working there's actually

129
00:07:34,729 --> 00:07:37,620
just is having a panic attack in the
didn't realize this until two days

130
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,410
before the end for any pilot in

131
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,530
you parted no other doings and practiced
say didn't work

132
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,559
also there's like a and

133
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,729
ours is huge says plenty of space our
pilot was the

134
00:07:48,729 --> 00:07:51,810
well attorneys really bad at driving
games

135
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:55,520
and which we we only found out about
halfway through the competition so

136
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,690
perhaps that was why couldn't really
stay very well but he was at least

137
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:00,919
experienced divers and no panic attacks

138
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:06,650
an say that was why I was one most them
cocked it up so massively

139
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,638
Justin and many many failure modes and
everything all

140
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:14,550
anything else

141
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:18,010
lovely okay what I was going to further
questions all wants to see my little as

142
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:19,260
scribbling at the submarine

143
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:26,260
come talk to me my name's rich but I

144
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,920
thanks to everyone for coming to light
in talks
