1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,550
I

2
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:13,170
a

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,769
come to this next talk which is being
given by a cat

4
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:21,770
Harris who will be presenting on a brief
history of visual effects big round of

5
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:24,770
applause things

6
00:00:28,850 --> 00:00:35,300
ok how everyone on cameras and I work in
the visual effects industry and I'm a

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:41,120
bit sad about all this stuff so who we
should probably start right at the

8
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:42,019
beginning

9
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:48,890
this is the execution of Mary Queen of
Scots it was made in 1895 it's a

10
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,239
substitution effect

11
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,800
basically you stop the camera while
you're filming you replace something in

12
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,370
the scene and then you start the camera
again it's a very basic sort of magic

13
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,940
trick and it was made by Edison labs in
1895 bear in mind i have half an hour to

14
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:11,899
get from this 1895 to this which was
last year's Oscar winner in half an hour

15
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:17,450
so yes I'm going to be cherry picking a
bit i'm going to be specializing in

16
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:21,170
certain things that i really like this
is obviously star trek this is the same

17
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:21,770
thing

18
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:28,158
so the substitution trick that we looked
at just a minute ago it was sort of

19
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:35,570
perfected by a guy called George malleus
he was trained as a stage magician and

20
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,630
he created these incredible effects

21
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:44,990
he made over 500 films over 200 of which
we still have and he's well worth

22
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,309
looking up

23
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:51,920
he's just made this incredible
collection of strange weird and

24
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,539
wonderful things

25
00:01:53,539 --> 00:02:00,439
this is a journey to the moon and it was
made in 1902 one of his earlier films

26
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:07,130
uses another trick that I quite like to
talk about and that's this one which is

27
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:12,380
just known as for trouble some heads and
he uses this amazing trick called

28
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:14,210
matting

29
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:18,680
we're basically when you're filming you
filming through a plate of glass and you

30
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:25,510
put a little square little black square
where you want that head to go then

31
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:35,560
you film everything you want then you
put the film back into your camera film

32
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,180
through a plate which is black except
for the square and then he stuck his

33
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,540
head through the table and got an
assistant to wave and arm when he waves

34
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,109
an arm

35
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,489
it's it requires incredible timing
incredible skill but it works really

36
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:54,849
well and matting was used not only just
as this sort of fun magic trick but it

37
00:02:54,849 --> 00:02:58,149
was used for real films as well this is
the great train robbery

38
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:03,069
it was made in 1903 it's one of the
first film's to ever really have a story

39
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:09,399
and the train outside the window is not
actually there they couldn't possibly

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:12,700
film that in those days because film
stock falls and capable of dealing with

41
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,250
the difference in light between inside
and outside

42
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:21,129
so again they just painted out when
they've filmed inside they painted out

43
00:03:21,129 --> 00:03:24,459
the window and then they've taken the
same film stock and filmed outside

44
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:27,459
through glass where they painted out the
shape of the room

45
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,668
now this is one trick there's another
trick which is rear projection

46
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:41,169
this is king kong made in 1933 and in a
minute you're going to see the woman

47
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:47,410
appearing in this cave and that is just
they filmed her early on and projected

48
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:54,010
it against a screen inside this tiny
tiny set this is a minute is that this

49
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,828
is a full-size set and have done exactly
the same thing but they projected

50
00:03:56,829 --> 00:04:01,299
against a screen on the windows and
you've got the giant stop motion

51
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:09,609
King Kong the next big problem you've
got is this is great for a static things

52
00:04:09,609 --> 00:04:12,519
where you can paint a piece of glass

53
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:15,549
but as soon as you have something moving
this is going to fail horribly

54
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:22,240
so the trick we use is called a
traveling Matt the earliest kinds this

55
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:30,520
is from sun rays sunrise made in 1927
1927 and you film against black and then

56
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:34,810
you run your film through a process
which exposes it on to more film we put

57
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,380
loads of life

58
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:40,330
through so it brightens up and then
brightens up and then brightens up and

59
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,580
then you have a shape which is the shape
of the characters you want to keep you

60
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:54,219
use that and you expose your original
back plate against this so that you get

61
00:04:54,220 --> 00:05:01,480
an outline and then you put your
original film back in and that produces

62
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:08,530
characters that can move now it's not
perfect but it's pretty good for 1927

63
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:19,000
um now this was used in a lot of films
and one of my absolute favorite is the

64
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:26,260
invisible man where Lord reigns here is
wearing a black velvet suit against a

65
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:31,599
black background and dancing like an
idiot and having a great time and this

66
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,660
is one that is definitely worth watching
they actually use this technique

67
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,750
even better techniques were available
because this was so popular now this

68
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,650
sort of these sorts of techniques of
matting we use for a very long time you

69
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,690
can't use them with colour though

70
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:53,710
so at the beginning of color film they
still had to use only placed mats

71
00:05:54,310 --> 00:06:01,540
this is one of my favorite it's the app
sorry

72
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:09,490
the 10 commandments which was made in
1923 and they filmed this giant tank 10

73
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:15,850
meter high tank of water all cascading
in and then showed it flowing backwards

74
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,330
for the background of the Red Sea
parting

75
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:28,000
it's brilliant and it it's one of the
iconic film movement moment again though

76
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:34,300
we're still stuck with backgrounds which
nobody can interact with you see you got

77
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,300
a lot of this and you still get a lot of
this

78
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:42,610
to make one of the most sort of simple
ways to make a really beautiful

79
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:48,190
background is to paint it and this this
is the wizard of oz and I can talk for a

80
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:52,870
long time about the weather rolls but
this was in Technicolor

81
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:55,870
which is why the shoes of red because
red showed up really well

82
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:01,960
instead of silver like in the book this
is a matte painting this is a picture

83
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:07,060
that has been drawn on glass and is
filmed in front of the camera while the

84
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,479
set is below that shape

85
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:16,539
this is a laser image of a guy called
Peter Ellen sure who painted some of the

86
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:21,099
most beautiful pictures but this is
basically what it is you just get the

87
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:25,570
sheet of glass and you paint beautiful
stuff on it and it was

88
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,840
it's used for absolutely years and years
and years

89
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,460
there are wonderful wonderful films most
of the films that you watch with

90
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:41,948
beautiful sort of dramatic backdrops
will have this in and it's still used we

91
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,490
can work

92
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:48,639
yes this is guardians of the galaxy so
any background here just come out of the

93
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:53,169
department called digital map painting
which does exactly the same thing and

94
00:07:53,169 --> 00:07:54,099
it's digital

95
00:07:54,099 --> 00:08:01,060
all of the background clouds here are
just a still image some of which is sort

96
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,979
of large and you can rotate around its
just a still image anything close is

97
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:10,570
actually a 3d object which I made me

98
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:11,520
yeah

99
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:20,190
um yeah so we're moving on a little bit
more

100
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,080
and what if you want to get characters
that move species stop motion

101
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:29,400
this is Ray Harryhausen if you haven't
seen a film that Ray Harryhausen had had

102
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:32,279
his grubby little mitts on then please
do

103
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,630
he makes some of them made some of the
most beautiful stop motion images

104
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:42,958
no this is jason and the argonauts and
it was made in 1963

105
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:48,599
and it still stands up because it looks
beautiful doesn't real but it's

106
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,200
beautiful

107
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,579
it's been four and a half months moving
tiny bits of stuff all by himself

108
00:08:53,579 --> 00:08:56,609
because he was such a perfectionist he
wouldn't let anyone else work on it

109
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:04,079
so we've got all of we've got all of
these sort of amazing things that we can

110
00:09:04,079 --> 00:09:08,459
put together but we still haven't really
got a decent technology for putting

111
00:09:08,459 --> 00:09:14,969
people moving in a scene with other
stuff and there were a lot of early

112
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:22,860
process is but the best one was this one
and this is yelling screen

113
00:09:24,149 --> 00:09:31,860
what happened was sodium light is a very
very specific frequency and so amazing i

114
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,470
called Petrov the house built a prism
which could split out the specific

115
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:43,350
frequency of sodium lights and all of
this was acted in front of a screen lit

116
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:47,640
by the sodium light and then it was run
through the prism all of the normal like

117
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:52,260
went to the camera and then all of the
specific frequency sodium like went

118
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:57,930
through to another camera and produce a
really really good outline i mean this

119
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,699
is really flawless

120
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:05,670
there was a downside to this though
because they only made one

121
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,740
prism and it's only weighed worked with
one size of film

122
00:10:11,889 --> 00:10:15,489
and disney owned it and and they weren't
terribly nice about lending it out to

123
00:10:15,489 --> 00:10:18,609
people so there were a bunch of other
technologies

124
00:10:18,609 --> 00:10:22,629
there was this one which was a really
early blue screen but if you're close

125
00:10:22,629 --> 00:10:23,709
enough to see it

126
00:10:23,709 --> 00:10:28,059
he's got a great big blue outline around
him it doesn't really work that well

127
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:35,379
finally it got to bend her which was
going to be epic is going to be enormous

128
00:10:35,379 --> 00:10:39,069
they want to have a really really
amazing technology and it was on a

129
00:10:39,069 --> 00:10:43,358
bigger film stock than disney like so
they were stuck

130
00:10:44,319 --> 00:10:49,149
so they went back to petrol over the
house and he invented this incredibly

131
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:55,029
wonderfully complex system taking a blue
screen and taking the blue and the green

132
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:59,739
components and mixing them all up in
this magical machine called an optical

133
00:10:59,739 --> 00:11:06,129
printer and it would take me about 10
minutes to explain how this works but

134
00:11:06,129 --> 00:11:08,199
it's wonderful and complicated

135
00:11:08,199 --> 00:11:12,459
the reason they use a blue screen is
because people are mainly sort of

136
00:11:12,459 --> 00:11:20,410
somewhere between pinky yellow and sort
of brown yellow and so yellow is made up

137
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:23,049
of green and red

138
00:11:23,049 --> 00:11:27,129
unless you're very very pale skin or
very very dark-skinned you don't tend to

139
00:11:27,129 --> 00:11:31,209
have a lot of blue in skin tones so blue
is the best background and if you're

140
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,679
using original film stocks the blue
tends to have the smallest grain so

141
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:39,879
that's why that that's what blue got
used until very very recently and i'll

142
00:11:39,879 --> 00:11:42,879
go into what we use green now later

143
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:51,339
so we've got we can put things on for in
front of each other not amazing but how

144
00:11:51,339 --> 00:11:57,309
about making some exciting sets and I we
now get to the 2001 and I could have

145
00:11:57,309 --> 00:12:01,600
done like a half an hour on 2001 this

146
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,759
this is a set this is a rotating giant
set of giants

147
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,870
it was amazing

148
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,240
they built this and this technique is
still used today it was used on

149
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:20,240
inception which is sort of ridiculous
for the scene they used exactly the same

150
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,230
kind of thing

151
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:26,330
christopher nolan is a bit of a crazy
person he did actually suspend a plane

152
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:33,080
from another plane in Batman like de
loves practical effects and budgets

153
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:42,080
whoo-hoo but yea 2001 has amazing effect
this this is my second favorite cheap

154
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:46,490
affect my absolute favorite is
terminated to where you've got a mirror

155
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:52,790
scene with sarah connor doing work on
the terminators brain and that's done by

156
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:57,770
using Sarah Connors twin like the
actress just has a twin and they used

157
00:12:57,770 --> 00:12:59,870
hope the other side of the mirror is
wonderful

158
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:06,529
this shot is done by having a pen on a
bit of acetate just being moved in front

159
00:13:06,529 --> 00:13:09,529
of the camera

160
00:13:10,570 --> 00:13:13,570
and yet it looks so amazing

161
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:20,140
this of course is the iconic ending and
this was done using an amazing technique

162
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,340
will slit scan

163
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:31,540
basically it involves getting a large
piece of a sort of pattern putting a

164
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:37,089
slate in front of it and then filming on
a long exposure and panning backwards

165
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,410
from that slit

166
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:45,490
so basically you scan across very slowly
a little bit of that shape that the sort

167
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:51,970
of fun pattern you then move the pattern
on slightly and do it again and its

168
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:55,990
really really complicated it's amazing
and I do suggest you look up how it's

169
00:13:55,990 --> 00:13:56,290
done

170
00:13:56,290 --> 00:13:59,980
the slits guns photography is dead now
because you can

171
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,670
that sort of thing requires vast amounts
of equipment it's expensive it's huge

172
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,660
and you can do this in about 10 minutes
in our after effects now there's not

173
00:14:07,660 --> 00:14:09,219
much point building it

174
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:15,370
things that i think is still built worth
building though our giant models we

175
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:23,680
don't so much which is very sad but this
is obviously star wars and it's just

176
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:25,089
beautiful

177
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:28,120
most of these were built from bits of FX
kits

178
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:32,410
if you look very carefully on a lot of
sort of stuff from this era

179
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:37,750
you'll notice lots of pipework and that
pipe work is actually the sprues from

180
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:42,850
the FX kids that they're just stick on
wherever they're like it is absolutely

181
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:43,180
beautiful

182
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:46,479
all of the little laser flashes
certainly in the original not in the

183
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,720
remastered are we're just done using a
process called rotoscoping they're just

184
00:14:52,720 --> 00:15:00,160
drawn on the original Ghostbusters
proton packs just drawn on a very very

185
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,680
time consuming process but it looks
really good now star was you might not

186
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,410
realize the very early pioneer of CGI
this

187
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,280
there was a little bit in the andromeda
strain which is a nineteen seventy one's

188
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:20,449
a little bit earlier but this sequence
of sort of how you enter the death star

189
00:15:20,450 --> 00:15:26,540
when I one is is some of the very
earliest bits of film effects and it

190
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,819
took forever

191
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:34,820
it's it is sort of wonderful stuff and
I'll get onto your computer stuff in a

192
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:41,330
minute but I want to go a little bit
back to some of the joys of sort of the

193
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:45,440
nineteen eighties that late seventies in
nineteen eighties which was prosthetics

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:51,830
this is an american werewolf in london
each probe each shot of this is a

195
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:54,170
separate prospect appliance

196
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:58,819
they took about half a day to apply in
about four hours to remove afterwards

197
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,430
and it's incredible

198
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:06,199
he's sticking his head through a hole in
the floor in this and this is hair

199
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:09,740
pulled through rubber and then filmed
backwards

200
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:15,140
it is incredible and that the the
techniques in this a wonderful and the

201
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:20,870
next one is the thing which is also
completely brilliant

202
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:26,930
it's gone it's madness if you haven't
seen this film watch this film

203
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,910
it's it's basically a masterpiece of
effects

204
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:35,329
the guy that worked on this essentially
work seven days a week

205
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:40,340
sort of 14 hour days and eventually had
to book himself into a hospital for

206
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:46,040
exhaustion after he finished it because
it's just a film of bunkers things like

207
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,540
you can just imagine the director go

208
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:53,959
well I want his face to melt and then
kind of be in half and then a tongue

209
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,470
comes and grabs and the guys just going
ok

210
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:01,530
hi

211
00:17:01,530 --> 00:17:04,530
but yes it's beautiful

212
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:09,030
so there is a limit to what you can do
with this

213
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,780
and we do end up getting into CDI and
obviously the first stage I film people

214
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:16,980
think of his trauma and drama is
beautiful

215
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:26,909
it was made in 1982 and along with Star
Trek the wrath of khan was the first to

216
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,590
feature really big

217
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:34,050
cgi sequences they were both denied they
want even nominated for the visual

218
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:39,810
effects Oscar in 1982 because apparently
using computers is too easy

219
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,270
uh-huh

220
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:49,560
for reference in nineteen eighty-four
there was a that there's about 25

221
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,899
minutes of the the last starfighter
which is done in CGI beautiful

222
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:58,440
it took two years to make on a crazy
super computer

223
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:02,520
so yes it's not easy

224
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,120
and then this is cutting-edge this is
the star trek wrath of khan the Genesis

225
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,280
sequence which is all very very only
things I mean this is that this is sort

226
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:18,180
of people making things up from nowhere
there was not technology that was not

227
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,180
software to do this and people just
built it

228
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:30,750
it took a while for us to get actual cgi
characters but not very long in 1985

229
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:35,220
this is the young sherlock holmes and
this is the first stage I character that

230
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:43,020
is not a bit intron and it's not it's
really short but it's really quite

231
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:48,389
impressive but things moved on really
quickly from there

232
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:53,400
this is the base made in 1989 and it's
the first of realistic-looking water

233
00:18:54,810 --> 00:19:01,919
it's again it's a really sort of lovely
very cleverly crafted affect you then

234
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,990
moved on to things like terminated to my
favorite in 1981

235
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:13,290
you'll notice though that everything is
very reflective we can do reflective

236
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:16,770
surfaces we can't really at this point
do anything that looks like skin

237
00:19:16,770 --> 00:19:18,720
convincingly

238
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,650
it took it took another year in 92 to
get realistic looking skin in

239
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:31,350
weirdly enough in death becomes her
which is not known for its cgi but it's

240
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:37,678
in this sequence with the next like the
next stretch again this is worth film

241
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:48,600
worth watching it's ridiculous but I
some beautiful prosthetics again all the

242
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:54,059
way through the film but that stretch
that stretch was CGI skin perfectly

243
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:56,790
composited so you don't really realize
that it's there

244
00:19:56,790 --> 00:20:03,178
so we've we've had a 92 @ but the big
thing really happened in 1995 with toy

245
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:09,240
story now toy story was seminal it was
the first did there had been short there

246
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,570
had been sections of films that were
made in CGI but this was the first

247
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:20,730
character lead story that was all CGI
and we had a lot of changes since that

248
00:20:20,730 --> 00:20:25,170
is worth bearing in mind that if you
watch it now it looks a bit pant because

249
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:29,370
they're worried about four different
kinds of textures they could do the

250
00:20:29,370 --> 00:20:32,850
shadows don't really work we've got a
lot of different technologies for making

251
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:38,340
really good contact shadows and stuff
but yeah it's still holds office this

252
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:46,110
amazing thing and yeah it's in over 20
years old

253
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:50,669
oh it's called rights

254
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:54,000
yeah so then the next big one

255
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,780
probably in terms of CGI was

256
00:20:56,780 --> 00:21:00,500
the matrix Oh something happened

257
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:09,379
I'm going up the cable is it is it yeah

258
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:22,760
no cables ok so the matrix which i will
try and show you in a minute okay

259
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:29,120
the matrix which i'll try and show you
in a second is is awesome but actually

260
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,120
that that's not the right one

261
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:39,200
no it's not working

262
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:43,820
I'm so sorry peeps okay let's try this

263
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:56,780
yes I'm a drag ok this is this is one of
the really big effect a lot of stuff in

264
00:21:56,780 --> 00:22:01,730
the matrix wasn't actually that knew it
was just used in really clever ways

265
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,630
so this was a rake of still cameras
placed in this amazing array and then

266
00:22:05,630 --> 00:22:10,640
triggered very very carefully so that
they all went that that basically if you

267
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,160
took the frame from each camera it look
like

268
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,990
normal footage beautiful but at the same
time

269
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:21,140
this wasn't necessarily that new
actually some of the better

270
00:22:21,140 --> 00:22:25,910
new cgi is actually in the later films
which I don't really want to talk but

271
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:32,030
that rubbish but that the agent smith
fight is actually really technologically

272
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:33,649
exciting

273
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:37,310
so it's worth talking about why why
change from blue to green screen behind

274
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:42,320
me Oh in that in that early shot and
that's because digital cameras work

275
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:47,870
differently from film to digital cameras
have a shape that looks like this and

276
00:22:47,870 --> 00:22:52,280
this means you have twice as many green
pixels as blue pixels so you get much

277
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:53,210
better definition

278
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,590
so you you want to have the best
definition possible in the thing you're

279
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,620
going to try and take out because you
want to be it is it to be as detailed as

280
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:06,379
possible so you can do incredible things
like this and this is obviously the

281
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,120
Martian that stage with the

282
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:14,219
the red and green bits that was
rotoscoping that was probably probably

283
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:19,530
some very poorly percent pay person in
India drawing around stuff

284
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:24,809
this does unfortunately get out sourced
mainly to India still because it cheap

285
00:23:24,809 --> 00:23:34,170
and it doesn't require that much skill
it just requires a lot of time so greens

286
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:35,610
with we've got greens meant

287
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:40,949
we've actually reached the two thousand
now we've got new millennium stuff and

288
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:46,830
so I'm going to go with this is my first
first film of the new millennium and it

289
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,550
might seem weird but actually it's
because this was the advent of digital

290
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:55,950
color grading this is what it originally
looked like beautiful sort of summary

291
00:23:55,950 --> 00:24:02,010
day they scanned the entire film into a
computer and graded it to get this

292
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:06,450
beautiful autumnal look and it's a
really important thing is we're all of

293
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:12,330
our all of the hated teal and orange
nonsense comes from now but if you the

294
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:16,980
color of films is incredibly important
is how you can really recognize up sort

295
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:21,030
of after the two thousand film is
because it's been digitally calibrated

296
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:28,080
another big thing you'll notice in
things after the two thousand is good

297
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:31,530
oceans this is the perfect storm

298
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:38,550
it's a tiny bit the perfect storm can I
find a tiny bit and this is this was a

299
00:24:38,550 --> 00:24:42,600
technology invented by island called
flip and it involves a really

300
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:47,699
complicated system involving volumes and
particles all interacting and sharing

301
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:52,830
attributes and very very complicated and
I use it all the time and I hate it

302
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:58,560
but it produces beautiful water and
before that you couldn't really do it

303
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:07,140
the other big cgi thing is crowds and
crowds and sort of ubiquitous now

304
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,040
everywhere

305
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:14,220
you'll find them in the background of
adverts with football matches like all

306
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:18,180
of the crowds in those stadiums any
football anything formed in football

307
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,090
stadium with crowds in the background in
an advert

308
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:26,070
they're all digital who they're all just
made with the software called massive or

309
00:25:26,070 --> 00:25:30,750
there are some other ones that are
similar and but this involves taking

310
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:35,700
loads and loads of little characters
giving them or attributes and then

311
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:39,390
telling them how to interact with each
other and it produces this incredible

312
00:25:39,390 --> 00:25:44,910
effect where we go ahead

313
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:50,130
oh so this is the other one that is the
big change

314
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:56,850
this is motion capture now we have
motion capture a lot earlier on but this

315
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,689
part of the caribbean dead mans chest
was the first one to use on set in

316
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:03,300
motion capture because you've seen it
with all the people with a little

317
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:07,770
ping-pong balls running around basically
all that involves is you get a lot of

318
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,580
cameras and they film all the ping-pong
balls and a computer very carefully

319
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:16,649
works out which ping pong ball is which
from frame to frame it then works out

320
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:20,670
where they're supposed to be on your
person and creates a skeleton

321
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:25,110
it's incredible and he's even more
incredible when it's done on set where

322
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:29,100
you can't really put all of the cameras
insensible places so this is this is

323
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:33,300
amazing tech and it was taken one step
further with avatar

324
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,720
where the entire thing was motion
captured you

325
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,590
you've got all of these amazing facial
emotion captures we've got a little

326
00:26:43,590 --> 00:26:49,439
witness cams taking pictures of
everyone's faces they scanned everyone's

327
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:54,870
faces so that they they could create the
most realistic looking weird aliens that

328
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:59,669
look like the actors and it was really
the first one to kind of beat the

329
00:26:59,670 --> 00:27:04,860
uncanny valley they actually look like
characters instead of weird things that

330
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:14,428
are sort of human ish and that really
gets us sort of where we are now this is

331
00:27:14,429 --> 00:27:19,350
gravity and it's utterly beautiful and
it's definitely worth a watch if you

332
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:21,240
haven't seen it

333
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:27,480
the big thing with this was that we've
gone the other way for motion capture

334
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:32,220
all of this was done in previous which
means it was done in a very simple way

335
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,400
like you just saw it

336
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,710
so the entire film was essentially done
with more s computer game characters

337
00:27:40,710 --> 00:27:45,690
they then knew exactly how everything
was going to be late and built a rig

338
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:52,890
that put the actors into a lighting rig
which was computer-controlled so they

339
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:58,830
did all of their acting so that you get
all of this amazing realistic lighting

340
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,129
on the actors so that it matches

341
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:10,950
cgi around them which is incredible and
yet so this is this is this is kind of

342
00:28:10,950 --> 00:28:14,940
where we are now there's nothing that
hugely changing we've got amazing

343
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:19,800
characters the character a member of
animation is really changing and really

344
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:24,210
getting more beautiful we've got things
like Groot and Rocket Raccoon baby Groot

345
00:28:24,210 --> 00:28:25,789
is so cute

346
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:34,429
um yes a but all of these things are
sort of just taking what we've already

347
00:28:34,429 --> 00:28:39,799
been up back to all of this sort of very
basic prosthetics humans move and just

348
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:44,029
moving it on and that's that's sort of
more or less where we are today

349
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:48,919
I hope that's okay if anyone has any
questions I'd love to take some I don't

350
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:56,600
know how much longer I got it

351
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,010
yeah
