1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,320
and hi everybody my name is crazy i work
at the British Science Association i'm

2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,880
going to hand over to have ready spring
a very very sick very soon after this

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,529
very short introduction and so I wake of
the British Science Association and

4
00:00:25,529 --> 00:00:30,269
Bradley actually won one of our reward
lectures which he presented at the

5
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,280
British Science Festival last year and
and this is part of his his award letter

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,140
was giving this and talk on flexible
electronics and so if you're interested

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,989
in the British Science Vessel do you
find me afterwards this year is in

8
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:44,910
swansea in September

9
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:48,959
it's going to be great there's a beach
party and there's hundreds of events so

10
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,559
you do come along if you're from that
area or if you fancy a trip

11
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,899
the hour is beautiful so now I shall
introduce ready stay ready as priya is a

12
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,359
researcher at the University of sorry

13
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:03,960
and he research he is flexible
electronics and there are many

14
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:08,010
applications as they now can we
introduce him gets giving us giving a

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,010
welcome has given around

16
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:19,240
thanks very much thank you hello
everyone I am I can't see your faces I'm

17
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:21,339
just assuming that you're here

18
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,510
really i'm going to start straight on
because the time is quite sure for this

19
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,170
one

20
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:29,890
this is a talk about plastic electronics
this is a talk about electronics so I

21
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:36,010
thought we start in the time in place
which was absolutely essential for the

22
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,780
beginning of electronics which is of
course the capital of Romania Bucharest

23
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:49,000
where I come from so we're in 1998 in
about sep tember 11 saturday i was

24
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,770
coming from a film that I saw with my
girlfriend and i stopped at the bus stop

25
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,860
waiting for the bus and i bought my
first copy of this computer magazine and

26
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:07,479
I spent most of the evening reading it
and in there

27
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,930
the most fascinating thing possible was
this the pentium to 433 megahertz

28
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:19,330
processor this was an absolute behemoth
and I thought this is it this is the

29
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:24,130
future they seized the pinnacle of
semiconductor engineering so I was

30
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:28,660
completely enthralled by this but then I
got a bit sad

31
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:34,630
mainly because the film we went to see
was Titanic but it was more than that

32
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,340
you see I wanted to be part of this
thing I wanted to be part of the story

33
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,900
of electronics I wanted to create things
but it's unfortunately I was just a

34
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,989
child I was just going to school so I
wasn't able to do anything

35
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,660
and this was the future and it was
happening now and I'd missed it but was

36
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,470
it

37
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:01,630
let me remind you how the nineteen
nineties looked this is how computer

38
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,430
graphics looked in the nineties

39
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:08,860
this is how mobile communications looked
in the nineties and this is how web

40
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,810
design looked in the nineties

41
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:15,130
so was that the future well it was in
some sense but not quite

42
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:24,670
it was in fact a small cock a small part
of a chain that started with the

43
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:30,339
development of the first integrated
circuit in the fifties by a bunch of

44
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:33,850
guys that look like this one guy in the
picture

45
00:03:33,850 --> 00:03:36,970
probably to your left is Gordon Moore

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:42,579
now go two more become famous for
Moore's law which is really an

47
00:03:42,579 --> 00:03:44,410
observation is a lot of law at all

48
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:49,120
this guy at some point looked at the
amount of stuff that was going into an

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,440
integrated circuit

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:57,070
he said ok there were five or six or
seven components up to about 20 up to

51
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,799
about 30 by the mid sixties

52
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:08,350
so he just drew a dotted line and that
dotted line went on for 50 years to the

53
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,780
point that these days

54
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:16,750
computer chips have parts that are a
hundred of a millionth of a meter across

55
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:23,470
and there are many billions of them in a
single chip the size of a fingernail and

56
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:29,139
where of course concerned with digital
circuits where we only care about the

57
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:35,290
zeros and the ones we only care about
the extremes of of what the data can i

58
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:43,810
can represent analog is getting a bit
left behind I suppose in the public's

59
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:47,080
imagination in the digital world but i'm
going to tell you in a second that

60
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:52,150
analog is or rather plastic electronics
and the future of electronics is all

61
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:57,549
about analog so in analog we're really
concerned with all of the values that a

62
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:04,180
signal can take from its minimum to its
maximum and the plenty of Heroes for

63
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,760
animal for digital but there are a lot
of unknown heroes / analog as well who

64
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,480
is this

65
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,270
do you know who this is

66
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:20,340
what will our fantastic so this guy was
instrumental again in creating fantastic

67
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,359
electronic circuits amplifiers current
sources you name it

68
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,170
analog electronic circuits in the
sixties and seventies and eighties and

69
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:36,240
he was not quite the advocate of digital
as this picture shows right analog is

70
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:41,610
something that that I hold very DM and
in fact eventually to go back to this is

71
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:44,130
the story on my first slides

72
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:49,530
eventually I was able to work on some
fairly clever analog circuits still in

73
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,849
Bucharest and still something that I'm
quite proud of the thing though is that

74
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:59,040
all of these circuits analog and digital
usually are made of my new specs of

75
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,360
silicon

76
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:04,980
so the chips are quite small as you can
see but there are plenty of electronic

77
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:10,410
circuits which are large by definition
and we were talking about what what's

78
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:14,940
technically called large area
electronics but mostly display screens

79
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,280
right they're meant to be large because
that's that's their thing they need to

80
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,349
be large so the circuit has to go on a
fairly large substrate usually glass and

81
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:30,270
this is a genuine this genuine size of
the glass that people make TV screens

82
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:34,500
and and things on now of course glass
has a bit of a problem and i'll show you

83
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:42,810
what the problem is with this simple
video and i'll explain the UH the phone

84
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,380
there is just used for contrast is not
part of the circuit but i'm going to

85
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:51,659
make a very simple electronic circuit
that I'm gonna brother electric circuit

86
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:54,900
that I'm going to tie together through a
piece of metal eyes glass

87
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:59,520
so there's nothing very clever about it
is just a piece of glass with metal on

88
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,370
closes the circuit when that happens an
LED lights up but you'll see in a second

89
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,720
that glass has its problems

90
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,770
so that's just a simple circuit if we
use this glass slide with aluminium on

91
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:16,969
top

92
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:23,840
we just close the circuit and of course
the LED lights up right now the problem

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:32,150
is glass very frequently comes into
contact with fairly rigid stuff and we

94
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:38,120
all know if we had a mobile phone be
dropped on the pavement that happens

95
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:43,190
quite frequently and quite tragically so
you've seen the circuit dies the circuit

96
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:51,410
is broken so class has its problems but
what we do with our screens is we

97
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:57,770
protect them by encasing cell phones
into some sort of plastic cover and this

98
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:02,240
is exactly what i was doing when I was
making this video i was using some sort

99
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,800
of plastic protection for my eyes and we
do this all the time for electronics but

100
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,430
why not make them out of plastic to
start with

101
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:19,280
so here's a bit of plastic that I've
metallized only on one surface and we

102
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,640
still close the circuit the way we did

103
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:28,729
and long story short this can take a lot
of abuse as you might think

104
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:36,479
there you go

105
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,779
right so why don't we make all our
electronics on plastic rather than on

106
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,060
glass a large area electronics

107
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:48,689
well the problem is of course the
plastic doesn't really like high

108
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:53,100
temperatures and a lot of our processing
of the materials that gets into our

109
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:59,279
electronic circuits has to happen at 400
or 600 degrees Celsius a lot of the time

110
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,480
glass barely can stand that plastic
wouldn't stand a chance

111
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:18,120
right so we're

112
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:24,540
we need to change completely the system
of our fabrication we need to use other

113
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,439
materials other machines other processes
to create electronics on plastic

114
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,330
ideally that can we stand low
temperatures we talk about plastic

115
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:38,760
electronics but we can also call them
printed electronics a flexible or

116
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:42,900
solution process in the sense that the
materials that we putting down

117
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:52,050
I now put down at very low temperatures
in the form of things like inks sorry

118
00:09:52,050 --> 00:10:00,630
pastes and gels by printing stamping or
even spraying so this is extremely low

119
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:06,120
cost fabrication at low temperatures for
future electronics and then of course

120
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:11,640
advantages things like costs and area
you can do this on a vast area without

121
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,620
having a large production machine you
can do it a bit like you print

122
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:20,790
newspapers and magazines and of course
you can print a lot of them

123
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:26,130
the point is that soon enough we should
be able to print electronics on flexible

124
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,820
plastic at the same speed as we print up

125
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:36,660
I know hello magazine however there are
downsides the biggest downside really is

126
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,520
the speed and by this i mean the speed
of our circuits so the problem here is

127
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:47,490
that the materials that we use the
semiconductors that we now use in the

128
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:54,390
place of silicon are now a thousand to a
million times less able to pass current

129
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:59,640
so the transistors that we're making in
the circus that we're making are going

130
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:05,400
to be slower by the same amount and
you've is a problem if you're using

131
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:08,459
these very fast production techniques

132
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:13,140
a lot of the time you're patterning is
going to be mediocre to say that the

133
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,800
least

134
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,990
and you you are going to end up with

135
00:11:16,990 --> 00:11:24,580
either completely failed or circuits
with very very different specifications

136
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,990
to what you expected

137
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:29,260
now i work at the University of sorry

138
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:33,220
in the electronic engineering department
and the approach that we've taken to

139
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:37,330
solving these problems of yield and
speed and uniformity for plastic

140
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:43,420
electronics is to completely rethink the
design of the building block of the

141
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:46,660
transistor and we've come up with this
thing called the source skated

142
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:51,610
transistor and it's very very similar to
the conventional transistor that we

143
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,140
using display screens

144
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:58,149
except this time we're using the contact
between the metal and the semiconductor

145
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:02,920
and the barrier the energy barrier that
forms naturally there to restrict the

146
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:11,170
current and this gives us a lot of very
beneficial advantages I suppose so

147
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:16,180
for a start what we do to to look into
these devices is we create computer

148
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:22,660
models we simulate we fabricate and then
we measure we test these devices

149
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:27,459
so the way we do this is we use computer
software that will solve some fairly

150
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:32,920
complex equations in semiconductor
physics we discretize these so we told

151
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,120
the computer where precisely to solve
the equations of course you want better

152
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:43,510
accuracy in the places where you want
the data to be quite precise and then

153
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:48,220
you get something like this and this is
a bunch of electrical characteristics of

154
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:51,760
a transistor working in an analog
fashion

155
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,350
so as you sweep the voltage on the on
the egg scale you turn the current up

156
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:03,880
from virtually zero to something that he
could call Bob sizable I suppose

157
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,810
and then we make them we make them with
fairly conventional technologies like

158
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,439
this one with photo lithography the way
we've always made by Jerry electronics

159
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:18,160
but we make them with printing as well
and then we test them and then we get

160
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,209
fairly similar electrical
characteristics

161
00:13:21,209 --> 00:13:28,768
so I mentioned printing and the idea
here with this device the cleverness of

162
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:35,100
it is that it can withstand significant
tolerance or process variations so here

163
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:42,509
what i'm showing which you can't really
see I suppose is the two curves for two

164
00:13:42,509 --> 00:13:47,819
devices that are 10 times different one
is about 20 microns what about 200

165
00:13:47,819 --> 00:13:53,610
microns long and we get exactly the same
characteristics which is not something

166
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:56,459
that you normally get from a
conventional transistor and this is

167
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,239
fairly important because what this means
is that when you're printing at very

168
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:05,639
high speed and the picture on the bottom
really shows a deliberately bad print of

169
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:09,839
two parallel lines when you're printing
at extremely high speed this transistor

170
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,089
will have exactly the same performance
regardless of the waviness of the of the

171
00:14:15,089 --> 00:14:18,569
lines or the distance between them

172
00:14:18,569 --> 00:14:22,769
so this means very robust electronics on
plastic on paper

173
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:28,860
you name it so this device is
particularly energy-efficient it gets to

174
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,350
the problem of uniformity and it is high
gain as in you can make very high

175
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:38,459
amplification devices out of it and
circuit

176
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,790
it has downsides as well of course one
is speed so because we are restricting

177
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:48,719
the current as it enters the device at
the metal contact

178
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:53,339
we're probably losing about ninety
percent of what this device could go at

179
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:58,470
and in terms of its switching speed and
because of the physics the current

180
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:03,209
passing through it is very
temperature-dependent that is probably a

181
00:15:03,209 --> 00:15:06,628
major downside and it's different

182
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:12,119
probably his biggest problem is that is
different industry works on for six or

183
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:15,929
eight years time scales and if you come
up with a new idea

184
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:19,920
that's good for I don't know next year's
product

185
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,579
it's never going to be incorporated
because people have have thought of what

186
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:28,138
they're going to be doing for a number
of years so it's quite hard to actually

187
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,680
get this

188
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:36,819
into into industry we saw the
temperature problem with some some

189
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:42,820
fairly clever simulations and i'm a show
you if we have time and the speed is not

190
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:47,500
entirely problematic for the very simple
reason that we're not trying to create

191
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:51,640
processors and graphics card we're
trying to create very simple electronics

192
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,709
which will probably go at a few hundred
Hertz or a few tens of kilohertz at the

193
00:15:56,709 --> 00:15:59,709
maximum so this isn't really a problem
in the real world

194
00:16:00,370 --> 00:16:04,600
I'll show you really briefly how this
behaves in comparison with a

195
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,890
conventional transistor

196
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:10,390
so you can use the transistor as a
current source and ideally a current

197
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,149
source would look like this

198
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:16,779
irrespective of the supply voltage you
should get exactly the same amount of

199
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:23,260
current and you should start getting
that current from the moment you apply a

200
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,689
minut voltage across it

201
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:30,160
this is the ideal characteristic of a
transistor as a current source current

202
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,779
devices look a bit like this

203
00:16:31,779 --> 00:16:37,089
so of course the flatter the
characteristics are the better the

204
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,890
source gate of transistor looks like
that

205
00:16:38,890 --> 00:16:42,730
so what we're going to be doing and I'm
going to show you two videos of again

206
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:47,110
lighting up a simple led by passing by
passing current through this transistor

207
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,140
and in turn driving the LED with current

208
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:53,680
so what we're going to do is we're going
to sweep these characteristics

209
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:59,229
so we're going to go from large high
voltage all the way to zero and back

210
00:16:59,230 --> 00:16:59,830
again

211
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,839
a number of times on the same curve
first on the TFG and then on the sgt

212
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:08,889
and what's going to happen is that the
TFT the conventional thin film

213
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:13,510
transistor is going to drive the LED
with increasingly lower and lower

214
00:17:13,510 --> 00:17:17,260
current so the brightness going to drop
until eventually it goes down to zero

215
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:21,459
and then you're going to see this
happening a couple of times the second

216
00:17:21,459 --> 00:17:25,510
film is about the source gate transistor
where as you might expect from the graph

217
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:30,490
the currents going to stay virtually the
same for the majority of the . so the

218
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:34,660
LED is going to have the same brightness
until very low supply voltages

219
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:39,670
so here is it

220
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:44,260
and see right at the bottom is the
supply voltage which is negative and

221
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,690
then you can see the tiny LED losing
brightness and being off for the

222
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:56,710
majority of this . and if we go to Sgt
driven sorry

223
00:17:56,710 --> 00:18:04,510
here we go so it's the same period the
same time frame for this process but the

224
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:08,230
LED stays on for longer of the . and it
doesn't lose its brightness

225
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:14,080
this is with the same tech with the same
technology in fabrication but using this

226
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,199
trick of controlling the current at this
metal semiconductor contact

227
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,570
so as I said we can make these with
conventional technologies but also with

228
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,850
armed printing

229
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:29,590
let's stop type in jet printers stamping
spray coating that sort of thing

230
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,290
so this or gate transistor is a very
useful device for flexible and printed

231
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,320
electronics because its robust and its
light energy efficient and it has this

232
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,270
this property of uniformity

233
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:48,940
but it's only part of the story because
apart from very good electronic devices

234
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:55,120
you need to come up with feeds or ideas
that you couldn't realize before with

235
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:58,120
conventional technology i'm just going
to show you a couple of things that

236
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:02,139
people have been doing around the world
in the area of printed electronics

237
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:08,830
so this was last year a fully
functioning microprocessor made by

238
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,439
inkjet printing in Belgium

239
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,310
now the problem with this one is that
it's about the same performance as

240
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:23,350
something coming out of 1972 in silicon
technology but it's just the beginning

241
00:19:23,350 --> 00:19:27,580
and it's very likely that we're going to
be able to do exactly the same thing

242
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:33,370
akin to moore's law with these types of
transistors in these types of

243
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:36,550
technologies in Japan

244
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:42,190
check out some AR is working on very
thin printed electronics

245
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,930
so this thing is an array of sensors
that will you put presumably on your

246
00:19:46,930 --> 00:19:49,650
body to to monitor your hair

247
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:54,750
the interesting thing about it is there
is just one micron thick again when you

248
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:58,440
talk about nanotechnology that the
stereotypical comparison is the width of

249
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:01,200
a human hair 50 nanometers or 80
nanometers

250
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,340
so this is absolutely feather-light
electronics or feather for the weight

251
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,600
rather electronics

252
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:10,350
so this is how they imagine that this
might work you stick it on it would send

253
00:20:10,350 --> 00:20:13,620
some data wirelessly would be powered
wirelessly and then when you don't need

254
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:21,929
it it would either peel off or even
absorb in the US and a banana champagne

255
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:26,730
John Rogers is working on transient
electronics

256
00:20:26,730 --> 00:20:31,950
so these are things that can be
dissolved either if you're ingesting

257
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:35,400
them and they stay in the body for a
couple weeks and then they just simply

258
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:40,470
are dissolved or things that you put in
the environment and they are either

259
00:20:40,470 --> 00:20:49,260
water soluble or with very let's say not
nasty chemicals so a a great deal of

260
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:55,830
effort is now looking into the ecology
of these things because this could be a

261
00:20:55,830 --> 00:21:00,030
new beginning for the whole of the
industry of electronics right there new

262
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:03,240
materials there are new substrates to
put things on

263
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:08,370
why not do it in a in a an ecological
fashion and again in the US at Stanford

264
00:21:08,370 --> 00:21:12,750
they're looking at Stampin this array of
electrodes onto some flakes of

265
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:18,180
semiconductor which are quite randomly
put around the the substrate but the

266
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,500
idea is that if you need something
extremely low cost

267
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:26,580
perhaps just sprinkling the
semiconductor on a substrate at random

268
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:33,090
and only working with the devices that
that work by by accident is probably a

269
00:21:33,090 --> 00:21:34,290
good way of doing it

270
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:38,430
so this is this is general bow who's the
doing this sort of research and again my

271
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:42,330
friend children war after shanghai
jiaotong university who is a sarah

272
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:49,350
graduate i should say he's looking at a
lot of anti-counterfeiting biosensors

273
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:54,780
chemical sensors on the flexible in
printed electronics again extremely low

274
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:59,160
cost and things that eventually you
would be able to to print in your own

275
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,850
home

276
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,389
but speaking of printed transistors

277
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:07,799
this is the work of hunting searing
house when he was a post talk about 15

278
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:13,889
years ago and he developed the first
fully printed organic transistor and

279
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:17,970
just printed it with an inkjet printer i
gotta with the variety of materials

280
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:24,928
semiconductors conductors and insulators
fast for about 15 years and engineering

281
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:29,070
house is still one of the pioneers of
printed electronics

282
00:22:29,789 --> 00:22:37,350
he's in cambridge and he started this
company called Plastic Logic and plastic

283
00:22:37,350 --> 00:22:46,530
logic made this which is a fully
bendable display screen right

284
00:22:46,530 --> 00:22:50,158
plastic display screens are you looking
at if you can even see it

285
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:54,150
it's a black and white image a bit like
a kindle display but this is the image

286
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:58,320
latched into this flat flexible plastic
display

287
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:02,189
now this is from a couple of years ago
they've let me show it to people you're

288
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:04,799
more than welcome to have a look at it
afterwards

289
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:10,980
these days they can do full color video
rate display screens in this size

290
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:18,539
so this is absolutely fantastic because
surely it means that this is the coming

291
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:23,970
of age of plastic electronics ride these
things are happening but the fact is we

292
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,559
can't really buy them

293
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:31,620
so is this really the future well it is
the future in some sense but if you

294
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,428
think about it if you were to compare
the the technology of communications to

295
00:23:38,429 --> 00:23:40,409
the technology of printed electronics

296
00:23:40,409 --> 00:23:44,309
we're not even at this stage in terms of
our development with more like at this

297
00:23:44,309 --> 00:23:45,210
stage

298
00:23:45,210 --> 00:23:49,020
so even though there are plenty of
companies and plenty of research groups

299
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,600
doing amazing stuff with new materials
and new techniques we hardly hear

300
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,970
so to get here

301
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:03,030
we need a lot more understanding of the
basic process is a lot more

302
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,530
understanding of the engineering but a
very good reason for doing things

303
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:14,908
because in this era of commoditization
of electronics is very easy to say okay

304
00:24:14,909 --> 00:24:19,590
I'm going to build the same thing faster
or cheaper but eventually you're running

305
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:25,408
out of reasons to work to make things so
the key is enabling completely new

306
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:30,809
applications things that you couldn't do
with rigid or just conventional silicon

307
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:40,320
technology and part of this I think is a
doing or marrying old technologies with

308
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,418
brand new ones

309
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:47,820
i'm going to show you two demos which
have very very rough and ready of two

310
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:53,760
technologies where printed electronics
would work fairly well and would be

311
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,309
seamlessly integrated in everyday
products

312
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:03,389
so the first one is a photo book which
has ambient sound as you turn the pages

313
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:08,070
of the sound changes for a soundscape of
course you can do much more with it but

314
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:10,470
the the demo is about that

315
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:14,760
so that's it

316
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:25,250
the best vantage point to get some shots
of the annual pass lying

317
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:31,970
you can see here and the sound you can
hear is cockatoos two huge ones fighting

318
00:25:31,970 --> 00:25:34,970
and Flying swing as such

319
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:46,970
so the book is effectively becomes the
trigger for digital events or it becomes

320
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,000
the remote control for interacting with
digital content the the other demo we've

321
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:58,400
made for for a little project last year
was a packaging box which tells you in

322
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:03,140
your own language instructions for
putting together a piece of fun eh SI

323
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:09,410
and the idea is that you can navigate by
gestures through the steps of of the

324
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:13,940
building process the point again is that
we've made this with off-the-shelf

325
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,330
components but the idea is that you
would be able to integrate absolutely

326
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,699
every bit of the electronic system into
the cardboard in a printing process so

327
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,700
it be dirty eventually

328
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,320
welcome to ikea drug and steps

329
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:39,490
it's recording together with the manual
supplied should make the process of

330
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:40,659
building your steps

331
00:26:40,659 --> 00:26:47,049
easy you're missing God's here and
easily order them on the website that I

332
00:26:47,049 --> 00:26:48,950
care

333
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:54,200
one begin by tapping the dolls and the
two-step panels and attaching them to

334
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,250
the side panel

335
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:59,280
to make sure

336
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:10,830
additional support is facing in the
corrector and so on paper and printed

337
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:15,659
electronics is a big deal these days
mostly to do with recycling and with

338
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:20,910
again the ecology side of things and in
fact the European Union minutes after

339
00:27:20,910 --> 00:27:26,010
breaks it announced that there will be a
funding opportunity later this year for

340
00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:28,980
paper-based electronics and we're trying
to capitalize on that

341
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:36,360
following on from these little demos
right so where do we go from him

342
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:44,520
my feeling is that the whole idea from
now on it will be from a sorry i should

343
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,190
say that in a different way

344
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:52,530
what needs to happen for new
applications for completely new ways of

345
00:27:52,530 --> 00:27:58,260
using electronics for giving us a reason
to make these flexible electronics is to

346
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:02,550
marry the interaction with real-world
objects things like the Internet of

347
00:28:02,550 --> 00:28:09,300
Things broadly speaking with distributed
data as in the cloud and big data and we

348
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:10,830
can easily do this

349
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:15,389
following the Digital side of things
with that immense computer and power

350
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:19,230
that we have and with the analog which
is coming from the printed sensors and

351
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:20,490
the printed electronics

352
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:25,980
so what's next well at this point
genuinely your guess is as good as mine

353
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:29,340
and for that reason I'm going to ask you
for your thoughts

354
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:33,060
perhaps by the large tree outside

355
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:36,810
thank you very much for listening

356
00:28:39,260 --> 00:28:47,690
yeah
