1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,030
welcome to

2
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:14,510
my second ever

3
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:20,840
and I speak I speak here in twenty
twelve on women in computing and they

4
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,720
asked me to come back but I didn't
really want to talk about women's stuff

5
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:24,320
again

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,210
so I thought I talk about something else
with a subtext of Randy women stuff just

7
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:29,930
for fun

8
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:36,050
and so this is a talk about working with
school kids and trying to get school

9
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:40,220
kids excited about computer science and
about computing and about computational

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:44,480
thinking about coding and that kind of
stuff and but before we go into any

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,919
detail about that

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,190
I guess the question I should probably
addresses who am I to tell you about

13
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:50,180
this stuff

14
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,390
and there might be some school teachers
in the room there might be some people

15
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,350
who know a lot more about this than me
on so i thought i'd give a quick

16
00:00:57,350 --> 00:01:03,799
overview of the kinds of things I've
done in this particular domain so and

17
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:12,440
for about the last 10 years I've been
doing stuff with I schools outreach from

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:17,658
my job as a lecturer in computer science
say as best part of the university's

19
00:01:17,659 --> 00:01:22,220
outreach mission to go into schools and
engage with school kids and it's also

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,970
probably shouldn't talk about this as
much but it's also part of our marketing

21
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,350
because if people go into schools and do
a good show it's time to advertisers the

22
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:33,830
University and and is also huge fun

23
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,830
so I've been under project technique
camps which was a massive European

24
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:38,510
project looking at

25
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:43,550
we went into every school in weight loss
i think with that project and I'd as

26
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:48,860
much smaller project called gals which
stands for get on with science and that

27
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:51,920
was kind of fun and full of doing all
sorts of things with the local school

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,870
and I'm a stem ambassador so I was this
goes in that way

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:01,280
I got to talk a bit more about that
particular aspect later and i have this

30
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,240
android programming day which i wrote
which has been run

31
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,199
I think about 200 times now it's a
Creative Commons workshop you can just

32
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:14,238
download it and run it if you want to do
it and and i'm on this playful coding

33
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,440
project which is looking across europe
at getting playful activities to engage

34
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:24,139
kids with coding and with computation in
a creative and kind of open and playful

35
00:02:24,139 --> 00:02:27,250
way and I've finally the one in the
bottom

36
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:32,080
IRC is the apparatus with robotics club
which is an after-school Club where we

37
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,880
get notes in and we build robots and
then sometimes they fight the robots or

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:40,780
sometimes they don't depend upon what
kind of robot is and that picture itself

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,890
is of course me with my first computer
and so right that's who I am to tell you

40
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:48,369
about this I know quite a lot about
computers and quite a lot about schools

41
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:53,950
and I call out about doing stuff with
which is fun and say

42
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:59,380
and in order to convince you that this
kind of activity is worthwhile i think

43
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:04,810
it's important to so take a step back
and think about why why would you even

44
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:10,540
bother trying to engage kids with this
kind of stuff and there's a sense in

45
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:15,640
which computing is more more embedded in
the curriculum now so schools are doing

46
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,399
more of this stuff but it's not
necessarily done in the most

47
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:27,820
entertaining or engaging way and I think
it's kind of important to see computing

48
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:31,930
not just as a means of getting a better
job although that is a obviously a

49
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:36,370
motivation for a lot of people and but
also something that kind of gives you a

50
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,840
cognitive toolkit for dealing with other
kinds of problems and this cut this

51
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,390
concept computational thinking was
introduced by jeanette wing and in a

52
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:50,440
little article computation of thinking
you can find it in the communications of

53
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,769
the ACM it's actually really easy to
read it's only like three pages or

54
00:03:53,769 --> 00:03:56,890
something but it blew my mind when i
read it the first time it's really

55
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,268
concise and it talks about how being a
computationally literally gives you a

56
00:04:01,269 --> 00:04:03,579
new tool kit for dealing with the world

57
00:04:03,579 --> 00:04:07,780
so you approach problem solving in a
different way those ideas of algorithms

58
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,170
as ideas sequences these ideas of
control that you use when you're

59
00:04:11,170 --> 00:04:14,470
debugging a washing machine as much as
when you're debugging some code yeah

60
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:21,909
and the idea of senses and responses and
reactions and looping and scale and

61
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,020
abstraction

62
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:27,700
all of these things are absolutely cause
of computing and computer science and

63
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:35,500
also call to and science in general and
maybe it's just cuz i'm a bit of a nerd

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,070
but they're the kinds of concepts are
using my everyday life as well

65
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,800
and

66
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,430
not that I'm the kind of person that
writes an algorithm for making a cup of

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:48,620
tea but as you can to kind of idea and
so computation of thinking if we don't

68
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:52,280
teach our kids this stuff then they're
missing out on something that's actually

69
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:56,929
really useful for them as a kind of way
of interacting with the world so that's

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,169
reason one to do this yeah

71
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:05,930
and the second reason to do this is that
computing is an inherently fun activity

72
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:10,610
and and if you're teaching computing
through the medium of spreadsheet

73
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:14,419
I think you might find that difficult to
convince people of but if you're

74
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:18,020
teaching computer through the medium of
something like scratch then

75
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,469
actually there's some really cool fun
things you can do with it

76
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:25,520
so I've made a huge mistake of clicking
a link on a windows machine

77
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:30,919
are heavier so this is a test at gallery
of the projects that were inspired by a

78
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:36,889
visit to such salvador dali museum and
then they're just animations and they're

79
00:05:36,889 --> 00:05:41,240
just silly animations that I'm enable
you to play with the concepts of dollars

80
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,669
paintings and it's a kind of daily
hackathon that we did but it's just it's

81
00:05:46,669 --> 00:05:47,568
playful

82
00:05:47,569 --> 00:05:51,889
it's interesting it's exciting is
artistic it's nothing to do with

83
00:05:51,889 --> 00:05:53,060
spreadsheets

84
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:55,880
but the kinds of concepts that you're
working with when you're doing this kind

85
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,930
of stuff are the kinds of concepts that
you can then need to apply and different

86
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:02,960
yeah thanks for that ok

87
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:06,979
huh right

88
00:06:06,979 --> 00:06:15,139
so yeah I know I had to borrow a laptop
because my laptops too old and the

89
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:20,779
presentation stuff doesn't have a vga
connector and my laptop doesn't have

90
00:06:20,779 --> 00:06:26,569
anything else so and i'm not normally
this technologically incompetent I

91
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:27,440
assure you

92
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,699
ok so computer science is fun right when
you do when you're programming you're

93
00:06:31,699 --> 00:06:35,240
quite literally building things out of
ideas and I can't think of anything more

94
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:38,479
exciting than that when it works well or
anything more frustrating than that when

95
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,409
it doesn't work well but unless people
get the chance to try it then they're

96
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:45,259
not really going to be able to know
whoever they were the kind of people

97
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:46,940
that would enjoy doing it

98
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:51,380
so we have to kind of show people to the
playful and creative side of these

99
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,360
things

100
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:58,030
having said that and the whole getting a
good job thing is not a major motivator

101
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:03,609
and you don't have to be motivated by
money to be concerned about the fact

102
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:07,000
that the number of buckets of money that
come in as it's going to be slightly

103
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,560
larger than the number of buckets of
money that go out right and so and the

104
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,449
fact that computer science leads to a
reasonably good job in many cases is

105
00:07:16,449 --> 00:07:22,150
reason to try and push this in our
schools and particularly for and

106
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:27,159
particularly with groups that don't
necessarily engage with computing which

107
00:07:27,159 --> 00:07:31,719
is going to bring me neatly onto my next
slide where I stuff and have a bit of a

108
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:37,479
rant and I don't know what the gender
ratio is a MF camp and I haven't asked

109
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,639
for the figures but i'm going to guess
it's about twenty percent women because

110
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,289
it feels a bit better than normal for me
and just looking around the place and

111
00:07:47,289 --> 00:07:51,068
walking around the place and computer
science generally you're looking at

112
00:07:51,069 --> 00:07:57,250
fifteen percent and that does Pancks
particularly given the fact that

113
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,029
computer science is it is it is a
discipline that leads to good jobs

114
00:08:01,029 --> 00:08:04,479
particularly given the fact that
computer science is something that's fun

115
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:08,529
particularly given the fact that
computer science can be really creative

116
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:13,900
and really at exciting and but we have
we're in a situation where girls just

117
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,929
aren't getting involved

118
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:21,490
they're getting turned off and getting
turned off it really early and so that's

119
00:08:21,490 --> 00:08:22,569
the other reason

120
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:26,229
particularly women should be engaging
with this stuff you can't be what you

121
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:27,159
can't see

122
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:32,409
so if everybody this the kids see who's
doing computing is guy then you can

123
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:35,828
assume that computing is something
that's done bye guys

124
00:08:35,828 --> 00:08:41,859
and so I think it's kind of important to
kind of encourage the kids to think

125
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:47,350
about doing this really quite fun and
exciting thing because it might get them

126
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:51,940
money it might get a rewarding job but
it might not be for them but the moment

127
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:55,990
they're not even getting the chance to
see whether it's for them so and that's

128
00:08:55,990 --> 00:09:02,020
my kind of Y and the next bit is to work
as a kind of a section which I think of

129
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,880
is how

130
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,090
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
run through some different types of

131
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:10,950
engagement activity the ID and then talk
about the pros and cons of each one with

132
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:19,560
regard to look at in the kids on board
yeah so and the the first thing i want

133
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:24,000
to talk about is the address with
robotics club and a dress with red boys

134
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,190
club is an after-school Club for kids
from the local secondary schools we take

135
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:33,660
kids from 11 and we've got a great for
beginners and we got a group of advanced

136
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:37,800
kids and this is a set of beginners with
some of our student ambassadors and the

137
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,760
22 students you can see three students
you can see standing there all under

138
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,880
graduates with us to help our in the
club so they get quite a lot of it as

139
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,570
well and we have a kind of project based
approach for the for the little ones so

140
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,340
that 11 12 year olds follow a kind of
curriculum and that the other kids do

141
00:09:56,340 --> 00:10:00,900
whatever they want so the divide what's
the little ones were building these know

142
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:04,530
because the magician chassis is because
that's the maker of the chassis and

143
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:08,400
they've got a scoop on the front which
lifts up and down with her an actuator

144
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
and I've got motors and they decorate
themselves with googly eyes because

145
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,590
everything experiment googly eyes and
the the aim is to do a little robot

146
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,830
course and you lift up scoop and
everything and it's all about building

147
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,490
it

148
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:23,790
programming it designing it decorating
it paint it pink

149
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:29,760
that kind of stuff yet and so that's the
new bc yeah and the advanced kids

150
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,990
this they basically do what they want so
this is a Cyberman head

151
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:41,040
someone got from a garage sale or a boot
sale or something and and it's got some

152
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,849
neopixel eyes that change color
depending upon how close things are

153
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:49,230
it's got a raspberry pie with a pie camp
and you can see the Blues the blue thing

154
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:54,570
on the screen behind it is the view from
inside the Cyber man's head and we're

155
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:58,230
going to get face recognition we've got
a face recognition working and I've got

156
00:10:58,230 --> 00:11:01,320
a voice changing thing and I recorded
some Cyberman voices

157
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:05,130
so you walk up to it and other side
man's voice if it sees your face which

158
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:10,899
is for 14 year old apparently really
exciting and other projects we've got

159
00:11:10,899 --> 00:11:16,420
James if the Technicolor 3d printed
robot and his arms falling off its on

160
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,829
the table next to him and I don't know
if you can see there's a sort of models

161
00:11:20,829 --> 00:11:24,219
head with some glasses there's an
ultrasonic glasses for the blind

162
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:27,459
there are couple of 15 year old boys are
building where they tell a distance and

163
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:29,859
play sounds in your ears to see which
ones

164
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:36,069
further of narrow so that's kind of cool
as well and so that's really what club

165
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:41,649
and it's brilliant it's exciting it's
probably the best two hours of my week

166
00:11:41,649 --> 00:11:44,319
and most weeks

167
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:51,248
don't tell my husband and but the the
thing is you see we wanted to get a new

168
00:11:51,249 --> 00:11:54,579
boy boobies in in September

169
00:11:54,579 --> 00:12:00,910
so I said I want 50 50 I said I'm of I
want two girls I want ten boys at that

170
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:05,290
for me is the perfect in duration for
robotics club so we went into all the

171
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:09,670
local schools and it wasn't me going
into the local schools because i'm aware

172
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:13,449
that i'm not the most girly of girls we
got we got Casey she's a 3rd year

173
00:12:13,449 --> 00:12:19,870
physics student she's a proper super
robotics person and she's also very very

174
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:23,709
good at being girly and she was the one
that went in and she said we want 10

175
00:12:23,709 --> 00:12:25,268
boys we want ten girls from it

176
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:28,389
we want everybody to apply and you fill
in the form and everything and at the

177
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:33,579
end of the recruitment phase we had i
think twenty six guys and three girls

178
00:12:34,329 --> 00:12:40,239
so we went for ten boys and three girls
because that would be better than making

179
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,649
the race area more skewed only thing
that why these are eleven year olds you

180
00:12:44,649 --> 00:12:46,389
know why they put off so early

181
00:12:46,389 --> 00:12:50,920
how does this happen how does this
happen so and I think this is kind of

182
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:55,329
like code clubs there and you quite
often get this week 0 clubs as well and

183
00:12:55,329 --> 00:12:59,859
what you've got going on with clubs
general is that their massive fun to run

184
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:05,049
and for someone like me is partnered is
really good fun to be with other people

185
00:13:05,049 --> 00:13:08,379
who are young and just finding this
stuff out and it doesn't really matter

186
00:13:08,379 --> 00:13:13,059
if they're boys or girls really but and
you have really high impact on some kids

187
00:13:13,059 --> 00:13:16,480
yes so that that that the three kids who
come to my book club

188
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,889
they are learning so much

189
00:13:17,889 --> 00:13:21,639
so quickly and you wouldn't believe how
quickly an 11 year old can pick things

190
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:25,509
up if they've got an individual
undergraduate help us sing excellent

191
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:29,259
they just raised his head but you only
ever dealing with the ones that are

192
00:13:29,259 --> 00:13:30,160
already clean

193
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:33,009
yeah you're dealing with them with
people who already part of the in club

194
00:13:33,009 --> 00:13:35,499
and getting the girls in

195
00:13:35,499 --> 00:13:40,600
we've really worked at this year when we
haven't succeeded so that's my thought

196
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,249
about engaging through clubs

197
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:45,459
I'm going to continue doing it because
the impact on the kids that you were

198
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:49,899
with a great and it's just so fun but I
don't have a solution to the girls

199
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,100
problem with that one

200
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:56,769
and so the next type of engagement I
want to talk about is the kind of family

201
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:57,850
in vent

202
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,199
so do quite a few kind of family events
where we've got we get people in on a

203
00:14:02,199 --> 00:14:05,349
Saturday and it's a coding family fun
day

204
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,329
oh it's a family birthday and we get big
brothers and your sisters and mothers

205
00:14:10,329 --> 00:14:11,979
and sons and all sorts

206
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,459
so we have got an android programming
one and we've got a great part 61 like a

207
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:16,689
Lego robotics one

208
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:20,290
and what happens is that the parents
come in with the kids and they spend

209
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,860
whole day there and we involve the
parents and the activities to a certain

210
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:28,629
extent so for the Ray but when we
actually get the kids to write a program

211
00:14:28,629 --> 00:14:33,069
to program a humanoid robot to follow in
a salt bath and then we told her parents

212
00:14:33,069 --> 00:14:36,248
that they are the humanoid robot but I
haven't got any eyes

213
00:14:36,249 --> 00:14:40,209
so the kids get to sort of program their
parents to walk around the room

214
00:14:40,209 --> 00:14:44,258
blindfold which kind of works quite
nicely as a kind of exciting activity

215
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:50,649
that makes parents trip up and I think
these kinds of activity as slightly more

216
00:14:50,649 --> 00:14:58,869
and slightly more useful from a kind of
outreach perspective because this

217
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:03,339
they're really fun to run and but
perhaps most importantly you might

218
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:06,910
change the parental perceptions of what
computing is about and who does

219
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:11,259
computing and and actually when you
think about who is going to be

220
00:15:11,259 --> 00:15:14,529
influencing the kids more if you can
change the parents minds about what

221
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,869
computer scientists looks like that's
probably going to have more of an impact

222
00:15:16,869 --> 00:15:22,929
and more broadly and it also gives
parents something to do in a damp

223
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:27,100
saturday so after my android programming
workshop I bumped into one of the moms

224
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:32,379
in Morrison's and she's like she's still
doing it you know she's still doing it

225
00:15:32,379 --> 00:15:35,769
she gets half an hour and a damn
saturday she's not watching YouTube

226
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,739
she's writing android apps and you think
that's kind of cool

227
00:15:38,739 --> 00:15:44,110
say that kind of giving people the
opportunity to work on things on their

228
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:44,679
own

229
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:50,919
after the event is also very useful and
the the cons of this kind of thing

230
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:53,679
you don't always make super progress
because you only ever do it for a day

231
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,949
and a day means three hours really
because you've got the set up in the

232
00:15:56,949 --> 00:16:02,289
install and a lunch break and the coffee
break an the people turning up late and

233
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:05,860
crowd control and somebody laptop
doesn't work

234
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:09,909
so you're probably looking at three
hours and so you don't get a huge amount

235
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:15,399
done and and you are generally again
you're looking at the Keen ones you're

236
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:19,509
looking at the people who have chosen to
give up a saturday to do this

237
00:16:20,019 --> 00:16:24,850
they're probably either fairly clean
already or they've got clean parents and

238
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:30,970
so there's you again you're probably not
getting everybody who might be

239
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:35,799
influenced in this particular situation
when we did the rail book mindstorms day

240
00:16:35,799 --> 00:16:39,699
down in temperature in a church for one
of the mums ran in at the end of it and

241
00:16:39,699 --> 00:16:45,729
said he just said it was the best day of
his life as a wow I don't what does that

242
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,439
say about anyway

243
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,110
I'm

244
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:53,120
so and I've only got one picture slide
for this one because I've got hundreds

245
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:56,899
of pictures of things that look just
like this and I'm what this picture is

246
00:16:56,899 --> 00:17:00,290
representing is actually going into
schools and haven't got a lot of

247
00:17:00,290 --> 00:17:04,280
pictures of going into schools because
photos schools very difficult to take

248
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,270
going to get permission all that kind of
stuff so I got lots of photos of screens

249
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:13,459
but not necessarily schools and this is
a workshop called and respect you

250
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:15,439
basically make a clock in scratch

251
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,439
so you are programming the clock that's
going to work out the angles got to go

252
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:21,799
tick tick tick they could choose their
own hands they can choose their own

253
00:17:21,799 --> 00:17:25,189
front for the number they could color
things in you get people with cars as

254
00:17:25,189 --> 00:17:30,260
hands or footballers or whatever and and
this is a virtue of my different nine

255
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:33,950
year olds in the local primary school
and and what we did is we said we want

256
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,340
to do join us to a coating morning and
they said yeah you can do all of this

257
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:45,799
year so that they had tech or morning so
we went in and we had half the year in

258
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:49,760
the first period and healthier and
second . so we had the whole of that

259
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,929
particular cohort and and that's one of
the things you can do with schools that

260
00:17:53,929 --> 00:17:57,890
you can't do with specific events where
you're inviting people in

261
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:01,309
yeah you can actually get everyone you
know you're getting all the girls

262
00:18:01,309 --> 00:18:03,168
because you're getting all of the people

263
00:18:03,169 --> 00:18:07,820
yeah so I do really i think schools
workshops and going into schools and

264
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:14,600
doing that kind of just a couple of
hours working through something with a

265
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,360
whole class can be really valuable and
if you insist on seeing the whole class

266
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:26,809
rather than a club you do get to see
everyone obviously and my schools are

267
00:18:26,809 --> 00:18:32,360
I'm more than okay with people coming in
to help out and are actually quite keen

268
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:36,559
to have people come in particularly
given the current emphasis on computing

269
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,230
in the curriculum if you've got
computing skills and you got

270
00:18:39,230 --> 00:18:42,860
communication skills and you want to get
involved it's perfectly plausible to

271
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:49,850
contact your local school and ask them
nicely and the in the UK DBS is a kind

272
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:54,559
of major things so in order to go into a
school you have to have a DBS check

273
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:56,960
which means that you've been checked
against the criminal records bureau

274
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:00,570
everything and getting a DBS checking

275
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:04,590
cost money but if you register as a stem
ambassador with Stemler

276
00:19:04,590 --> 00:19:09,059
they'll sort it all out for you so
that's a top tip if you want to go into

277
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,668
schools registers a stem ambassador

278
00:19:11,669 --> 00:19:17,490
they'll do the checking you'll get a
storm ambassadors and ID card and you'll

279
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,580
get the proper paperwork and you'll be
able to approach the school and say look

280
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:25,199
I'm here is a stem ambassador and then
the school's know about this scheme and

281
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:29,399
it's all about getting scientists and
technologists into schools to help with

282
00:19:29,399 --> 00:19:35,610
the curriculum enrichment stuff and take
your engagement can be hard

283
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:39,330
so quite often if you're in a school and
you've got a whole class the teacher

284
00:19:39,330 --> 00:19:40,649
might decide to

285
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:45,209
I don't go off to another room yet they
shouldn't do this because they should be

286
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:48,149
in the class with you and one of the
things that's really good as when the

287
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:53,549
teacher gets involved and then is able
to run the activities themselves it

288
00:19:53,549 --> 00:19:57,029
going on I've got a couple of teachers i
worked quite closely with her able to

289
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,029
actually carry on the workshops that
we've been doing together on their own

290
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:01,200
and that's brilliant

291
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,169
but there are other schools I worked
with work go in there and as soon as I

292
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,370
turn up the teachers go and have a cup
of coffee and I obviously those things

293
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,570
for them to be getting on with

294
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:11,970
but it would be really nice if there's a
little bit of help with crowd control

295
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:17,039
because most of my training regarding
crowd controllers to do with 21 year old

296
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,908
shit how'd you come down a class a
nine-year-old if there's not a teacher

297
00:20:20,909 --> 00:20:21,450
there

298
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:25,889
I don't know and so yeah and you can
take as many photos but that's not

299
00:20:25,889 --> 00:20:27,059
really a downside

300
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:32,820
and so yeah last time event i'm going to
talk about is a kind of random selection

301
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:40,168
of events and these are kind of and
doing outreach it displays and festivals

302
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:47,909
and one offs in schools and so on say
these factors here are from the i step

303
00:20:47,909 --> 00:20:52,019
foot which is a big festival in ways
that i went to a monday and we've got

304
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:56,220
some vr glasses and machine kids a
roller coaster on the surface of Mars

305
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:59,909
which is kind of a cool thing to have
and what you're looking at here is

306
00:20:59,909 --> 00:21:03,779
encouraging students coming to get kids
to think of something exciting

307
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,840
associated with computing but you're
probably only going to have them for

308
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,470
like 5-10 minutes because they're just
rolling through

309
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:11,510
and they're going to stop when you got
to have something that makes them very

310
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,280
well for five or ten minutes

311
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:17,780
very different to having like a 15-week
curriculum for the robot club or a

312
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:23,720
three-hour session when you go into
school and so this is a shot from a

313
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,610
really quite bunkers de corps Pythagoras
day and what we took over the local

314
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:32,270
museum with a whole set of different
installations and all of the schools but

315
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,879
their people in to look at these
installations different ways that

316
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:41,210
Pythagoras influence things and I'm this
is actually a colleague of mine and

317
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:45,110
contact any credit from this just I was
just I just like holding stuff rather

318
00:21:45,110 --> 00:21:48,740
than designing it but they sent her a
high-altitude balloon up with a local

319
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,970
primary school and that Lego men in a
little case that went off into space it

320
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:56,750
took photographs and and that's one
another one of those kind of really big

321
00:21:56,750 --> 00:22:00,380
high impact things that makes people go
home wow you could do that with

322
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:05,179
computers you can see where it is and
then it was why it was so when a signal

323
00:22:05,179 --> 00:22:12,470
so they lost the balloon anyway and and
then this is and I was on holiday in

324
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:15,830
Malawi and we went to the local school
and so can we do something and they said

325
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:21,740
yes and we turned up and I said you've
got all of the air three in year 5 which

326
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,179
is all of the 15 year olds and all of
the 13 notes as a how many is that they

327
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:29,570
said 250 everyone ok ok

328
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:34,399
250 people know computers are too so we
did the program a robot with a blindfold

329
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:40,220
exercise and that was kind of cool and
that's what kind of that's kind of more

330
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,210
like fun

331
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,340
and then influencing people to go into
computing as a career but i think we

332
00:22:46,340 --> 00:22:50,510
probably gave them a session that they
can remember if nothing else

333
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,309
and so I'm going to finish office and
talk about project that I've been

334
00:22:55,309 --> 00:22:58,250
working on and of things that you

335
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,100
you guys if you want to go and do this
stuff you can just pick it up and take

336
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:05,870
it and the project is called playful
coding and I don't know

337
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,370
can you see there's a map here that's
like I know and it doesn't miss good and

338
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:14,959
so this is the EU project is coming to
the end coming to an end at the end of

339
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:21,110
august are what a shame and getting new
you project is going to be complicated

340
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,830
because

341
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:31,139
but anyway this was very good i was very
pleased with a lot of excellent work it

342
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:35,610
would be great if we could continue as
for university schools on private

343
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:41,490
company in the UK France Spain Italy

344
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:46,559
romania and and we were really closely
together we picked up workshops hydrogen

345
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:50,519
and they got run in romania in France
and Spain and we want some mug shots

346
00:23:50,519 --> 00:23:54,659
from romania in that way Orson and be
fed back and basically there's about

347
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,100
twenty workshops

348
00:23:56,100 --> 00:24:00,360
they've all been tried in 45 countries
and they've been tested by lots of

349
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:04,559
people they've been in 44 Beatty
different schools they be remembered

350
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,450
about 4,000 different kids

351
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:10,649
these are proper what tried and tested
activities and workshops that you can

352
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:15,809
pick up and take and and we make these
all up in a book which you can download

353
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,950
for free from the project website and it
doesn't really read what does really

354
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:24,360
read like a book that's been written by
35 people with five different languages

355
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,260
no six no seven because this cattle out
and your body weight

356
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,649
it's not that bad is it is there was
some useful stuff in there even if the

357
00:24:31,649 --> 00:24:36,389
pros is occasionally tortured and so
that the general philosophy of the

358
00:24:36,389 --> 00:24:39,809
project and i had to put a picture of
seymour papert on this light given that

359
00:24:39,809 --> 00:24:44,850
he sadly passed away just a week and is
that we don't like learning to code

360
00:24:44,850 --> 00:24:48,209
initiatives which just gives the
co-chair and just upon skills to the

361
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:49,230
workplace

362
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:54,210
we think about this is something that's
fun and exploratory playful teaches of

363
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:58,950
facilitators not ordering the kids what
to do and coding should be playful

364
00:24:59,549 --> 00:25:02,639
particularly if you're looking at
younger kids particularly looking

365
00:25:02,639 --> 00:25:07,199
younger kids say in the last three
minutes of the talk i'm going to give

366
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:11,669
you three workshops that you could pick
up and take away briefly briefly

367
00:25:11,669 --> 00:25:15,690
describe them said android fun day I've
mentioned before this is a one-day

368
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:20,429
family workshop and use free software
that's available online called app

369
00:25:20,429 --> 00:25:24,929
inventor that comes out of MIT you can
write absolutely if you get them on your

370
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,850
phone you can

371
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:30,178
they're not you're not going to write
the next angry birds but you might write

372
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:31,940
something useful and

373
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:35,389
you might write a pong game or something

374
00:25:35,389 --> 00:25:39,830
Oh drawing package or the field these
are all these things are possible using

375
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:43,580
App Inventor and we run this with
participants I think the youngest we had

376
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,418
26

377
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:49,009
I think the oldest we had was probably
65 because we weren't as a family day so

378
00:25:49,009 --> 00:25:54,080
you get grandparents and parents and
aunt is coming in and and it is good fun

379
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,250
you go from nothing to having an app on
your phone and that kind of works as a

380
00:25:58,250 --> 00:26:05,090
real motivator for kids because the very
act of having mobile is itself a

381
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:07,309
motivator office for a lot of children

382
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:10,460
you want them to write an app that works
in a computer program the words on a

383
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,269
screen

384
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:17,809
yes all right works on Fame actually
much more enticing and this is one of

385
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,408
the workshops that come from the girona
group from the early mastery project the

386
00:26:21,409 --> 00:26:25,610
play for creating project and the idea
of this is you an animation is a big

387
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,389
group like a class animation and you
like you get together when you write a

388
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:34,789
story and then each little group and it
makes a 30-second bit with the character

389
00:26:34,789 --> 00:26:37,970
coming in on the left of the screen and
going out on the right of the screen

390
00:26:37,970 --> 00:26:41,600
your time it so that each one starts 30
seconds out of the other one and you put

391
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,590
the laptops in a row and you end up with
an animation where a character goes all

392
00:26:45,590 --> 00:26:49,070
the way across between the laptops and
it works perfectly

393
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:53,178
it's such a simple idea but you get 30
kids collaborating on something that

394
00:26:53,179 --> 00:26:59,960
runs across 15 different screens and it
really fits together and and the other

395
00:26:59,960 --> 00:27:02,509
one I want to talk about is this one
because we're probably going to run it

396
00:27:02,509 --> 00:27:04,340
as a national contest in my nose

397
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:08,629
but the idea is you take a poem and you
get the kids to basically make a a pop

398
00:27:08,629 --> 00:27:10,070
video for a poem

399
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:13,820
they write an animation where characters
move around and highlight their stories

400
00:27:13,820 --> 00:27:17,029
or any different for nursery rhymes off
of poems or something

401
00:27:17,029 --> 00:27:23,509
and so that's that say five o'clock on
the dot and this is the link to the

402
00:27:23,509 --> 00:27:27,110
resources playful coating to EU if you
want to have a look at it there's a book

403
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:31,309
to download this feedback stuff and if
you're in the UK become a stem

404
00:27:31,309 --> 00:27:34,940
ambassador the sort your DBS check and
help you going to schools and encourage

405
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,039
your daughters and your nieces and your
female relatives to have a go because it

406
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:42,350
might not be for them but they don't
have a go they won't know

407
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,350
that and that's that and no time for
questions

408
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:46,730
noted
