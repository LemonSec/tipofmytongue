00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,519
hello

2
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,029
sorry about the delay well it's like to
be a speedrun as I've gone around the

3
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:19,689
camp

4
00:00:19,689 --> 00:00:25,090
it's a it's a surprise and intrigue me
how little the image you're looking at

5
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,680
has been has been recognized so if you
don't recognize it i guess i guess this

6
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:36,940
talk will do some good housekeeping my
slideshare addresses on every pretty

7
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,149
much every slide and if you search for
it you will find it you'll probably need

8
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:45,640
to download the slides to get the links
so i'm going to skip the ante musical

9
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:47,110
disclaimer

10
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:50,500
it's nineteen sixty three and one

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:54,730
Edward Lawrence is playing with a
simplified model of convection currents

12
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:00,160
so we have three variables x y&z and the
nasty intimidating maths

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,018
perhaps at the top just says how those
quite how the rates of change of those

14
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,210
quantities depend on each other and
there are some parameters beta is the

15
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,419
one in the end that's interesting
because it describes how how how chaotic

16
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:18,670
that system is now there are no
analytical solutions by which i mean if

17
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:25,090
you wanted to have a an equation that
said how x varies with time you can't

18
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:29,319
have one you can only simulate the
system with numerical approximation

19
00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:37,810
'he's and it's the it's the apple on
Newton's head moment of dynamical

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:38,740
systems

21
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:43,719
mr. Lawrence is playing with the system
to pause it he restarts it he types in

22
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:49,509
his his in his three-year it is three
starting coordinates again slightly

23
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:55,179
truncating a couple of decimal places
and he observes that the system behaves

24
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:58,899
completely differently to the way it was
before so we have very sensitive

25
00:01:58,899 --> 00:02:01,899
dependence on initial conditions

26
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,960
let's truncate the maths as well

27
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,629
suffice it to say the means by which you
solve these equations is not all that

28
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:13,470
hard

29
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:22,590
don't use Euler's method use the fourth
order ordering the cutter so forth

30
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:27,299
ordering the cutter with solved our
rents a tractor equations we plotted

31
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:31,080
them out and we've got two initial
coordinates different very very slightly

32
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,160
and you can see that very very soon the
two traces have diverged completely and

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:46,859
are doing different things and we'll
skip my saga nostalgia as well so I want

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,440
to simplify that I want to know what
that sounds like

35
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,370
so I'm going to have three arbitrary
rules as many of the degrees of freedom

36
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,069
to good we left the last learn for the
last talked

37
00:02:56,069 --> 00:02:59,849
should actually be influencing the sound
and it should be the Celtic system

38
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:01,890
that's influencing the sound

39
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:09,238
not any arbitrary choices i might have
made and it auto sound the way it looks

40
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:16,799
so three variables to sinusoidal
oscillators because we've got two ears

41
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:24,510
the frequency of those oscillators will
be modulated by the various what by a

42
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:29,040
choice of two of the variables and those
oscillators will themselves be frequency

43
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,929
modulated by other oscillators and their
frequency will be chosen or other will

44
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:38,400
be controlled by another with the
variables and we'll have the X variable

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,190
doing stereo panning now how how did i
implement this

46
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:50,099
I did not use super collider I did not
you see sound I did not use Chuck I

47
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:55,679
definitely didn't use pure data because
they're all in music their domain

48
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,519
specific languages for musicians and if
you had gone through my other slide

49
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,430
I'm not one I want all the abstractions
of a regular regular programming

50
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:09,120
language to make my nose is with I don't
want to think in terms of various

51
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,620
musical concepts

52
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:15,690
thank you very much I'm because I must
stress because I'm utterly incapable

53
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:24,780
I did it in JavaScript i became aware of
the Web Audio API by a some BBC demos

54
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,320
re creating some of the toys from the
BBC radiophonic workshop

55
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:36,210
please examine the work of Delia
Derbyshire beyond the ruddy Doctor Who

56
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:39,210
theme june so you can draw the attractor
is scalable vector graphics

57
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:44,280
it's dead easy to specify the signal
path so left modulation oscillator

58
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:48,960
controls the less left modulation gain
which can modulate the left oscillator

59
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,680
etc etc you just declare how you want
your signal path to be put together

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:02,190
programmatically and without further ado
and i hope this guy's browser is chrome

61
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:10,820
can we have

62
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:18,560
support here please and there is it
doesn't but you know what's missing

63
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,910
to be truly evocative of the sort of the
persistence of vision of the trace what

64
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,240
we need

65
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:30,240
is some echo which are shil

66
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:35,460
there we go

67
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,489
actually that's I'm just spinning you
along them

68
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,490
everything sounds good with delay on it

69
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,489
yourself well we'll have much time I'm
going to briefly make it less chaotic

70
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,760
because we need a lot less chaos this in
this room in the moment I think we will

71
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:02,760
remember

72
00:06:05,569 --> 00:06:08,569
not as chaotic

73
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,380
to hell with all the chaos

74
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:20,460
reel reel

75
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:24,840
real raunchy retractors and roster
attracts but you can play with those psl

76
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:25,530
room

77
00:06:25,530 --> 00:06:28,030
reel reel

78
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:28,859
room

79
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:32,200
reel reel

80
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,289
I think we get the general idea

81
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:38,290
well see

82
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:05,830
but why was i picking sine waves and my
animated gifs not working

83
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:12,130
never mind what you should be able to
see is a co a buildup of a fourier

84
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,700
series where more and more harmonics are
added to the sine wave becomes

85
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,349
increasingly square

86
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:20,440
so there are lots of interesting
harmonics in your square wave

87
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:24,910
therefore if you filter them with a low
pass filter you'll get nice low pass

88
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:28,930
filter type sweeps and it'll sound cool
and you can also modulate the pulse whip

89
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:32,800
if you try and filter a sine wave while
you do people just lose the sine wave

90
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:41,140
imagine my horror when I found out that
the sword already been done

91
00:08:04,169 --> 00:08:09,359
the compose icon Tyson has translated
into several different your tail

92
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,150
tractors into sand using the software

93
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:18,150
mathematica seven winters map the
dimensions of lorenz Rossler and Cheer

94
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:21,929
attractors to frequency amplitude and
origin of the sound

95
00:08:22,590 --> 00:08:29,188
the following example is a Lorenz
attractor with x y&z dimensions map to

96
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:32,339
spatial position frequency and amplitude
respectively

97
00:08:40,198 --> 00:08:45,329
do you know I liked mine better

98
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:57,329
honestly I never wanted a modular synth
what I always wanted was a an analog

99
00:08:57,329 --> 00:09:02,939
computer if you go to evil physicist
school you get to that you can represent

100
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,880
AC circuits as differential equations

101
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,779
therefore you can represent a
differential equation with an AC circuit

102
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:18,600
that but that does then performs the the
integration of the the variables for you

103
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:28,920
and a nice man at Harvard has gone an
designed and distributed said circuit

104
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,860
and I made one

105
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:35,430
I'm not going to view you can find me
afterwards all I can tell you about the

106
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:41,670
various problems and and back how much
of a cheap op amp you can get away with

107
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:54,990
but I wanted to have my analog computer
making real analog sounds and that took

108
00:09:54,990 --> 00:10:02,760
a while so as a stopgap what I
eventually gave out a deep sigh and did

109
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,850
all right I'm just gonna I'm gonna have
Python

110
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:11,320
numerically solving the equation i'm
going to use it to drive my games midi

111
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,450
module it's gonna sound terrible

112
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:17,529
it's going to be quantized 228 values
which is sort of against the whole

113
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:21,430
spirit of the thing but we'll have the X
variable playing once in that the wine

114
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,079
said control doing a wave shaping and
filter cutoff will have the y&z

115
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:29,830
variables going to another synth with
some of the X variable controlling the

116
00:10:29,830 --> 00:10:35,890
filter and just one hand and just
because why not let's have a kick drum

117
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:41,260
triggered when the when the x-axis is
cross turn up the portamento or the

118
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:45,580
glide if you want to call it that so
those are the notes very smoothly as

119
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,950
possible and we'll hope for the best

120
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:50,950
it's gonna sound terrible

121
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:08,699
yeah

122
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:21,200
yeah

123
00:11:43,779 --> 00:11:49,749
yeah

124
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:03,360
yeah

125
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:14,060
well what do I know it got a review my
semi x housemate will who's a proper

126
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:17,689
musician whose work with damn suzuki and
zev wrote a review

127
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:26,330
I don't pretend to understand it myself
as I'm not an ethnomusicologist his

128
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:31,310
other band mate pyre of perk out there
really is a thing called Celtic medieval

129
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,209
speed folk

130
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:38,750
she's a harpist the florist and she
she's also a viciously talented painter

131
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:45,590
but she liked it so real live musicians
of which i am not one appeared to a

132
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:48,470
pizza to appear to like my silly noises

133
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:54,230
I must also mention a ver Husker who is
probably off doing a workshop somewhere

134
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:55,730
even cooler than this

135
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,620
she has a chewer circuit to where i
believe i believe it's a to a circuit

136
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,930
where the inductor in that circuit is a
big fluorescent tube and that really is

137
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,880
a sight to behold when that's going but
she also does workshops and will teach

138
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:20,689
you how to make a cool noisy things so i
was wondering how how fast is my

139
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:27,380
javascript and you begin the the blood
of browsers are quite a bit laggy and i

140
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:30,590
finally decided to become a proper
programmer and learn

141
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:37,040
lisp and what list does by virtue of
love and logical overtone is it drives

142
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:42,410
supercollider for you so i can use all
my sort of programming abstractions and

143
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:47,689
not have to think in terms of the the
sort of musical abstraction that the

144
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:50,390
supercollider uses I've got five minutes

145
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:53,510
so I'm going to play a little bit of
what that sounds like

146
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:58,460
and I'm not doing a live lisp rapel on a
Sunday morning so I recorded some of

147
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:01,460
that as well

148
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:17,310
to the rents attractors both panting so
hopefully that it is nicely evocative of

149
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:22,140
the the sensitive dependence on initial
conditions and

150
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:29,620
didn't forget the tape echo square waves

151
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:36,010
so we've got not know till the light and
sine waves back again doing exactly the

152
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:43,630
same thing as my javascript demo only
hopefully the the the the culture is

153
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:50,199
going a little bit faster in the jpm.n
in tirana brother bad and sad way

154
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:54,399
because well in fact happens is i just
generate buffers fill those with the

155
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,940
with the Lorenz data and use those as
low frequency oscillators to control the

156
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,940
the UM the final selectors

157
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,180
Oh

158
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:14,760
five minutes i reckon

159
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,949
ok i do want a modular synth fair enough

160
00:15:19,949 --> 00:15:28,170
device on the top call the nano synth
little PCB headers for patch points

161
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:31,319
which are a right pain to patch but at
least it means you can get one without

162
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:38,790
without selling a kidney that will be
that will be fed to the the various

163
00:15:38,790 --> 00:15:43,260
variables the X variable will be
subtracted from 5 volts and then fed

164
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:51,630
into my moge purchased at so the the vca
the voltage controlled amplifier will be

165
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,670
lifted up and down with the with the X
variable and its complement to simulate

166
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:01,589
planning and very much the same as as
ever we've got pulse width and frequency

167
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:05,310
modulated by on the werkstatt on the
mobis channel

168
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:14,010
we've got a frequency cutoff and the an
LFO a low frequency oscillator that's

169
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:19,470
also modulate the frequency and I built
this thing three times and I don't know

170
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,510
why they're not what why the noise is
wrong

171
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:25,769
so luckily I had the presence of mind to
record some of the record some ways out

172
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:31,470
but I've also got to some pink noise
going into the filter on the nano scent

173
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,829
which makes delightful little evocative
whooshing sounds

174
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:53,370
Julie I've got it on my

175
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:57,430
korg kaoss pedal

176
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:06,579
luckily I spoke clear so later correctly
with a with a see not a que so-called

177
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:09,609
went to me I hope

178
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:16,179
well these like these noises if not live
where at least recorded at TMF so here

179
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:19,180
we go

180
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,590
miles but the delay back in

181
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,590
very important

182
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:42,100
I would like to control the speed
properly as it is variable capacitors

183
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,370
used on the integrators ended by a
variable capacitor will be a tuning

184
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:46,149
capacitor

185
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:55,120
it will be very very very small and the
the analog computer will run way too

186
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,989
fast

187
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:00,669
so up to Scott big nasty rotary switch
their just switches between capacitors

188
00:18:00,669 --> 00:18:05,380
I'd like to have some analog switches so
I concern over at various combinations

189
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:07,600
of speeds haven't done that yet

190
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:12,760
maybe modulate the baby whatever the
digital potentiometer to ramp up and

191
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,250
down the chaos and do some sort of
routing to choose different variables at

192
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:20,260
different times

193
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:25,149
there you go

194
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:34,029
it did come from that just not today two
minutes any questions I was if that was

195
00:18:34,029 --> 00:18:34,960
working

196
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,159
if that was working i just been kneeling
twiddling knobs and scowling like it was

197
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,029
a proper power electronics ER performer
and you wouldn't get a word in edgeways

198
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:49,690
any questions I think we've got two
minutes

199
00:18:49,690 --> 00:18:49,870
what
