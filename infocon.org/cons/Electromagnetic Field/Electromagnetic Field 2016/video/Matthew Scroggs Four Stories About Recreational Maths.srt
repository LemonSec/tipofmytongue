1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,269
I'm ok I'm ready to begin

2
00:00:13,269 --> 00:00:15,790
and so hello everyone thank you for
coming to my talk

3
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:19,990
i am matthew and I'm every time you for
stories about recreational mats

4
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:23,409
this is kind of like for talks are given
a shorter events kind of crammed

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:26,560
together into one longer talk and to
keep you entertained for a full half an

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,189
hour

7
00:00:27,189 --> 00:00:31,599
I'm just let me about me and so I am a
PhD student at UCL and some of you might

8
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:35,410
be seen me last time when I was just
started my PhD are now two years in them

9
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:39,099
and i work on on numerical analysis so I
work with

10
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,110
MPD's and so if you are interested in
acoustics or electromagnetic to talk to

11
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,010
me afterwards

12
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,820
I work on this bit of software called n
plus plus was really nice we can do

13
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,900
really cool 3d simulations but in
reality i spent most of my time doing

14
00:00:52,900 --> 00:01:01,480
things like this where I oh I where I
have simulated the an electromagnetic

15
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:05,710
wave bouncing off the msf kappa logo and
because i didn't feel like working at a

16
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:07,270
time

17
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,479
anyway on to the Don to the point of
today's talk so the first storm can tell

18
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,850
you is about menace and so recently and
machine learning has been in the news an

19
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:21,640
awful lot with machines funny beating go
and I spent talking . but a lot of the

20
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,729
time you don't wanna get told how
machine learning actually works

21
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:28,750
so i'm going to explain to you one very
simple aspect of machine learning and

22
00:01:28,750 --> 00:01:33,159
tell you how to actually teach a
computer to learn something

23
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,760
I'm going to target to explain it by
playing the machine built in the

24
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:39,580
nineteen sixties and by this man Donald
Michie

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:43,570
I'm so before the sixties he worked with
ensuring at specially partner in the

26
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:48,250
wall where we were two years ago and but
after the after that in the 62 became

27
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:52,390
interested in biology and machines and
learning and he built a machine called

28
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,380
menace

29
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:58,630
so this is the photo of his machine -
and there are 300 for match boxes and

30
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:02,949
which he has meticulously drawn noughts
and crosses arrangement in each one and

31
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:07,869
start living as a carbonate one filled
each one with the tokens and i should

32
00:02:07,869 --> 00:02:12,760
say many stands for machine educable
noughts and crosses engine with an

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,310
acronym and and this is his machine
which he he designed in then it can

34
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:21,970
learn to play an awesome processes and
so how it works I'm gonna explain with

35
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:22,420
an

36
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:27,670
example game I'm so the manager is going
to play as knots and we're gonna play as

37
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:32,319
crosses and so to start off we find the
box which has this been enjoying it so

38
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,819
as I said each box has a position
drawing on it and we find the box which

39
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:38,019
has no pants on it

40
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:43,569
we shake this box we open the box and we
find a red token at the front and an

41
00:02:43,569 --> 00:02:45,369
event token is code for going here

42
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:50,019
so menaces made his move now it's my
move and I decide to go here and then

43
00:02:50,019 --> 00:02:54,340
again its menacing move so then we find
the box which has this designs on it so

44
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:58,209
it be that box and we checked that box
we open the box

45
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:01,569
I mean for the Blue taken and a blue
token is code for going here

46
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,640
now it's my turn again I go here i'm at
this point quite happy with myself I

47
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,339
seem to be doing quite well I'm its
ministers 10

48
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,840
so I find the box again with that on it
check the box open the box and a green

49
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,400
token the green token is code for going
here so it's blocked me

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:24,100
ok my me I'm now very very happy with
myself but again it's mrs. turn i find

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,970
that box

52
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:29,380
shake the box open it from the other
taken and yellows code for going there

53
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,720
and I go there and I have one

54
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:35,500
and so this this is a game which is
early on before it's done much learning

55
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:38,620
it's not very good and I just destroyed
up but here is where the learning

56
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,959
happens and this is how the machine
works

57
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:46,630
I take that token out the box which
means this was probably a bad move

58
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:49,690
because it led to losing it is now less
likely to do that

59
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:53,890
I take that taken away it's less like to
go there I take these tokens away and

60
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:58,869
it's less likely to make the mistakes I
made again and if you play about 50

61
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:00,040
games against this

62
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:04,060
it gets pretty good at drawing with you
I'm just by that simple simple mechanics

63
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:10,000
you should also am as well as losing if
you draw you add one bead and if you win

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,730
you had three beats so you're kind of
encouraging its do more things about the

65
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,790
winning discouraging it's two things
that they're losing

66
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:20,709
I'm and this am matchbox machine and she
does particularly well

67
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:24,039
so this is the graph of Donald's
tournament with it

68
00:04:24,039 --> 00:04:27,700
so we spent a whole weekend playing -
2:40 games against this thing carefully

69
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:31,690
adding and taking away tokens and with
and plotting out what happened to this

70
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:34,520
is I'm starting 0 here it is the

71
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,270
change in number of tokens he's got so
you can see it start off by losing less

72
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:42,229
games the amount tokens decreased and
then it got pretty good at learning here

73
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,878
increased and then each of these is
where he changed his strategy and so you

74
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,030
can see here he changed his strategy
which you haven't seen before so it

75
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:53,628
doesn't have to win yet but after about
20 games it picks up is worked out to be

76
00:04:53,629 --> 00:04:56,629
on a strategy and it carries on like
that

77
00:04:57,259 --> 00:05:00,710
so this is how to teach three and four
matchboxes how to play an awesome

78
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,310
crosses and if you want to play against
that you can go to this page on my

79
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:07,759
website where i built a JavaScript
version of it and to save you the time

80
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:09,500
of building on yourself

81
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,860
alternatively you could go and build
your own copy of it which is what I'll

82
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:18,500
ever just here did when i did this talk
a sec and he got his matchboxes printed

83
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:21,770
all of these which will have the
positions in them filled up mission and

84
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:23,930
laser cut brilliant box for it

85
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:27,289
I'm but if you have any ideas what to do
with them

86
00:05:27,289 --> 00:05:30,500
I'm sure he'd like to hear from you
because did you find anything to do with

87
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:37,849
them are nice so he's approximately pi
by dropping on parallel lines and

88
00:05:37,849 --> 00:05:40,460
because a large number of straight
sticks will do that for you

89
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:45,560
brilliant I'm right onto story number
two and this is about a twitter but I

90
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,199
created about two years ago called
master logic box

91
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:53,000
I'm which looks a little like this and
so it says I to a logical topologies i'm

92
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,279
currently working my way to
propositional calculus

93
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:59,330
you can read her a book here and and so
it does these brilliant really

94
00:05:59,330 --> 00:06:01,370
interesting tweets like this

95
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:04,789
I'm certainly explain to you what it
means I mean by logical topology and

96
00:06:04,789 --> 00:06:08,180
propositional calculus and what this but
is actually doing

97
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:11,539
I'm so this is a part or is it just kind
of it

98
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:18,049
processes and calculus it's a form of
and formal logic in matt's so it's a way

99
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,740
of writing sentences and then analyzing
these analyzing the system of logic

100
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,880
itself

101
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:27,020
Robin is using logic improvements and
and so you build up these centers in it

102
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:31,400
from certain symbols and these are the
symbols we are allowed to use so well as

103
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,150
variable so I'm going to lose the
letters a to Zed and then carry on with

104
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:36,770
Greek letters if I need any more

105
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:40,070
and as variable so they can be things
which is set to be either true or false

106
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:50,960
i'm going to use not so this symbol like
that means not this symbol means implies

107
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:56,299
this symbol means if known if or it was
just kinda like is equal to this is and

108
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:00,229
and this is all and I'm gonna use
brackets and these are the only symbols

109
00:07:00,229 --> 00:07:02,000
I'm allowed to use in this story

110
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,690
I'm and they're helping on the side of
the slide if you need to look up what

111
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,560
they mean

112
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
I'm and funny symbols were allowed to
cool well as build what we are called

113
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,060
formulae and these are kind of strings
of symbols that makes sense together so

114
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:17,840
obviously you can't have like three open
brackets because that is not since it

115
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,679
doesn't work so we have rules well as
performing those three rules and the

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,139
first rule is that every variables of
formula

117
00:07:24,139 --> 00:07:29,630
the second rule is that if I've got
formula then doing not that formula that

118
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:34,820
still formula and if I got to formally
then i can put any of these between them

119
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,110
and wrap them in brackets

120
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:42,590
I'm so for example is a formula because
of one and a implies a is and for me

121
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,280
because of all three because i've taken
two copies of that one and put an arrow

122
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:53,150
between them that is a formula by B is a
formula by the top one this is a formula

123
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,638
and putting together by the third will
you get that

124
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,120
and lots of other things like that for
me is you can kind of combine these

125
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,990
symbols

126
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:04,070
it doesn't really matter what they mean
but they make sense because if you read

127
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:09,080
them out as using these that you can't
like a implies a FB if and only if any

128
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,789
implies a so these are things that can
make sense and you can work out and

129
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,990
kind of the truth of the sentence I'm so
what the body is doing is it's treating

130
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:22,040
the tautologies and tautologies our
formulae that are true

131
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:29,270
whatever the values of the variables I'm
for example they are not a and because

132
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:34,728
if a is true then that says true or not
true and true or not true is like true

133
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:35,750
or false

134
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,260
and like one of true and false is true
and if it is false it says false or not

135
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:39,919
false

136
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,880
it's like false or true and so it makes
its gonna be like to be or not to be one

137
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,200
of them has to be true

138
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,900
I'm similarly a if and only if a is true
because if it is very similar to the

139
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,370
equal sign so some like well of course
is equal to a that's a tautology

140
00:08:55,370 --> 00:09:01,790
however a and B is not a tautology
because if a and B are both false then

141
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:05,750
that's obviously not going to become a
true and so that is not a tautology

142
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,860
so which is interested in the sentences
in this language that are true

143
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:16,010
whatever we do with these variables and
ok so i decided and to try and make it

144
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,130
wit about that tweets all of these that
less than a hundred forty characters

145
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,250
long and so very briefly how this works

146
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:26,030
I'm is I started by running through all
possible strings of symbols

147
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:29,720
I'm so forget about for me for now I'm
just one if you like this so i did all

148
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,110
the strings which are long how too long
what's up with all those two characters

149
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:35,600
long and so on and so on and so on

150
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,120
I know each of these and my first check
that it's actually a formula and so this

151
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,660
point i can get rid of almost everything
on the board because one into catalan

152
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:49,370
things are almost certainly not formally
so once I've got that so I'm running

153
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,850
through all the family and checking
their valid and then I try all the

154
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:56,810
different truth assignments so for the
first one with a I try if a is false

155
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:00,290
is it is it falls if a is true is it
true and if it is always true

156
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:04,790
I Twitter and you get lovely tweets like
this so this is one the tautology did

157
00:10:04,790 --> 00:10:08,660
back in April which I'm not gonna
attempt to read it now but you can

158
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,890
believe me that is always gonna be true
whatever the values of a mba and maybe

159
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:17,120
sit on a frozen work out why I'm
brilliantly for a while Twitter had this

160
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,260
an automatic translate function here

161
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:23,040
I'm so if you click on that I'm
brilliantly it realized it was in

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,630
Hungarian was what I was actually trying
to say was the arrow a and all that

163
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:31,470
garbage which was very helpful of
Twitter and they've got me to that

164
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:34,470
feature now I'm for no apparent reason

165
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,000
ok so the first 18 tautologies are these

166
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:42,210
and so there's a few I've been through
that they seem pretty reasonable the

167
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:47,310
first was like a is the same as a if a
is true the name is true either a or not

168
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:54,930
they're true or a or not they are true
and then some more and this one I began

169
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:58,380
to wonder how many tautologies that were
going to be of each length

170
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:01,980
so you see that there's two that have
five characters

171
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:05,880
there's two that have six characters and
there's quite a lot more they have seven

172
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,510
characters

173
00:11:06,510 --> 00:11:10,590
there's more i have this many characters
and I said wondering what this sequence

174
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:14,130
of the number of tautology would look
like and so I added it to the lines like

175
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:17,250
Peter Finch sequences which if you
haven't heard of it is a really really

176
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,790
great online tool and if you're ever
trying to solve some problems like i'm

177
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,650
doing a PhD it comes up a lot

178
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:25,110
you get some numbers coming out you type
in there and you can almost certainly

179
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:28,920
find out what the secret is his and loes
of links to facts about it

180
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,180
I'm so this sequence I was I said one
time to think about some properties the

181
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,780
sequence my half and and there was a few
things

182
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:42,060
I'm firstly if you've got to ecology
then notnot that totality is also a

183
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:42,930
tautology

184
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:47,310
so if something is true then notnot that
thing must also be true because it did

185
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,810
not kind of cancel each other out

186
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:53,430
which means the number of tautology of
length n plus 2 is going to be bigger

187
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,239
the number of charges let n is very just
told you back then we can make another

188
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,950
one with two knots in front

189
00:11:58,950 --> 00:12:02,610
there's got to be more of them that two
things symbols longer similarly you can

190
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:05,640
get lots of situation like this where
you've got your technology and you say

191
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,170
something doesn't matter

192
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:11,729
or this thing which we know is always
true and so you get that the number of

193
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:15,840
colleges let M plus 4 has also got to be
bigger the number of tautology just left

194
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:21,120
and I'm so it looks like as we get these
the strings longer and longer

195
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:25,170
we're going to be getting more and more
technologies and so I made the

196
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:30,209
conjecture that is gonna be increasing
so whenever we have a another character

197
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,320
we're gonna get more apologies and but
it turns out is completely not true

198
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:38,610
because the next one is six so already
it decreases and but carrying on from

199
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:50,910
there we get 57 8870 354 2086 and so on
and so it looks like maybe that sticks

200
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:53,939
is just a weird late because our numbers
are a number of symbols is quite short

201
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,430
and maybe it does increase forever

202
00:12:56,430 --> 00:13:01,380
I'm so my modified conjecture is for n
bigger than 8 i'm it's going to be

203
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:05,340
increasing but i have no idea if this is
true or not

204
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:08,850
I'm no real idea how to prove this so if
anyone has any ideas

205
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:12,959
I'd love to talk to you after about how
we might go about seeing if this is true

206
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:13,530
or not

207
00:13:13,530 --> 00:13:18,540
brilliant ok my third story

208
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,890
I'm doing great for time is about
optimal pac-man I'm so this is an idea i

209
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:26,400
had at the last year math camp when I
was in the arcade tent

210
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:30,420
I was playing pacman and I got to
wondering which way I should actually

211
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:34,260
take on background because it's not
obvious what was the best direction to

212
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:39,510
go all points and this one I got down to
sink down a few weeks after them working

213
00:13:39,510 --> 00:13:42,930
out what I should do impact man so I was
ready to come here and be better pac man

214
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:47,400
and I reminded me of some for a few
problems and the some bits of matter

215
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,310
used the first part in it reminded me
off is

216
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,469
oh I just eight pack now you all know
what patterns that slightly skipped and

217
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,470
so this is the map you go ahead and find
the root in this is the difficult

218
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:00,240
question I was thinking about

219
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,270
I don't want to move this problem the
seven ages of kids by problem this is a

220
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:07,710
problem from the seventeen hundreds
which was sold by this man I'm leonhard

221
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:13,140
euler and I'm led to the whole creation
of the field of graph theory and and

222
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,170
this is a map of königsberg which is
not wrong to do it myself

223
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,819
where you had this term with four
Islands and these seven bridges going

224
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,480
between the island

225
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,600
and the terms no Candice Bergen used to
play a really fun game

226
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:28,380
how where they'd walk around these
islands and try and cross each bridge

227
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:30,329
once exactly once

228
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:35,219
so for example you go over there and
keep going around this way and you're

229
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,269
stuck and you mr. bridge and so they
wanted to find a route to go into every

230
00:14:39,269 --> 00:14:41,850
Bridge to see lots of the town but they
don't get back on themselves because

231
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:45,690
that's really boring and i found this
really really hard to do and but kept

232
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:49,500
trying anyway I'm until literally came
along and he worked out why they've been

233
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,490
fighting so hard and because in fact it
was impossible and he explained why this

234
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,449
is impossible

235
00:14:54,449 --> 00:14:59,219
and he did this first by simplifying the
map you've got down to what he called a

236
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,720
graph

237
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:04,740
I'm like this so these are exactly the
same diagrams but here I'm just kind of

238
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:08,310
shrunken down too . i just put lines in
because we really we don't care what the

239
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:12,479
map looks like we just care how the
bridges connect the islands and this is

240
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,940
what mathematicians confusingly called a
graph

241
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:21,240
I'm not like the x and y coordinates
things we call these graphs and and then

242
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,930
he had that the real important thing he
noticed here was that

243
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:30,300
so it will look for V which goes all
these bridges once but to find that

244
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:33,120
route if you think about walking around
this island

245
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,209
I'm if I'm walking down here and all
over this island I need to leave this

246
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:39,180
island again and I need to leave the
sound again

247
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:42,599
so every time I come into one of these
items I'm going to have to leave again

248
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,510
which means it's only possible through
this route if i compare at the edges at

249
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,810
each vertex so here we're gonna have a
problem because if we come in on one and

250
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,829
go over never

251
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:56,399
we've got this one out which eventually
with we coming on here

252
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:01,079
we're stuck and so it turns out the
important thing about this problem that

253
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:05,519
he solve is that if you've got any edges
with an odd number of bridges so many

254
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:09,000
islands with an odd number bridges is
going to be impossible

255
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,329
and so this is impossible because you've
got three islands there were three

256
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:13,888
bridges there are three bridges there

257
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,940
three bridges there are five bridges
there and so every island you can get

258
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,970
stuck up so it's impossible to find one
of these roots

259
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:26,649
ok so cool we've done this with a 300
year old problem

260
00:16:26,649 --> 00:16:32,170
how about pac-man I'm so if you take
pac-man and make it into a graph and you

261
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,760
get this graph here so I've just taken
and each of the points where multiple

262
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:41,019
weeks meet such as here and here I've
made it into one of these points and

263
00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:44,680
i've replaced all of the curvy edges
with lines because i don't care about

264
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,510
distances and how its arranged

265
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:50,470
I just care about how things are
connected and each of the nodes in red

266
00:16:50,470 --> 00:16:55,180
have an odd number of edges and so we
have a lot of odd number of edges up a

267
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,160
lot look we have a lot of it

268
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,540
we have a lot of islands that have an
odd number of edges so we definitely

269
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,760
can't do this without looking back on
ourselves

270
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,319
so it's impossible to complete pack man
without looking back in yourself

271
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:12,099
I'm which is not surprising because if
any of you have played pacman you will

272
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:14,799
know it's impossible to complete pattern
of time looking back in yourself because

273
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:17,829
it's what you can't do it it's really
hard to do because it's impossible

274
00:17:18,490 --> 00:17:22,419
i'm saying i'm not actually solve the
problem yet though

275
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:26,049
I'm so i've used this thread of your own
thing and found that it's impossible

276
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:29,500
so we want to do something better now
and work out how should I be doing

277
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,429
pac-man

278
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,940
given that i've got to do some repeating
and so this is a different problem

279
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:38,620
related the vessel called the Chinese
postman problem and where the Chinese

280
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:42,159
patient problem is you've got postman
who needs to go down all the roads to

281
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:46,030
deliver letters and he wants to do that
by walking the shortest impossible

282
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,870
so it's a slight extension of the last
one like instead of just like not going

283
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:50,949
back to yourself

284
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:54,700
it's if you have to go back yourself
what's the least amount of going back in

285
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,809
yourself that you have to do and the way
you can go about solving this is that

286
00:17:58,809 --> 00:18:03,309
I'm going back in yourself is a bit like
building a copy of the bridge right next

287
00:18:03,309 --> 00:18:04,330
to the first bridge

288
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:09,370
so for example on canonsburg you could
imagine two bridges there which are

289
00:18:09,370 --> 00:18:12,370
really just repetitions of this bridge
in this bridge and now

290
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:17,860
by adding these lines everything has an
even number of edges and so I could do

291
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:21,969
every round this all I could've added
these edges here and again made

292
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,250
everything even all I could have had
those three edges there and made

293
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,470
everything even I'm and

294
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:31,490
will be interested in the shortest way
of doing this so looking at these three

295
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:36,230
options if we add up the total length of
those two bridges a dozen or three

296
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:39,470
bridges and add up the length of those
three bridges

297
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:43,309
whichever those atoms the least that's
going to be the shortest way of doing

298
00:18:43,309 --> 00:18:44,270
this path

299
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:47,389
I'm going over all the different bridges
and so we need to look at all the

300
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,669
combinations of matching up these are
the edges and for pac-man and turns out

301
00:18:52,669 --> 00:18:56,030
this is the shortest pairings for
pac-man

302
00:18:56,030 --> 00:19:00,289
I'm and with this number of edges it
took my computer all night to solve this

303
00:19:00,289 --> 00:19:04,700
because I'm as you add edges the number
of possible ways of pairing up increases

304
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:08,390
really really quickly so if pac-man the
pattern that was much bigger and this

305
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:11,750
would be almost impossible to solve
because it gets out of hand really

306
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,220
really fast but lucky for pac-man we
made to do this

307
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:21,320
and so these are the ages i want to
repeat and so I got very good at pac man

308
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:26,389
the day after work this out and there
should be some sound coming on now and

309
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:29,390
this is my attempt to attack

310
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:43,710
post is eerily quiet so I repeated that
edge then I go around here

311
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:51,649
and it appeared that edge no I haven't
gotten that once I can have a piece that

312
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,010
one edge there and I'm going at the top

313
00:19:55,580 --> 00:20:03,860
so there's that repeated and repeated
and that one

314
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:07,639
and that one

315
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:13,490
another one of Peters we need to repeat
that one down there next is there

316
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,340
and finally go back and fill in the 1i
haven't repeated over there and that is

317
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:22,340
the quickest possible ways coming man

318
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:30,669
and of course then it starts all over
again I couldn't be bothered to do it

319
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:32,649
more than once in a row so i stopped the
video there

320
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:39,039
I'm okay so my final story which is
actually more of a positive story so I

321
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,009
thought it'd be fun to send your way
with something to go and think about and

322
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:45,429
something to do and so this is a few
puzzles I've been think about recently

323
00:20:45,429 --> 00:20:49,119
that i've been working on I've got a few
ideas how to solve some of them and not

324
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:49,779
others

325
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:52,719
so this is something to keep you
entertained this evening when you get

326
00:20:52,719 --> 00:20:55,450
bored of going to all the workshops
which will never happen because there's

327
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:59,739
so much to do here and I'm so this is a
puzzle first of all taken from the

328
00:20:59,739 --> 00:21:02,589
starting points by Bagwell swords and
topped with a really good teaching but

329
00:21:02,589 --> 00:21:07,389
full of some kind of Investigatory maths
and the question in this book is you

330
00:21:07,389 --> 00:21:11,649
take a rectangle like this for by the
rectangle here and you fire a ball

331
00:21:11,649 --> 00:21:13,689
across at 45 degrees

332
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:18,549
I'm so that it goes down here carries on
bounces off the side and cows on

333
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:21,190
eventually ends up in the top right
corner

334
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:25,749
so for my through rectangle the bouncing
ball ends up at the top right corner and

335
00:21:25,749 --> 00:21:29,769
so the puzzle is for different sized
rectangles

336
00:21:29,769 --> 00:21:33,969
what corner with the liner nothin and
I'm not going to tell you I'm going to

337
00:21:33,969 --> 00:21:37,149
leave you without to go and think about
because it's really fun to work out and

338
00:21:37,149 --> 00:21:41,349
but it's not that difficult this you can
work this out in about 20 minutes you

339
00:21:41,349 --> 00:21:44,289
can get a good answer and work out what
why that would be

340
00:21:44,289 --> 00:21:48,099
and before this there's a few related
puzzle i got wondering about that was

341
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:51,009
the first thing I thought was and how
many squares of the line going through

342
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:51,669
on its way

343
00:21:51,669 --> 00:21:55,119
so in the 4-3 rectangle there's a
diagonal line going to be every single

344
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:58,718
one of the smaller squares but for
different sizes for example we've got a

345
00:21:58,719 --> 00:22:04,719
3 by 6 here and we only go through those
squares so when will the line go through

346
00:22:04,719 --> 00:22:07,029
all the squares is in the question and
this is what I haven't actually worked

347
00:22:07,029 --> 00:22:08,200
out the answer yet

348
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:11,229
and so I'm probably gonna work this out
myself this evening if I can

349
00:22:12,369 --> 00:22:17,228
and a third question is how many corners
does it go through so as the lines going

350
00:22:17,229 --> 00:22:21,190
around and on the four way through
that's not going to those corners and

351
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:23,979
but if you take a general rectangle

352
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:27,219
how could you count the number of corn
is a ghost story and we should apologize

353
00:22:27,219 --> 00:22:28,779
i have solved this one

354
00:22:28,779 --> 00:22:31,879
I was very happy with the way I work
this one out

355
00:22:31,879 --> 00:22:35,329
and when will it go through all the
comments and this is related to this is

356
00:22:35,329 --> 00:22:38,089
problem called the cross dangle ,
problem by garish copper which he

357
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,229
blogged about here

358
00:22:39,229 --> 00:22:43,309
so he was in a little math lecture I'm
gonna get bored and started doodling on

359
00:22:43,309 --> 00:22:47,059
rectangles and so he got his rectangle
and he started doing cross was going to

360
00:22:47,059 --> 00:22:50,599
die on the way so fairly similar to what
i was doing he did some crosses going

361
00:22:50,599 --> 00:22:56,958
like this and bouncing around the
rectangle like that and eventually reach

362
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:59,929
into the corner so kind of similar to
what i was doing but a little different

363
00:22:59,929 --> 00:23:03,139
and then he asked the question how many
of the squares and that with crosses

364
00:23:03,139 --> 00:23:07,758
inside them and i was very happy when I
found this on the internet because it

365
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:10,399
turns out this is exactly the same as
that rectangle here so this rectangle

366
00:23:10,399 --> 00:23:13,968
here is one square larger than that one

367
00:23:13,969 --> 00:23:17,299
but if you connect up the middle points
of that then the pattern

368
00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,899
idriel crosses is exactly the same as
the pattern i have on my rectangle out

369
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:21,408
there

370
00:23:21,409 --> 00:23:25,759
so here's problem is kind of a way of
looking at my problem upside down and so

371
00:23:25,759 --> 00:23:28,999
by having so that i may solve his
problem

372
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:33,859
and so that is three fun puzzles you can
work on this evening and let me know if

373
00:23:33,859 --> 00:23:36,948
you find some answers because it would
be good to confirm on right and find out

374
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:42,079
answers the ones i haven't yet solved
and but for now this is a clue

375
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:46,249
and so when I said I was bouncing on the
rectangle you could instead

376
00:23:46,249 --> 00:23:49,399
imagine that you've actually got mirrors
here and the ball is going straight down

377
00:23:49,399 --> 00:23:53,779
that will really help that immediately
solves two of the problems so that is a

378
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:57,169
clue for anyone who wants to go work on
this and but for now

379
00:23:57,169 --> 00:24:00,499
that is all I'm going to talk to you for
those holes are good to the bar now and

380
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,839
you can come and check me out some
questions thank you for listening
