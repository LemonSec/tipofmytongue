1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,809
hello

2
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,750
what

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,900
I'm I don't know this isn't the right
place can people hear me

4
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:23,310
yeah if i start to mumble then just wave

5
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,029
ok I'm right

6
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:31,259
my name is Tim I'm a 3d artist and
product designer

7
00:00:31,259 --> 00:00:34,949
I'm going to spend my half an hour
talking about a couple of projects that

8
00:00:34,949 --> 00:00:39,150
I've done working with so Mason at some
data

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:42,150
I managed to wrangle from NASA and doing
some kind of party

10
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:48,540
physical digital synthesis of it before
i show you what I made

11
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:51,329
I wanted to take you on a bit of a
journey and to show you some of the

12
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,149
inspirations behind the process because
that for me that's always the fun bit

13
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:58,950
and it all goes to plan you leave here
in half an hour's time feeling a

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:03,270
combination of supplying relaxation with
perhaps a little bit of creeping

15
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,100
existential dread

16
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,360
let's see how it goes but i do have to
do one thing which is a bit of shameless

17
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,850
self cross promotion

18
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,419
this is a project I've been working on
for the last two years it's a game

19
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,310
that's coming to market at the end of
the year

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:24,659
called beasts to balance it is a kind of
mix of digital and physical and there's

21
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,520
sound as it is it's kind of a co-op
board game type thing but you play it

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,899
with an ipad attached

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,369
it's going to be probably in the bar
this evening or perhaps I think there's

24
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:37,409
one of the workshops that has games
going on

25
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:40,500
so if you're intrigued about games
coming on the plate because we are

26
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,180
knee-deep in development and we would
love to get some hands-on feedback so

27
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,619
that's be some balance right so so the
project i'm going to tell you about came

28
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,759
around because of a problem that I i was
experiencing that i think is probably

29
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:03,030
going to be quite common in in the
audience and that's when you are sitting

30
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:09,360
down to try and come right concentrate
on something every so often not get

31
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,360
distracted by something that breaks you
come over

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:19,659
that was loud you have lost your focus

33
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:22,840
so that's where this problem came I have
terrible willpower

34
00:02:23,799 --> 00:02:26,890
so I wanted to see if there was
something i could find it would help me

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:32,980
to find focus and buy focus i am talking
about flow States flow States if you're

36
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:37,390
not aware of the term you will
definitely have experienced them there

37
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:41,018
is magical moments when you get so
involved in a task so absolutely

38
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:45,370
consumed by it that you're everything
else disappears away from you you become

39
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,930
a Zen master at you

40
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,239
you can see the matrix I rely on them to
do my best work but I found them

41
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,870
becoming harder and harder to reach
because of all the distractions and as I

42
00:02:55,870 --> 00:03:00,730
said a chronic lack of willpower and
it's easy to become overwhelmed

43
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:05,920
so I started to look at traditional
methods of achieving these kind of

44
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,420
states now perhaps in the past you might
turn to something like meditation or

45
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:15,339
prayer or chanting to help gain that
kind of clarity and the way these work

46
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:21,069
is they occupy the mind with very simple
repeating tasks in order to give our

47
00:03:21,069 --> 00:03:26,858
conscious brain a little time to to to
recover a little respite adult coloring

48
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,980
books which have become a really big
thing over the past few years they work

49
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,940
in the same way

50
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:36,760
very simple repetitive motions but they
weren't really going to work for me

51
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,069
because 1 i'm a horrific lead at the
atheist and - I wanted something that

52
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:46,418
would facilitate my creative process I
didn't want to have to create new things

53
00:03:46,419 --> 00:03:48,489
through coloring or something like that

54
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:53,139
so my eyes and my hands are occupied
when I work but my is they were kind of

55
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,130
up for grabs

56
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:57,130
so I started looking into music

57
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,520
try and talk a minute

58
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:08,980
so as I said before I'm not a religious
person and the wrong with a modern man

59
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:13,319
when hunting

60
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:19,340
it has a spiritual religious
connotations that I wasn't really

61
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:23,900
interested in getting caught up with now
I i don't believe that

62
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:27,380
chanting has the power to heal for
instance but i do think it can help

63
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:33,380
these are long drawn-out tones with very
little in the way of progression

64
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,830
there's very little flourish in the way
these are in the way these passages

65
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,109
music and put together and I think again
it's the same thing as things like

66
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:47,240
coloring books and and the the monkey
saw was making matters it's it's about

67
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:51,710
it's about giving the brain space to
explore

68
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:56,479
so the nice thing about these kind of
sounds is the brain can detune a little

69
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:56,930
bit

70
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,230
you're not expecting the next verse
you're not expecting the next lyric and

71
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,370
so you can start to pick apart we are
listening to him and hear the microtonal

72
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,930
that the microtones the undulations
little pitch shifted a little bit shifts

73
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:11,420
and those things really powerful

74
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:16,850
so i bought this little guy along some
of you probably have seen these before

75
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:19,070
this is called a bit machine

76
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:25,909
it's made by a Chinese French electronic
GI cool FM three and i love this this is

77
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:27,200
one of my favorite things

78
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:31,190
and the reason being from outward
appearance it's a tiny little plastic

79
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:36,680
injection molded box takes a couple of
batteries it has two switches inside it

80
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,220
is a very very low quality speaker and
an equally low-quality kind of lute

81
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,160
playing circuit board now

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:51,770
fm3 got the inspiration from these from
visiting temples specifically small

83
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:56,270
temples that didn't have the need all
the resources to have a resident monk it

84
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:58,400
would sit in the corner and chant

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,030
so what these small temples did is they
went and got a tape player they recorded

86
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:08,570
it and they had on a loop and FM three
took that concept and they made some

87
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:12,710
loops for it using their own kind of
electronic music and i'm going to

88
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,510
attempt to play it very quickly here

89
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:17,940
it's probably going to sound quite
horrible let's see if it works

90
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:20,940
yeah

91
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:33,570
so similar is trying that one similar
kind of structure is very very

92
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:36,570
microtonal there's not a great deal of
flour

93
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,370
do you have that really stood by you
have that seeing in the background when

94
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,060
I'm working

95
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:49,850
it does exactly it does exactly what i
needed to do and the nice thing about it

96
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,700
is it doesn't have any of the religious
baggage that comes with that type of

97
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,479
music

98
00:06:53,480 --> 00:07:01,610
I'm i wanted to share one more strong
inspiration with me for from for me and

99
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:05,000
this is one of my absolute favorite
contemporary artists and I could Doug

100
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,950
Foster

101
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:10,039
if you are london-based he currently has
something showing at some of the house

102
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,690
highly recommend you go and see it

103
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:19,969
he works with projection and very very
low droning music so to try and give you

104
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:23,480
an idea of the type of frame of mind not
talking about if you will indulge me I'd

105
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:29,030
like to do is just crank the volume up a
little bit and play maybe a minute of

106
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:35,809
this and why do you encourage you to sit
back and try to become absorbed into it

107
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:41,300
sink into your seats until you try until
you start to find those little little

108
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,910
changes little changes in the sound

109
00:07:43,910 --> 00:07:48,620
let your lizard brain take over for for
a minute and at the very least if you're

110
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,620
not going on with that just have an appt
spine

111
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:59,620
yeah

112
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,320
okay everyone back in the room

113
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,350
that's the kind of thing I was trying to
approach with what I'm about to show you

114
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,910
now

115
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:15,800
so another sound clip this is where the
project starts for me so I'm just going

116
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,800
to play it and then explain it later

117
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:36,760
yeah

118
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,740
yeah

119
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,810
a little whistles but before we get to
those i need to give you a little brief

120
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:50,310
astronomy lesson

121
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:55,229
ok so 1977 nasa launched the Voyager
program

122
00:09:56,250 --> 00:10:00,300
it was doing crafts or just wanted to
and they're packed to the to the gills

123
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,310
with their cameras sensors and antennas

124
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:08,520
first they went to Jupiter the slingshot
around Jupiter went off to Saturn and as

125
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:13,230
they did so they opened up their antenna
arrays and started to transmit a wealth

126
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,840
of information back to back to earth

127
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:19,740
whilst they went around Jupiter they
discovered that their active volcanoes

128
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,570
on the moon Io

129
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,550
they started to chart the cloud
formations on Jupiter and they sent back

130
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:31,229
the first ever color images of Saturn's
rings and the voyager 1 was directed

131
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,030
straight off into space and void to went
on to Neptune and Uranus and remains

132
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:43,890
still the only crafts ever to do so and
then august the 25th 2012 voyager 1 left

133
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:49,920
the heliosphere the heliosphere is the
vast magnetic a sphere created by the

134
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,270
solar winds that contains our solar
system and the boundary of the sphere

135
00:10:54,270 --> 00:10:55,740
acts as a kind of shield

136
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,310
it protects us from the cosmic rays that
are bombarded from outer space

137
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:03,270
interstellar space they're pretty
dangerous those things so avoid one

138
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:07,920
became the first man-made object ever to
leave the solar system and to give that

139
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,449
context we're talking 18 billion
kilometers from the Sun earth is under

140
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:18,120
and fifty million kilometers so it's a
it's a pretty far away and really a

141
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,120
amazing thing is it's still going
they're both still going

142
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,430
this was a captured from nasa's website
yesterday so they're a little further

143
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:31,170
away now than they were then and the
really sad thing is that in about ten

144
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:36,540
years time both of their plutonium power
sources are going to run out and then

145
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:41,160
they'll die and that sad but then their
journeys are still going to continue

146
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:46,230
because they're they're traveling at a
hundred thousand kilometers a minute I

147
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:48,300
think I may be a second comment

148
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:53,189
so eventually in 40,000 years time
avoiding one is going to reach the

149
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,370
nearest star to it

150
00:11:54,370 --> 00:12:01,960
that makes me feel very small so NASA
had no real idea of when Voyager was

151
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,010
going to leave the heliosphere they
suspected they see a change in the type

152
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:11,770
of data that was being sent back and
that's what you're listening to this is

153
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:15,850
vibrations in plasma caused by a huge
jump in the number of protons suddenly

154
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:23,260
present when Voyager left the
heliosphere this is the sound of

155
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,260
interstellar space

156
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:34,920
yeah

157
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,260
and it kind of helped me quite bag so I
wanted to see what other information was

158
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,399
out there and if you'll excuse the
disgusting segue

159
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,910
i went from listening to sounds that
came from the void - shouting out to the

160
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:48,449
void

161
00:12:48,450 --> 00:12:54,449
- it up obviously I'm and that kind of
started the journey so from that tweet

162
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:59,040
I got talking to dr. Anthony Allen at
the Imperial College London space in

163
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,040
atmospheric physics department from
there to lease a bailout of Seti and

164
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,540
bizarrely from their two best back who
is the program manager of open

165
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:14,670
innovation at NASA from one tweet and
then I ended up talking to this

166
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,479
gentleman

167
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:19,620
this is Professor bill kurth of the
radio and plasma-wave group

168
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,870
department of physics and astronomy
university of iowa and that particular

169
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:29,220
group has provided radio and plasma-wave
receivers for more than 20 NASA missions

170
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,120
including Cassini and Galileo and
voyages one and two

171
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,370
this was the guy who built the antenna
that captured the information that I was

172
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:42,630
interested in and I sent him of just
ridiculous email saying i wanted to do

173
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:51,810
some art and he was really nice and so
he directed me to a marvelous repository

174
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:57,300
of plasma and electromagnetic vibration
recordings have been captured radio

175
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:07,740
waves and then synthesized into sound so
this one here is from Jupiter Jovian

176
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,740
chorus

177
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:18,850
yeah

178
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,889
what you're listening to their is that
was generated in Jupiter's radiation

179
00:14:34,889 --> 00:14:40,319
belts and you're hearing the sound of
electrons spiraling along around these

180
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:44,310
radiation belts and sometimes they fall
out of orbit and they hit the ionosphere

181
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:50,878
like shooting stars and that creates
that whistle so you're hearing electrons

182
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,870
are going out

183
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:56,970
well going into a going into Jupiter's a
misfit

184
00:14:56,970 --> 00:15:01,439
and as I said that captured as radio
waves

185
00:15:01,439 --> 00:15:05,069
so then you can just play them through a
speaker and it comes out sound so all

186
00:15:05,069 --> 00:15:10,589
professor kurth did was clean up so get
rid of some of the low frequency noise

187
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:15,660
and slow them down by a factor of four
to make them slightly easier to listen

188
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:19,050
to you so if this was in real time it
would be kind of like birds chirping I

189
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:22,050
guess but otherwise there untouched

190
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:27,810
so I kind of knew I wanted to do
something with this to tear them apart

191
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:32,819
and see if they contained any of the
kind of times and effects that i was

192
00:15:32,819 --> 00:15:36,870
listening to I i wanted to capture so
bored on my friend dougie

193
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:42,060
he's a sound designer for games and he
took the wrong mp3's we turn I think the

194
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,529
sound on this one

195
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,920
cool so you took the war mp3's and he
started to play with them

196
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:55,990
you clean them up so they had a touch of
reverb every now and again to see if you

197
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,339
can find those long monotone

198
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,889
and

199
00:15:59,889 --> 00:16:03,819
and watch this is true that anything
that you slow down sufficiently is going

200
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:09,219
to sound epic take the infamous eight
hundred percent slower justin bieber

201
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:14,109
song you smile which is what you're
listening to now by the way the

202
00:16:14,109 --> 00:16:16,749
difference that we had we thought
anyways we're going to have things that

203
00:16:16,749 --> 00:16:19,749
sounded a bit and they actually came
from actual space

204
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:28,059
those are compromised so whilst he was a
playing with the sound i started to look

205
00:16:28,059 --> 00:16:32,079
at the physical forms i asked him to
pull off some of the waveforms that he

206
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,579
was working with to see if I could do
anything that would kind of loop it back

207
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:38,589
to where the inspiration came from

208
00:16:38,589 --> 00:16:43,449
he started to give me waveforms and I
started to extrapolate 3d forms from

209
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:47,799
them so what you're looking at here is
10 seconds of audio in each wave and

210
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:51,730
then there's ten seconds of time passing
between each wave so that there is 80

211
00:16:51,730 --> 00:16:56,859
seconds of the sound of a particular
event on Jupiter I think this one was in

212
00:16:56,859 --> 00:17:01,089
fact I remember so i'm not going to make
it up and then lofted to create these

213
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:06,730
wonderful undulating topographic kind of
alien landscapes and the nice thing is

214
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,429
that each one is different and then I
built the shape around a really cheap

215
00:17:12,429 --> 00:17:13,870
mp3 player

216
00:17:13,869 --> 00:17:17,979
the absolute bare minimum that would be
needed to hear the sounds through

217
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:22,929
headphones gave us some power buttons
and a power switch and then started to

218
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,899
3d print till there was a no tomorrow
and came out of it with these four tiny

219
00:17:28,899 --> 00:17:34,449
little personal music players each one
had a 20-minute composition on it with a

220
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:41,950
unique shape to match and we showed them
in a few galleries that purposely was

221
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:47,590
set out to allow people to sit down and
get lost in them and I think for maybe

222
00:17:47,590 --> 00:17:49,149
30 seconds of play

223
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,959
this is this one is from Saturn before i
finish off by telling you about the next

224
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:56,080
thing i've done so let's crank it up
again

225
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,929
thank you

226
00:17:56,930 --> 00:18:03,110
yeah

227
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:36,090
yeah

228
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:41,480
ok so i think

229
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,510
yeah that the sound system isn't quite
right for that but I promise you there's

230
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:49,070
more going on than just base then I
think the next one is is going to make

231
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:51,320
more sense oh you are one one final
thing

232
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,189
seven minutes left this is the curiosity
landing site on mars specifically it's

233
00:18:58,190 --> 00:18:59,510
called the gale crater

234
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:05,150
it's 200 kilometer 200 kilometers across
and that central point is 33 miles high

235
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:13,459
this is a 3d model that was captured by
NASA and has put online they have a

236
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:19,490
fantastic open resource of data and
specifically a 3d models that they put

237
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:24,350
out of all the satellites as well as
some topological information like this

238
00:19:24,350 --> 00:19:26,330
you can download it do whatever you want
with it

239
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:32,210
so looking at this I was definitely
getting a kind of hand solo 2001 vibe so

240
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:36,919
I thought let's make a massive modeling
days of constant

241
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:53,820
yes 30 days of cutting time gave us a to
meet at all panel which which kind of

242
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:58,110
looks more like a warhammer table than
anything else but you know the good

243
00:19:58,110 --> 00:20:00,178
thing about it is painted black and it
becomes art

244
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:04,679
yeah so that was it

245
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:09,090
standing in our workshop looking quite
dramatic

246
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:13,799
and then we worked in Reverse with the
sound this time so I took that a 3d form

247
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:19,830
and cut it into two hundred sections 200
wave forms which I I i did manually

248
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:23,820
because I'm not a coda so there's any a
software people i'm sorry for the

249
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:31,830
inefficiency there and then I'm
unbelievably we were asked by the i was

250
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:35,309
asked by the taper into to put it in
there so they gave us a little room

251
00:20:36,390 --> 00:20:39,630
this is the only picture i could get out
of it and it sat in the corner a little

252
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:45,270
bit dramatic lighting and that
horizontal line that moved in time with

253
00:20:45,270 --> 00:20:48,539
the music so when you look at it
Bleakley you could see the waveform as

254
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:54,929
it moved so let's I've got a little bit
of the audio from this one that saved us

255
00:20:54,929 --> 00:20:57,929
a little more successful and then that
will be done

256
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:05,029
yeah

257
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,060
okay thank you very much
