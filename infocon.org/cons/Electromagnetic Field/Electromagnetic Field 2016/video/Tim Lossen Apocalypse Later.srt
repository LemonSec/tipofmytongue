1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,800
I

2
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:12,940
but for now

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:15,530
leave you with tim was going to

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,530
about the upcoming of apocalypse

5
00:00:21,349 --> 00:00:29,509
so thanks for coming to the so now let's
get started

6
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,640
so imagine imagine this scene

7
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:42,620
it's the year twenty twenty-five you
open the wooden box and take the relic

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:50,480
out carefully hold it in your hands and
then you try to press the button and

9
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,319
flickers briefly but at any cost dark
again and the last iphone on earth has

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,949
died

11
00:00:57,949 --> 00:01:02,748
forever so that's sort of like the mood

12
00:01:02,749 --> 00:01:11,240
like I want to set for this talk and
there's three main points I want to make

13
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,009
effective

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,360
yeah

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,560
ok let's just do it like this there's
the three main points I want to make so

16
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:30,469
a our current civilization that we take
it for granted is much much more fragile

17
00:01:30,469 --> 00:01:31,850
than it seems

18
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:37,520
the second point is if we think about
survival

19
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,429
we have have to think about long-term
survival not immediate survival and the

20
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:49,520
third point i want to make is well the
best time to start preparing and to

21
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,820
start experimenting is of course right
now

22
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:59,359
ok so first let's look at fragility

23
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:03,380
so there's a lot of things that could go
wrong right

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:07,460
maybe you say yeah but will it really
have that big of an impact

25
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:14,690
well I can give you a few examples what
could potentially happen it could be

26
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:20,090
something external it could for example
be something like a large asteroid

27
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,019
strike or large meat red strike right we
have craters

28
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:25,920
we have found craters

29
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,720
in the earth and the crust of the earth
and if something on this scale what

30
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,480
happened again then I'll ok it's obvious
that nothing can survive in the

31
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:41,220
immediate impact zone right so you're
saying okay maybe if it happens in

32
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,200
Australia it's not so bad over here

33
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,660
well it will be because basically
basically what happens is a lot of when

34
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,660
the impact happens a lot of um a lot of
stuff is stepped up into the atmosphere

35
00:02:54,660 --> 00:03:00,150
and the whole earth will go dark and in
a very short time and when the earth

36
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,360
goes dark when the sunlight is blocked
all the plants will die

37
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,450
all the animals will die and we will
also die

38
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:11,100
so that's one possible scenario it could
also be something that is not external

39
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:14,880
but it could be something that because
ourselves right it's like nuclear war is

40
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,350
always an option

41
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:23,160
maybe even becoming more of an option at
the end of this year we don't know right

42
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:29,250
but it really is like 3,000 news on the
earth right now I think I'm and just not

43
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:33,120
even we don't even need 3,000 right just
a couple of them let's say like to add

44
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,970
10 20 would have the same effect

45
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:39,930
there's total any relation with a strike
but then in the aftermath

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,510
there's darkness and widespread chaos

47
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:50,160
well then there's other options if
you're still not convinced right that I

48
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,540
have other options for you

49
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,900
I could offer a deadly virus that breaks
out

50
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,230
this is also something that could
actually it could just be happening

51
00:03:58,230 --> 00:03:59,940
right now we don't know right

52
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,820
just a virus that mutates in a way that
it has a long incubation period about is

53
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,910
at the same time quite badly are quite
dangerous

54
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:14,100
then it would immediately spread I mean
we have this is the nice thing like we

55
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,390
have everything is connected

56
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:18,570
normally it's a good thing but in this
case it's a very bad thing because it

57
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,849
would mean the virus would basically
reach everybody on the whole of except

58
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:27,090
maybe some disconnected tribes in the
Amazon or something right

59
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:36,200
so um why does this White why do I say
that civilization is more fragile than

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,280
it seems

61
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:41,330
well okay so that these things that
could potentially happen but then the

62
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:47,539
other thing we have to take into account
this that we are very much at the set

63
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:50,060
everything is interconnected for an hour
right

64
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,400
if you look at the immediate medieval a
medieval town medieval village

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,609
it is maybe not a hundred percent
self-sufficient but it is pretty

66
00:04:58,610 --> 00:04:59,930
self-sufficient

67
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,740
whereas on the other hand we are
anything but right we need for example

68
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,870
to make the iphone right it

69
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:09,830
this is like it's if you really look at
all the thing that goes into an iphone

70
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,889
with all the raw materials that have to
be fetched from Africa

71
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:18,650
I'm smelted somewhere and transported
again turned into parts turn into

72
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,159
something assemblies turned into the
final assembly and it's it's it's

73
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,210
mind-boggling right

74
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:28,430
this is the whole earth is collaborating
to make just this one this one is one

75
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:31,100
magical object and I can hold it in my
hand

76
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,400
finally but this is not just for the
iphone right the same is also true for

77
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:41,810
at most kinds of foods most kinds of
machines that we use and so the problem

78
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:46,250
and that is if let's say I'm from
Germany right

79
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:50,780
I what I would i would say in the whole
of Germany 80 million people there is

80
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:54,830
there's not a hundred people that could
make an axe from scratch

81
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:59,180
probably maybe there's more but I don't
know right but we can make what we can

82
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:05,450
make is like specialized motors for cars
specialized parts for rockets everything

83
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,060
right but we can't do that

84
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:13,340
well we have a we want to have to do
that but be this is not like this is

85
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:13,729
this

86
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:16,729
we can only do because the parts are
coming from China the parts are coming

87
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:19,190
are being assembled and Vietnam
everything right

88
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:24,020
so everything is connected so even even
if it's not the total global catastrophe

89
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:29,599
even if it's just say a local
catastrophe local that takes out most of

90
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,449
Asia

91
00:06:30,449 --> 00:06:35,279
we are still we still have a problem
with severe problem

92
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:43,199
ok so this is sam this is part number
one that why i think the civilization is

93
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,259
quite quite more fragile than it seems

94
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:52,229
second part if we are if we were serious
about survival

95
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:58,050
in such a case what we have to to do
what we have to look at and then there's

96
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:04,080
like that these people called Preppers
they they always get very excited when

97
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,949
the world is about to end like and year
two thousand right and then they come

98
00:07:07,949 --> 00:07:10,949
out and make preparations day they go to
walmart and buy

99
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:20,460
I don't know 1,000 cans of beans right
and 22 tons of flour right and this is

100
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,149
all nice and good and it would actually
probably help in the first year but

101
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:27,060
after that when all the beans are eaten
right

102
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:30,479
what do you do then right so this is
short-term survival

103
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,378
this is and this is not so interesting
to me this is also very it's more like

104
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,289
you're concerned with yourself right - I
want to survive

105
00:07:37,289 --> 00:07:43,860
whereas I think I am well at each other
in another talk he put it like this the

106
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:44,849
humanity

107
00:07:44,849 --> 00:07:51,149
currently it's like the nervous system
of the planet and so we should not think

108
00:07:51,149 --> 00:07:55,709
about how can I survive but how can we
how can we make sure that this nervous

109
00:07:55,709 --> 00:08:02,399
system and in some in some form or other
can survive right so that's that's what

110
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:07,949
I mean with long-term thinking in
survival the short term of course and

111
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,849
first some some people have to survive
short term of course otherwise we can do

112
00:08:11,849 --> 00:08:15,599
it but I'm more interested in what would
we have to do if we expect to do this

113
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,610
long term and I think we need three
kinds of things to make this work

114
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,200
long-term

115
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:28,260
the first one is seats the second one is
tools and the third one is knowledge so

116
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:31,740
seeds is pretty obvious because this is
something we cannot manufacture right

117
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,970
seeds

118
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:36,270
either we have them and we don't have
any done then we're fucked

119
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,150
but I he is saying okay so i will just
go to the next field and take some weed

120
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:44,400
and there are my seats right now I'm
done

121
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:49,079
why do we have to prepare for that well
the problem is the kind of wheat that's

122
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:53,700
growing in the fields this is not the
kind of seeds you want this hybrid seat

123
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:00,569
this will if you see it and grow at the
next year it will produce very different

124
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:06,030
plants from what you're seeing right now
in the field and it would take a several

125
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,230
like it will take like 10 years to grow
this into it even if you know how to do

126
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:14,940
it it would then take a longer time to
grow this into a viable seat again

127
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:22,170
so what we actually want is the kind of
like what's called heirloom seeds seeds

128
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:29,790
that are still in the original form and
not bred into a hybrid form and well

129
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,530
there is happily there is a large store
of these seats

130
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:40,050
it's the solid but small bird seed my
seat sucks well bird seed vault

131
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,969
if you have heard about it mmm it is in
small Bart

132
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:50,220
there is a man island and in its better
be in the middle between Iceland and

133
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,690
enter the North Pole sow the seeds are
very well protected there

134
00:09:54,690 --> 00:09:59,460
that's good the good thing the bad thing
is we would have to go there and fetch

135
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,320
them if you want to use them right

136
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,600
so it's not really i mean this is of
course it is also meant as a backup as a

137
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,820
plan B but it meant right now it is
mainly a backup for seed banks that put

138
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:16,200
their stuff they're practically put a
backup copy there at to fetch it again

139
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,440
if their local collected them the
working copy is destroyed

140
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:24,660
but we could use it but even better we
should have em distributed seats seed

141
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:32,640
banks basically everywhere to maximize
the chance that wherever like whoever

142
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,580
people are able to survive then they
have seats readily available and that

143
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,170
yeah that is that is the first thing
seat

144
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:52,890
tools tools are in a way also something
like seats right because tools are what

145
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:54,850
allow us to make new things

146
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:58,959
so a an anvil and Hammer

147
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:07,000
this is quite a small thing still allows
me potentially to make hundreds and

148
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,160
thousands of other tools that i can use
them to bootstrap other parts of society

149
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,199
there so needing tools right

150
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:18,310
so I think it's more viable to
concentrate on the tools that are that

151
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:24,130
are compact tools that tools for making
other tools and then let's say we have

152
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,319
seeds we have tools now the most
important parts still missing is is know

153
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:31,509
how its knowledge is

154
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:38,410
I mean me with a hammer and anvil I
could start poking around and trying to

155
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:42,219
figure it out but it would be much
better if I had already done the

156
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:45,850
workshop that's happening this evening
for example right and then I had some

157
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:51,160
like a head start on on doing something
useful and the same is true for

158
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,829
everything else there's like the same is
true for agriculture

159
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:00,490
like if you have never had a garden and
you just read about it sounds or

160
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:04,720
everything sounds very nice and easy but
they have when you try it it's not that

161
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:12,670
easy as unforeseen complications and so
my feeling is it's better to work out

162
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:17,319
all the king's like right now then later
when we don't have the time right maybe

163
00:12:17,319 --> 00:12:21,430
you just have this one harvest and it
has to work either

164
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:24,420
it works all your debt

165
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,990
so I in this case i would rather prefer
to have it done already a few times

166
00:12:27,990 --> 00:12:29,070
before hand right

167
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:37,410
so in the third part i was good i wanted
to show a few examples of of things that

168
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:42,689
me and others have been trying
experimenting with and I call this

169
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,029
approach seat banking

170
00:12:45,029 --> 00:12:48,630
so like I said we need seats

171
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:54,360
tools are also seeds in a way knowledge
is also a seat is that doesn't have to

172
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:58,199
be complete we can generate new
knowledge but we need to starting point

173
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:05,189
so together we need these seeds and we
have to start them in a way that they

174
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:08,579
are readily available in a distributed
fashion

175
00:13:09,329 --> 00:13:13,979
so what I've been doing personally and
I've been working on

176
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,600
I haven't actually build it but i have
constructed a seat bank was just like a

177
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,769
readily as the stress of sandbox
literally just a sandbox

178
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,160
because it doesn't have to be
refrigerated right if you make it deep

179
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,860
enough let's say half a meter and put
the glasses the jars with seeds are on

180
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,269
the bottom then I think and maybe even
cover the whole thing with boards or

181
00:13:36,269 --> 00:13:37,050
something

182
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:41,430
i will think this will hopefully this
will stay like a quite a uniform

183
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:45,390
temperature all over the year it would
be best if it was refrigerated like it

184
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:52,230
lets it would be best if Germany had
permafrost soils but it doesn't yet so

185
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:55,410
that's that's one thing i'm working on
then i'm working on growing potatoes

186
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:00,209
very and it sounds banal but it is
actually a cassette you read about it

187
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:03,420
it sounds simple you do it then oh and
uh huh

188
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,640
ok I didn't foresee that so I'm i will
i'm looking forward to harvest my first

189
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,170
crop this this fall

190
00:14:10,170 --> 00:14:15,209
let's see you the only potato I've taken
out of the grounds of forest like this

191
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:19,070
yeah but the growing season isn't isn't
over yet right

192
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:22,250
what else

193
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,000
oh yeah there's this I was going to show
you a few screenshots status

194
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:34,670
there's a guy in Australia and he has a
youtube channel and it's called

195
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:41,569
primitive technology google it is then
watch it there because it's awesome and

196
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:43,550
so he's like he has this hobby

197
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:48,170
there's less of a is just like it I
think it's fun it's fun to go into the

198
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:56,689
woods with empty hands and start making
things so there's one video ways better

199
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,260
he is literally starting with empty
hands and he's making a house with a

200
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,370
tiled roof

201
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:07,130
ok so what does it do right it goes and
goes and grabs a stick and a suitable

202
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:12,200
stone and makes a stone axe and he
starts falling trees with a stone axe

203
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:19,730
then he's the erecting the the beams for
the house and I don't know with peace

204
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:24,350
just choosing stuff right that he finds
there and then he's making the tiles for

205
00:15:24,350 --> 00:15:31,520
clay he built a little open to fire
tiles puts the tiles on the roof and

206
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,780
that in this video

207
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:37,010
basically it's like it's like he shows
everything but of course it's like the

208
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:41,210
videos 15 minutes it probably took him
like i would say a month of also to do

209
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,880
the whole thing right it's just a hobby
he has a full-time drop

210
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,010
he lives in a normal house it just does
this for fun and he has like tons of

211
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:52,310
other stuff and actually encourage you
to check that out

212
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,840
mmm

213
00:15:53,840 --> 00:16:03,170
I can't remember ever to other examples
i was going to to bring up

214
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,270
oh yes oh yes in Germany we have a
children's to like now

215
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,420
once you have this mindset right once
you have this mindset and then end and

216
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,640
watching out for stuff that could be
useful

217
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,900
you see it everywhere like this and
German children's television there's a

218
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:24,410
very famous program called send on
Mickey Mouse

219
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:30,500
I'm and have like comic stuff and
they're always they have one topic each

220
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:36,950
each week but i'll show how something is
made so they go to factories

221
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:40,760
they've show how the biscuit is made or
whatever and then they had this like a

222
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:48,920
few weeks if you expect that had how our
ancestors made iron and just totally

223
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,930
blew my mind this is so awesome

224
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,469
like I learned that there is a form of
iron or did it just be that you can just

225
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:56,060
pick up from the field

226
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:02,089
it's called bak iron ore and it's
created by bacteria that my mind was

227
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:04,250
already blown at this point right I was
a heck

228
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:07,459
okay IRA or is something you find in the
in a deep in the mountain

229
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,940
no I just like it says she'll actually
there's like a plow going over the field

230
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,709
and then you can pick up some of like Oh
stolen CIA just the iron ore ok and then

231
00:17:15,709 --> 00:17:16,490
they go

232
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:23,720
I'm and just on the lawn they make a
very primitive open to to smelt the iron

233
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,360
ore to put in the order to put in
charcoal to put in and this is so simple

234
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:29,870
right

235
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:33,350
but it is like it looks very simple in
the video maybe the practice a few times

236
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,699
I don't know

237
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,090
and this but it's also a lot of work
like this

238
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:44,750
the D open the kiln that the build was
like I think it was like two meters high

239
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:49,790
or two and a half meters from clay just
took several days and they had fire it

240
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:54,590
for I don't know a day or two and the
end they push it actually push it over

241
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,689
to get at the iron medicine on the
bottom and then they have to still have

242
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:02,029
to work out all the second

243
00:18:02,029 --> 00:18:07,340
that as many of the impurities that I
can and in the end they have like I

244
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:11,029
don't know like maybe the size of the
iphone right that is the amount of iron

245
00:18:11,029 --> 00:18:12,499
that produced in a week

246
00:18:12,499 --> 00:18:18,859
so but still right still it's kind of
useful to know how to do it and I would

247
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:22,399
have to worry about would have liked I
was so envious that I was not there when

248
00:18:22,399 --> 00:18:25,908
they did it right i would have left to
just be there and and watch instead of

249
00:18:25,909 --> 00:18:28,940
having this video but the video is so
cool

250
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:33,259
so to sum it up

251
00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:39,499
I'm i think civilization is more fragile
than we normally think

252
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:48,409
and so if we if we reflect on this fact
and think about it ended is even if i'm

253
00:18:48,409 --> 00:18:51,499
not saying that something bad is
happening next year or the next ten

254
00:18:51,499 --> 00:18:55,249
years and I'm not going to predict the
future right but just because there is I

255
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:58,249
think a nonzero possibility of something
like this happening

256
00:18:58,849 --> 00:19:06,649
it's quite rational to reduce to do some
kind of preparation for this case and if

257
00:19:06,649 --> 00:19:09,738
we think about it then the only black

258
00:19:09,739 --> 00:19:16,190
I'm arguing the best thing we can do is
long-term preparation we can we can try

259
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:22,549
to make sure that seeds seeds are all
seats are basically distributed all over

260
00:19:22,549 --> 00:19:28,279
the earth and in the app that's it is
just like maybe just Nicaragua's for

261
00:19:28,279 --> 00:19:32,539
Nicaragua survives nothing else survives
right but even then they should have

262
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,969
seeds that they can use right

263
00:19:34,969 --> 00:19:38,659
maybe that they would have something
anyway they would have something like

264
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:41,929
random stuff but I want it to be a
little bit more focused

265
00:19:45,149 --> 00:19:53,609
yeah and well the final my final thought
is if you think yeah this is I don't buy

266
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:58,649
it right i don't buy the whole story
then still it's a nice framework it's a

267
00:19:58,649 --> 00:19:59,488
nice

268
00:19:59,489 --> 00:20:03,659
it's it's it's just a lot of fun playing
around with stuff right and this is what

269
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:08,129
i see when people are doing this all
over the place without this framework

270
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:12,629
so why not why not just have this in the
back of your mind while you tinker with

271
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:18,449
stuff and i set up a google group if
anyone is interested it's empty but it

272
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,119
has the slides so there's an incentive

273
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:26,189
you can you can go there and then you
can check out the slides and see what I

274
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:35,460
forgot to tell and it's tinyurl.com /c
banking

275
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:41,620
thank you

276
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:42,600
yeah

277
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,559
thank you I very impressive to do that
without slides or anything you wish to

278
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,590
have four minutes for questions if you
want to take questions

279
00:20:52,590 --> 00:20:57,629
sure sure if you want to ask questions
please raise your hand and I will bring

280
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:00,630
the mic to you

281
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,059
hi you saying I'm that there were three
stages do you have to plan the seeding

282
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,789
the tools and the knowledge but what
about material with that come under the

283
00:21:14,789 --> 00:21:19,230
knowledge of say you were saying
blacksmithing would you say the

284
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:23,970
knowledge of learning what steals you
could use in a apocalypse situation

285
00:21:23,970 --> 00:21:28,770
would that be classed as knowledge or
would you put that in store like the

286
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:34,620
seed banking you stockpile a small
amount of material to steal for tools in

287
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,760
a future date

288
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,940
yes so for the knowledge I think it

289
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:46,260
ideally I envisioned something like
recipes a collection of recipes and I

290
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:50,010
mean we we should not assume that the
earth is in a state of two thousand

291
00:21:50,010 --> 00:21:54,240
years ago we should assume the other the
current state so if I maybe i would not

292
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:58,200
start with black iron all right maybe I
would start with how do i melted them

293
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,130
post

294
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:02,940
what's the best way to to melt down the
lamp post because it will be given me a

295
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:07,140
lot of fire and quickly vs much more
slowly

296
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:10,830
right so stuff like that

297
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:15,299
practical so I have a question

298
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:20,010
I'm interested in what do you think that
the pros and cons of decentralized and

299
00:22:20,010 --> 00:22:22,230
centralized prepping strategies

300
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:26,250
well as there's so much uncertainty what
can happen

301
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:30,330
I would argue it's pretty clear that
decentralized this is much superior

302
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:35,850
right because the latest father's seat -
see told it's it's it's it's awesome it

303
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:40,080
has 1.2 million different kinds of seat

304
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,600
but if it's taken out then it's gone
right so uh huh

305
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:48,299
this is sort of like they're at that is
always did the point against a

306
00:22:48,299 --> 00:22:50,879
centralized approach

307
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,440
higher higher I'm just got a quite an
optimistic talk

308
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:59,070
I think the negatives talked about by
whole load of food and a crossbow

309
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,909
we wish to protect it and you look a lot
of that Apocalypse TV programs are

310
00:23:02,910 --> 00:23:06,990
walking down the threat of them comes
from other people using there is a any

311
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:10,710
kind of value in preparing to defend
yourself against other people who are

312
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:17,010
coming for your seeds and blacksmithing
equipment so yes certainly i mean at I

313
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,158
think there's more more missing right
this is more like the technology side

314
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,820
then the whole pot like to hold
organizational side

315
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:27,809
this is also something i was thinking
about if just like what's even needed to

316
00:23:27,809 --> 00:23:30,120
make a camp like this work right

317
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,189
you need yeah you did just it this is
not the stairs honor and it's not

318
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:41,159
spontaneous right there's this plan to
order in the camp and you would even we

319
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:45,000
don't need something like that in on an
even bigger scale of course to organize

320
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,480
the survivors and deal with ya

321
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,230
also deal with people who are playing
two other rules right yes

322
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:56,340
one last question No

323
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:05,549
hi have you thought about like keep
storing bacterial colonies for making

324
00:24:05,549 --> 00:24:07,260
medicines or anything like that

325
00:24:07,260 --> 00:24:13,289
like so Oh will be a yes but yeah that
kind of seating

326
00:24:13,289 --> 00:24:17,309
well now that's that's that's a very
good point and no i haven't

327
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,570
that's a bit more tricky everything
that's living as much like i would also

328
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:26,220
like to to ensure that we have goats
around cows but how do we do that today

329
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,960
we can to freeze-dry a cult

330
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,960
we could we could

331
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:35,680
yeah I know I'm if you have good ideas
then

332
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:38,680
yeah let's talk

333
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:44,439
so we are out of time uh thank you I if
you have more questions I suppose you

334
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,910
might be available

335
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,820
oh yeah ah yes thank you
