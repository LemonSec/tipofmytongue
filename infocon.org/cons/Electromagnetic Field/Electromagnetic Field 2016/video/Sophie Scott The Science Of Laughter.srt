1
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:16,250
oh hello again everyone so our next next

2
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:22,009
in here DMX 2016 on stage a is so he's
got the right

3
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:31,250
yes kept talking about science of
laughter so we know if / - right

4
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:36,019
thank you very much thank you so I'm
gonna talk to yourself doing about the

5
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:40,670
science of laughter and I'd like to try
and stop like well initially convincing

6
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:43,670
you that there is such a thing as a
science of laughter and if you go on to

7
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,410
any of the mainline databases for
looking at published papers and put it

8
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,919
in the terms emotion expression of fear
if you go to PubMed for example put in

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,300
those terms you'll get back well over a
thousand papers and if you just replace

10
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:00,110
the word fear with laughter emotion
expression laughter you get back 45

11
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,839
papers and about four of those by me

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,420
so it's not like there's an enormous
field of research but i'm going to try

13
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,759
to convince you that it is worth looking
at

14
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:11,180
the other thing that I just want to
establish at the start is how deeply

15
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:16,130
weird laughter is a really peculiar
behavior gonna play some recordings of

16
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:20,179
real human beings laughing and I want
you just to think about like as a

17
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:23,780
primate sound imagine I was a an
explorer coming back from the rain

18
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:27,439
forest and saying I found this new type
of paper and this is the vocalization it

19
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,529
produces you wouldn't be surprised if it
was something like this

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,560
it's a loser I don't mail laughter
sounds kind of recognized little if you

21
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:45,259
get bit 5250 I think things get a little
stranger now

22
00:01:45,259 --> 00:01:59,060
dude in the ER here are you know your
your your your your your your your your

23
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:05,659
your er yeah that this guy i find a bit
distressing because I need him I badly

24
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,310
need them to take a breath

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:10,310
it sounds like he's going to pass out
good

26
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:32,880
any bread is it turns out most people
laughing breathing out haha so it's just

27
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:33,750
exhalation

28
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,900
he's also breathing in free by breathing
in were laughing so it's going huh

29
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,670
as well so it sounds like he's going to
die but in fact is ok as getting into

30
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:42,780
and i'll come back to that

31
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
and finally this is a human female

32
00:02:48,360 --> 00:03:03,060
maybe I want you think with a good

33
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,420
so it's it's it's a very peculiar sound
and sometimes i think when we laughing

34
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,040
really helplessly genuine involuntary
way it can take you into places where

35
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,120
you make sounds you would never make it
to voluntarily all things being equal I

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:22,290
bet that woman was prepared prefer that
she hadn't started going to be a hard

37
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,609
time on a recording of some kind and
want to pop part of that is because it's

38
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,640
an involuntary vocalization part of it
because some of the weird stuff that

39
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,670
happens when we laugh and to think about
what laughter is you need to think about

40
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,780
the parts of the body that people who
work in your sciences don't normally pay

41
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,110
much attention to you going to think
about the ribcage generally in

42
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:43,740
psychology neuroscience as we concern
ourselves with the head and the stuff is

43
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,130
inside the head and then if you're
really Freudian you might go straight

44
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:50,220
down to the pants and the stuff around
their breasts most the rest of the body

45
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,370
we don't pay much attention to but
actually the ribcage is amazing

46
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:57,240
and what you're doing at the moment is
using your ribcage the ribs

47
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:01,380
the muscles between the ribs and the
diaphragm along the bottom to stay alive

48
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:05,400
so what you're doing is you're getting
air in and out of your lungs using your

49
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,060
ribcage to use the intercostal muscles
the muscles between your ribs to pull

50
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,800
the ribcage out and up that creates
negative pressure and draws air into the

51
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,168
lungs you relax them back down and that
squeeze the air out so you just get this

52
00:04:19,168 --> 00:04:20,639
is a cycle motion

53
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,120
you did it from the minute you were born
whole rest of your life don't stop okay

54
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,319
you're doing it right now

55
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:29,789
now that gives you those to measure they
spoke at your movement of your ribs just

56
00:04:29,789 --> 00:04:32,400
you're just by putting a breath belt
around the apps around the outside of

57
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,359
your chest

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,039
you get this sort of smooth sinusoidal
movement as soon as we start talking

59
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:41,818
we use these same muscles the
intercostal muscles and the diaphragm

60
00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:47,819
completely differently and what we do is
we take a breath in and then we use the

61
00:04:47,819 --> 00:04:52,860
same intercostal muscles to maintain is
a constant flow of air this particular

62
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,729
pressure at the larynx the voice box and
if I can't talk without take another

63
00:04:56,729 --> 00:04:59,878
breath you'll start to hear but I lose
my voice because my intercostal muscles

64
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:03,270
of the arm around a lot we're really
really hard squeeze the air app and one

65
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:08,580
of these days in doing that I'm either
going to pass out or urinate and I think

66
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:10,139
we're okay Anna

67
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:15,300
so you're probably thinking well that
was interesting Sophie and a bit weird

68
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,900
almost essentially that's the only
reason we can talk at all is because we

69
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,888
can do this we can only do this a talk
as we walk upright in our evolution

70
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,169
we've gone up into our back legs all
sorry

71
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,520
all other mammals all other quadrupeds
have to use their fallen to support

72
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:33,900
their weight and this means they're
using their intercostal muscles to

73
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,138
maintain to help support the structure

74
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:40,439
what's happened in our evolution is
we've got up onto about lakes we have a

75
00:05:40,439 --> 00:05:44,789
long with very different muscular
control of our or a facial region that

76
00:05:44,789 --> 00:05:48,628
are completely different muscular
control over the ribcage and these

77
00:05:48,629 --> 00:05:51,000
muscles and the diaphragm in between the
ribs

78
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,659
this means that we are the only animal
that can do this with the only animal

79
00:05:54,659 --> 00:05:58,740
can breathe this way and that means
where is one of the main reasons why we

80
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,990
are one of the only animals that talk

81
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,800
this is giving us continuous speech we
don't have to say words

82
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,590
on each exhalation so you've got this
kind of long continuous Spanish species

83
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:17,008
putting all the rhythm and the music
into speeches it's an amazing thing

84
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:21,419
we tend not to pay attention to it and
it has a complete enemy when you start

85
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:25,740
laughing you start to get a very
different paths when you start laughing

86
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,949
these same muscles the muscles between
your reputation your diaphragm started a

87
00:06:28,949 --> 00:06:30,690
huge contractions

88
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,979
this is me laughing you guys very very
rapid deflections it's just squeezing

89
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,609
air out of you and we don't really
understand why but when you start

90
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:43,469
laughing involuntarily it will stop you
from talking and it will stop you from

91
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,560
breathing and for most people it's just
squeezing air after you and it is trying

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,310
to kill you

93
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:52,229
it's quite dangerous but a stressful
thing after so just look at this from a

94
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:53,490
different perspective

95
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,330
this is running an MRI machine like a
video camera to show what happens when

96
00:06:57,330 --> 00:07:00,750
somebody's talking this is a colleague
of mine speaking and you can see how

97
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:05,129
these amazingly five movements that
she's making with her tongue and her

98
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:09,509
lips and a soft palate and all of us are
able to this amazingly precise movement

99
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:13,139
and that's what gives us human speech
with the only animal that can do all

100
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:17,310
this with are articulated in our tongue
soon as we start laughing

101
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,969
none of that happens remember all this
stuff going on down at the ribcage and

102
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:22,319
then up with the mouth

103
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:29,069
everything is just flat this is
something laughing in the scanner and

104
00:07:29,069 --> 00:07:33,330
the tongue fishing at the bottom of the
mouth and mouse just open

105
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,400
nothing complicated this happening at
all it's an unbelievably primitive way

106
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,020
of making a sound

107
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:47,639
notice how this place here is narrowing
up if you've gotta laugh to your throat

108
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:50,729
that's why the fairings going to be
stripped

109
00:07:52,490 --> 00:07:58,490
what this means in practice is that when
you laugh you're forcing out more air

110
00:07:58,490 --> 00:08:02,210
than you normally force out and if you
forcing out through a narrow pipe that

111
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,388
means you can start to get really high
pitched noises

112
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:08,630
I've got a really high-pitched laugh I
could never take my voice out there to

113
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:13,099
sing deliberately that we got the first
thing that happens when someone's

114
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,759
talking they start laughing often
therefore is actually a disruption of

115
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:19,849
the pitch of the voice because it's
their breath control that they're losing

116
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:24,500
so I've got an example here and somebody
trying to do a radio broadcast when she

117
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:34,339
hears something that she finds amusing
play the picture voice is shown here in

118
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:37,339
blue

119
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:46,490
singing rocks on popular replacement is
now being dismissed with the Army's

120
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,880
popular chief of staff jackwad taking
over the forces with sperm whale which

121
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,870
was stranded in the third or fourth for
more than four days is now thought to be

122
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,150
swimming towards open waters again

123
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,620
it freed itself late last night marine
experts are hoping to establish this

124
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,340
morning

125
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:09,140
whether the way it's gonna be back at
sea good luck to the whale

126
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:13,189
ten past eight at the time an
investigation is underway with me now if

127
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,610
you were with human voices there's a lot
to love about this recording i really

128
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:20,270
like the way the guy coming down the
line has got to say a silly name he's

129
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,550
got to say Jack tracks and he just goes
for it

130
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:27,620
nothing to see here popular chief of
staff jacked what and there we go out

131
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:30,710
there and if you listen very very
carefully back in the studio

132
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:34,730
somebody leans into charlotte green
because she's the broadcaster and they

133
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:40,580
go right at her and they doing that for
one reason and one reason only they're

134
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,250
trying to make her laugh and it works so
she starts talking about the whale and

135
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:50,540
she's doing ok and then you start to see
a systematically losing control of the

136
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:55,280
pitch voice and then towards the end
which picture of those shoots right up

137
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:59,569
by the end of the utterance she
continues making noises after she

138
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,890
stopped talking

139
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,670
this is a woman who is paid on the radio
to talk she'll get in trouble for that

140
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,410
she knows she'll get in trouble for this

141
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:09,829
she can't stop doing it and she's making
this funny noise at the end caused by

142
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,700
this stage she is now laughing and she
can't do anything about it

143
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,270
so you sort of see this evolution from a
loss of pitch control through to

144
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:25,280
actually over laughing now one of the
things that we found in the human brain

145
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,699
is that the human brain really

146
00:10:27,699 --> 00:10:35,679
he really likes laughter it's an
extremely alerting and sort of directive

147
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,269
sound you're always trying to work out
why people laughing we noticed this a

148
00:10:40,269 --> 00:10:42,309
few years ago when we play people

149
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:46,689
laughter in the scanner and we noticed a
lot we were playing other emotional

150
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,449
noises we weren't particularly
interested in laughter at the time we

151
00:10:49,449 --> 00:10:52,599
were using because it's very very
positive people right it's very positive

152
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,290
and we were comparing it to a negative
sounds like screaming sounds and the

153
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:01,299
disgusted sounds and what we noticed was
we got what like quite a strong

154
00:11:01,299 --> 00:11:06,069
contagion effect when people heard
laughter look like people were getting

155
00:11:06,069 --> 00:11:10,238
ready to move their faces and their use
their voices when they heard laughter

156
00:11:10,239 --> 00:11:11,769
movie redder and of course

157
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,309
laughter is unbelievably behaviorally
contagious

158
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:18,549
not only emotionally contagious because
that's the job of emotions and that's

159
00:11:18,549 --> 00:11:22,540
what we were looking at laughter along
with a few other human behaviour is

160
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,769
extremely behaviourally contagious if
you can very frequently find yourself

161
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:30,040
laughing even if you've got no idea why
other people are laughing and you're

162
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,829
much more likely to do that with
somebody you know that someone you don't

163
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:33,309
know

164
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,100
now there's nothing peculiar about
larger in this respect that's quite a

165
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,589
lot of behaviors we do that have this
characteristic

166
00:11:38,589 --> 00:11:42,009
so you're learning works this way you
can catch your own from somebody else

167
00:11:42,009 --> 00:11:44,679
and you're much more likely to catch you
on from someone you know that someone

168
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:49,029
you don't know i used to use a picture
of my son to make this point about your

169
00:11:49,029 --> 00:11:52,029
learning and somebody pointed at do you
notice you always your enough to show

170
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:54,789
the photograph nobody else yours they
don't know who it is I haven't said it

171
00:11:54,789 --> 00:11:58,179
is but I start your name actually
weirdly and there's probably a whole

172
00:11:58,179 --> 00:11:59,169
other talk in this

173
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:02,739
there was a lot of other contagious
behavior that we going for including

174
00:12:02,739 --> 00:12:06,220
blinking blinking is contagious try that
one out with your friends when you get

175
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:10,329
out of here but there's just a lot of
human behavior that we do that we were

176
00:12:10,329 --> 00:12:14,829
sort of picking up for other people to
show affiliation and friendship and of

177
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:18,758
course that's one of the key features of
laughter if you ask people about

178
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:23,169
laughter if you ask them why they laugh
they will talk about jokes and humor and

179
00:12:23,169 --> 00:12:23,889
comedy

180
00:12:23,889 --> 00:12:27,249
if you look at them and you look at when
they left they love when they're with

181
00:12:27,249 --> 00:12:30,609
other people it's a completely social
behavior

182
00:12:30,609 --> 00:12:31,640
so your third

183
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,560
30 30 times more likely to laugh there
is somebody else with you

184
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,800
then if you are on your own and you will
love more if you like those people you

185
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,349
know those people you want them to like
you

186
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:45,920
so it's got this enormously social
aspect

187
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,880
what this means in practice is that
where we love most is when we're talking

188
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,740
to other people because that's what we
do when we with other people and that

189
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,710
the ingredient within those
conversations if you really look at them

190
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:02,030
what you find these people still are not
laughing at jokes they're laughing its

191
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:07,010
statements like I might miss the bus or
I'm going to get a cup of coffee and in

192
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,540
fact at any one time

193
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:12,020
the person who lost most of the person
who's talking it's part of their

194
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:17,060
communicative act now that's quite
interesting because that suggested some

195
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:22,310
laughter that you're encountering this
social after isn't helpless involuntary

196
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:25,880
laughter like I was playing at the start
another social after seems to be quite

197
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,380
i'm in communicative you're choosing at
some level to produce it

198
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:34,010
so we started looking more at this and
to do this what we did what we did we

199
00:13:34,010 --> 00:13:39,470
got people into our anechoic chamber and
we did whatever we could to make them

200
00:13:39,470 --> 00:13:41,630
laugh short of tickling each other

201
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:45,050
we literally whatever it too except for
example to make me love I just have to

202
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:49,729
have a friend of mine and I can see her
and she's listening to something really

203
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:52,520
rude that I know makes her want to start
laughing and that will make me start

204
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,439
laughing and I just watch stuff on my
own

205
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,410
I sit there and don't love whatever it
takes somebody else had to watch an

206
00:13:57,410 --> 00:14:01,850
entire episode of curb your enthusiasm
they specify the episode they specified

207
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:05,390
who had to be sitting next to them and
they said this is what I will love and

208
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:08,689
they did laughs and that's great we got
this lovely laughter and get those same

209
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:12,500
people to produce last week said imagine
your friends tell the joke in your

210
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:15,320
laughing because you like your friends
not because you know you're not laughing

211
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:19,970
help us they would certainly didn't want
kind of haha laughter so I've got some

212
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,440
of those things going to play you

213
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,220
so does this laugh sound like it's a
helpless involuntary laughter do you

214
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,220
think it's a real laugh

215
00:14:28,899 --> 00:14:41,199
real posed with real it's me i'm the
best at the very high pitched well how

216
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:42,128
about this one

217
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:45,129
real post haha

218
00:14:46,629 --> 00:14:51,490
interestingly we did an acoustic
analysis of these you're right that is

219
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,329
posed

220
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,689
now the real laughs there longer they're
higher in pitch because of all these

221
00:14:55,689 --> 00:14:59,349
pressure that your generation when
you're laughing helplessly interesting

222
00:14:59,350 --> 00:15:03,459
the post last they're not just weak
motions of real laughs they've got their

223
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:10,929
own thing going on so that laughs I just
played is really nasal quality to it and

224
00:15:10,929 --> 00:15:15,490
in fact that is very common in the UK
for social laughter we're actually

225
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:19,179
marking our laughter you couldn't do
that with your self palette with your

226
00:15:19,179 --> 00:15:23,199
nose when you're laughing helplessly
we're showing people i'm giving you this

227
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,889
laughter it's a really important sign
and this again

228
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:30,339
the brain cares about it so in this
study we took the different source of

229
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:33,220
laughs we didn't tell people who is a
study on after we didn't tell me

230
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,980
anything about what was going on that we
just put them in the scanner played lots

231
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:39,279
of sounds some of them all off some of
the more real some of the proposed and

232
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,649
then afterwards we look to see what the
results were and what we found was that

233
00:15:44,649 --> 00:15:47,980
although we did not tell people it was a
laugh - 30 we didn't tell him there was

234
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,689
real imposed large in there

235
00:15:49,689 --> 00:15:52,809
the brain cares what you get the regions
in blue

236
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,459
in order to parts of the brain respond
much more strongly to the real laughs

237
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:00,790
probably because you hear an ambiguously
the sounds you never hear in any other

238
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:05,230
context when somebody's laughing
helplessly in contrast these regions in

239
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:10,360
pink very extensive areas of the brain
care about the pose laughter and these

240
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,499
are areas of the brain

241
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:16,360
you would see activated if somebody was
making decisions about what they think

242
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,629
somebody else is thinking their
so-called mentalizing areas now people

243
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:23,259
weren't doing anything here they're just
listening when you hear somebody clearly

244
00:16:23,259 --> 00:16:29,079
faking a lot of haha you are trying to
work out why there's a reason why that

245
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:29,979
person is doing

246
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:33,460
maybe they're embarrassed maybe they're
in pain maybe they're angry

247
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,070
maybe they're trying to get someone to
like them all these things we use

248
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:40,240
laughter for you are trying to work out
why because it's an immensely important

249
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,420
signal even if you don't necessarily
think it's got anything to do with you

250
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,079
and very very briefly

251
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:51,610
we've been looking at this in terms of
behavioral changes in with age so if you

252
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,760
take this real impose laughter and this
is age of people that here we've got

253
00:16:54,760 --> 00:17:00,640
hundreds of participants and what you
see is that the older you get the more

254
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:09,220
real the real laughter sounds and in
fact somewhat more slowly it takes you

255
00:17:09,220 --> 00:17:13,930
longer to work out about the pose
laughter and in fact people's behavior

256
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:19,060
does not start to like get perfect with
recognizing post left of what it is

257
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,990
until they're in their late thirties

258
00:17:22,990 --> 00:17:26,980
so it's not sort of that by the time you
hit puberty it's not sort of that by the

259
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,220
time your brain is fully matured at the
end of your team's you are learning

260
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,090
about what laughter mean throughout your
entire early adult life and that's

261
00:17:34,090 --> 00:17:38,080
probably because the only place you can
learn about it is backing these social

262
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,730
interactions you do not stop learning
about this now

263
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,649
I've kind of describe laughter is an
important behavior and I just want to

264
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,550
end on importa . suggest it may be even
more important than that so I'm kind of

265
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,850
stressed its social role and it's
something we do more with other people

266
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,879
when we were there other people were
laughing to show them that we like them

267
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:01,390
we might even love them we agree with
them we understand them

268
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:04,270
we are part of the same group and then
you're doing all this affiliate of work

269
00:18:04,270 --> 00:18:08,230
with your laughter but maybe even more
important than that there's really nice

270
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:11,650
work coming out of the u.s. from Robert
Levinson slab where he does work with

271
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:16,360
couples and he gets couples over many of
these a prospective study it's been

272
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:20,050
running for decades they get them into
the lab they were the matter polygraph

273
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:23,889
it's very heteronormative there was a
man and a woman and he sits them down

274
00:18:23,890 --> 00:18:26,800
and they're all wired up so you can see
how their blood pressure is going and

275
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,000
how the pulse is going

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,660
how much they're sweating and he says to
one of them delivered because the most

277
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:33,820
stressful question is just one of them

278
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:38,260
tell me something your husband does that
irritate you

279
00:18:38,260 --> 00:18:41,500
and they're just just run that one
through your head

280
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:46,210
think about in front of your closest
loved ones saying to them to their face

281
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:51,610
something they do the irritates you what
he finds is the couples who deal with

282
00:18:51,610 --> 00:18:56,649
that with what he calls a positive
effort but he means laughter not only

283
00:18:56,650 --> 00:19:01,360
immediately become less stressed you see
them getting on top of the stress they

284
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:05,560
feel better and they have only works if
they do it together if one person is

285
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,790
going

286
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:10,450
haha together is very funny the first
person is going no it's a massive

287
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,710
problem

288
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:15,610
no one feels better so only they both
laugh do you see this reduction in

289
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,399
stress but also on longer time scale the
other couples who are happier in their

290
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,720
relationship and they all the couples
who stay together for longer so laughter

291
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,400
isn't just a sign that were using
socially to indicate that we know people

292
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,940
and we like people with people that
we've got strong emotional connections

293
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,510
to and i suspect that this is not going
to be only two of romantic relationships

294
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:42,070
it's actually one of the ways that we
manage emotionally difficult situations

295
00:19:42,070 --> 00:19:46,000
and we regulate our emotions together
and it only works if you all do it

296
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,750
together

297
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:50,740
now Robert Levinson has some really
beautiful films of elderly couples make

298
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,430
each other laugh and it really warms
your heart I don't have that i've got a

299
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,390
video I make from youtube of some young
men in the former East Germany making a

300
00:19:58,390 --> 00:20:03,250
film about the heavy metal band now I've
edited out considerable amount of

301
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:08,740
swearing which is in english but i want
you to notice is how the emotional tone

302
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:12,220
changes when something goes wrong and
something does go wrong

303
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:16,270
so it starts out with a lot of bravado
certain amount of nudity he's expecting

304
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:18,870
to get cold and he's expecting to get
wet

305
00:20:18,870 --> 00:20:23,610
miss Olivia had it's clearly this guy's
the house soon talking about you maybe

306
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:29,669
you don't like football or soon to
swallow a nice ice hear you but got a

307
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,700
white guy and he's got a spot of my
friends and even yeah

308
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:37,710
when he starts wearing it's quite a lot
of fun just let me off the other off

309
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:44,130
oh and my new plant is called siskiyou
now

310
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:50,309
his friends are already laughing really
hard and you know it yet

311
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,059
it will keep going home absolutely

312
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:58,230
he starts going around

313
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:16,678
collapse

314
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:38,100
now i'm lucky enough to have a job with
people frequently send me youtube videos

315
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:40,830
and say look at the laughter on this and
I've been sent this one several times by

316
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:44,610
people saying it's a great example of
some chard android were laughing because

317
00:21:44,610 --> 00:21:48,419
something goes wrong with it is much
more complex than that because the mood

318
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,200
before hand is serious and then what
they all expect to happen

319
00:21:52,770 --> 00:21:56,370
he's going to go through the ice he's
going to get cold and wet when that

320
00:21:56,370 --> 00:22:00,300
doesn't happen but also is not blood and
bone everywhere

321
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,610
his friends start laughing it takes a
couple of beats and then he starts

322
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:10,139
laughing - and that's actually how
they're managing what could be a painful

323
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:11,429
embarrassing

324
00:22:11,429 --> 00:22:15,059
you might be cross you might be
embarrassed or so you know stop filming

325
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,139
me what's going on

326
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:19,230
all of that could be going on and you
just imagine the situation if he was

327
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:22,650
lying there with a visibly broken leg
and his friends were laughing like

328
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:26,070
he was going please please take me to
the hospital it would be awful

329
00:22:26,070 --> 00:22:29,490
we would not enjoy watching it similarly
if he was running around with a visibly

330
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:33,120
broken like going this is just hilarious
and his friends are going

331
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,120
Henry I'm not being funny got to come
back again we wouldn't be laughing

332
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:41,940
one of the things we enjoy about this is
actually seeing people using laughter to

333
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,210
regulate those emotions that's the same
thing i suspect the Robert Levinson is

334
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,740
looking at but just friends friends in
fact I suspect that might be what we

335
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,830
mean by friendship people with whom we
can use laughter in that way so I think

336
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,120
scientifically

337
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:03,540
it's time to start taking laughter much
more seriously thank you

338
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:11,830
we got time for a couple of questions
I've got one actually to begin with

339
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:18,699
yep have you done much research into why
we laugh much less research so there is

340
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,560
a lot of research into humor and I think
that's a very interesting field of

341
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:26,379
research but i think one of the problems
with it is most of the time when we love

342
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,760
out in the wild they're not laughing at
humor so humor is very interesting

343
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:35,110
this seems to be much more of a new
mother ever social emotion than we

344
00:23:35,110 --> 00:23:37,899
normally give it credit for and you only
really find out you're going to look at

345
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,880
people say they asked people they'll say
I joke

346
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:43,930
I laugh at jokes and humor actually you
love most the time when you're with

347
00:23:43,930 --> 00:23:46,990
other people and you're laughing as much
because you like them and how you feel

348
00:23:46,990 --> 00:23:52,960
about them as it is because of anything
they've actually done it to us

349
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:55,960
don't you run to the bank

350
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:04,600
so I don't know if I miss this because i
was slightly late

351
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:07,750
what are other species

352
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:11,530
look to other species laughs and
human-like way very good question i

353
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:17,139
didn't mention this so if you look you
find laughter in the other great apes

354
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:21,100
so it looks and sounds very much light
laughter gorillas love

355
00:24:21,100 --> 00:24:27,189
orangatang love chimpanzees love if you
look more generally and people the

356
00:24:27,190 --> 00:24:30,549
problem is people aren't really doing
this but for example yank tank set

357
00:24:30,549 --> 00:24:34,570
who's there not to work with rats in the
US has found that Layla as well

358
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:37,149
they left they make a particular vocal
behavior when they're playing with each

359
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:40,540
other and then make the same behavior if
they're being tickled

360
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:43,659
and if you tickle them every day they
make the sound when they see you coming

361
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:48,850
to the lab so it's actually Steve
anticipate or ii and you can encourage

362
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:52,480
laughter in rats so the more you tickle
baby rats the more it will laugh when

363
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:57,820
it's as an older at so it does seem to
it doesn't sound like laughter but it's

364
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:03,159
situation extremely similar so like with
humans and retains and rachie first he

365
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:07,870
loved to emerge when babies have an
interaction with their caregivers often

366
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,949
it's tickling with humans and this is
maybe something specific to humans

367
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:17,049
it can also be peekaboo so maybe one
thing is about dead humans we don't

368
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:20,590
necessarily have to have the physical
contact but they will let their the

369
00:25:20,590 --> 00:25:24,428
grounding in other mammals is still
there between infants and caregivers

370
00:25:24,429 --> 00:25:28,660
that seems to be where you first see
laughter appearing and it seems to argue

371
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:32,169
for laughter so yet when it first
emerged as being a social bonding

372
00:25:32,169 --> 00:25:33,340
mechanism

373
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:39,490
do any of these other animals laugh in
the way that you showed their of

374
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:43,419
responding to events there is a purely
social

375
00:25:43,929 --> 00:25:49,299
there's some evidence from chimpanzees
that they chimpanzees have two different

376
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:50,590
sorts of laughs

377
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:53,949
they love differently if they're being
tickled

378
00:25:53,950 --> 00:25:57,490
then if they're trying to make play last
longer

379
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:02,770
that sounds a lot like our social after
and are involuntary laughter with

380
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:05,190
involuntary laughter being like tickling
in the play

381
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:09,540
laughter being like conversational
laughter so I think it's at least

382
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:13,230
possible that you're saying that
voluntary involuntary distinction in

383
00:26:13,230 --> 00:26:17,790
chimpanzees and we need to know more
work with other other primates to know

384
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,810
that kind of carry don't over into other
primates live intensely social groups

385
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:35,250
and hi i was wondering whether there's
also some research about what it does to

386
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:38,909
us on the long-term sense i mean that
obviously it was going to be happy but I

387
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,380
think about for example this

388
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,590
laughter yoga thing where people on
purpose laughs with each other

389
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:50,700
it is definitely a I mean it feels good
to laugh you feel better when you've

390
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:53,490
been laughing and there are definite
physiological changes that go with that

391
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:58,529
so you get an increase in their bodies
in the circulation of the body's natural

392
00:26:58,529 --> 00:27:03,389
or no so you increase the uptake and
then actually circulating endorphins

393
00:27:03,389 --> 00:27:06,990
when you've been laughing that gives you
a measurable change in pain thresholds

394
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:11,039
anybody here laughs when they're in pain
tends to a handful of people

395
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:14,820
that's probably what you're actually
doing is you're accessing a natural form

396
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:15,960
of pain relief

397
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,649
however that's not specific to laughter
that's actually associated with your

398
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:22,709
body doing some work and you do quite a
lot of work at your rib cage and you're

399
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:23,399
laughing

400
00:27:23,399 --> 00:27:26,939
it's about equivalent to eating an apple
for every 15 minutes of laughter so it's

401
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:30,240
not that much work but probably enough
is enough to give you an endorphin kick

402
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,279
you also and this does seem to be more
specific - laughter get a decrease in

403
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:40,380
adrenaline and over a longer time course
a decreasing cortisol and cortisol

404
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:46,919
adrenaline to fight or flight a hormone
and the reduction in adrenaline the

405
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:50,370
scene when you feel more relaxed you are
not feeling stress you're not feeling

406
00:27:50,370 --> 00:27:56,549
that you've got to run and cortisol is a
slow-acting longer time scale whole mode

407
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:58,830
which is strongly associated with stress

408
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:02,549
it's the hormone that wakes you up in
the morning it's the hormone that is it

409
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:05,549
high levels if you are really stressed
out and that goes down when you've been

410
00:28:05,549 --> 00:28:10,320
laughing so I think what we don't know
is what the contribution is the social

411
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:13,649
elements of laughter from that because
that's when you find laughter or the

412
00:28:13,649 --> 00:28:17,820
actual act of laughing but there's
definitely quite good scientific

413
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:21,299
evidence that is that there are reasons
why you are feeling better and has been

414
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:24,299
laughing

415
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:33,050
hi I'm curious about you talking about
laughter with people you like but I'm

416
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,440
wondering if you done much research
about people going to say how many gigs

417
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:39,440
where there's just lots of people
surrounding you feel like you ought to

418
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,000
laugh because everyone else is

419
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:46,010
we have tried doing looking at audiences
as I haven't given up hope on this one

420
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:50,030
things we found in our studies is the
view take comedy audiences and he shone

421
00:28:50,030 --> 00:28:53,000
bright lights on everybody's faces and
you make me wear breath belts and you

422
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,960
put on motion capture devices and you
film them they stopped laughing

423
00:28:57,470 --> 00:29:00,890
it's very very quick and they just sit
there going about Christ what's going on

424
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:04,160
and the only comedian has a horrible
time and no one likes you so and it's

425
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:06,800
Betty is very very interesting because
it

426
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,340
I sometimes one of the things I'm
interested in is what happens when you

427
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,060
get a group of people becoming an
audience if you look at how you go to a

428
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:18,320
comedy club in MCB comes out first when
the first thing they'll do is say no

429
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:24,050
good evening penge here's your first
timer , complicated in pens you know you

430
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:27,500
get in to get through this is not making
a noise even for your laughing they try

431
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,290
to get you to behave together they're
trying to do all this stuff to get you

432
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:34,760
up and going to get you laughing and
laughter begets laughter you using its

433
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,629
remember it's hugely contagious so when
you've got people laugh and the chances

434
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:41,720
are that it will be easy to keep in
laughing they trying to keep the energy

435
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,530
up between all the acts that I'm really
interested in detail within that

436
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:50,540
how much is a stand-up comedy act like
the kind of conversational after that I

437
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,930
talked about where it's just a weird
conversation where one person does all

438
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:54,800
the talking

439
00:29:54,800 --> 00:30:00,020
so a lot of their kind of scaling comedy
is obviously what you say he's got to be

440
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:04,910
funny but you're in your it's a very new
skill and we're used to find people

441
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:09,260
would do a kind of dead air punch line
but i'm tish and the audience we got a

442
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:14,629
cute laugh and nowadays people don't go
dum tish but you will see people go and

443
00:30:14,630 --> 00:30:17,280
that was why I never go to

444
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:23,220
I'm not gonna work that's why I never go
to Blackburn and I'll take a drink or

445
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,310
they'll take a step forward for that
little smile it all sorts of little

446
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:26,940
stuff

447
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:30,930
let me ck is a massive number little
tipsy little shows fine i just said

448
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:35,940
something really inappropriate you can
laugh - this and that kind of Q and then

449
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,240
train and i'm really interested in
because I they you know one level we

450
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,020
think of stand-up comedy is being up you
know a verbal skills and is a verbal

451
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,010
skill but how much they also kind of in
training the audience much as we know

452
00:30:47,010 --> 00:30:51,060
people can laugh together in
conversation so they kind of repurposing

453
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:55,409
that in a calm environment so one day I
will find the comedian who is so popular

454
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:59,580
with his his or her audience that the
audience won't care that i'm filming the

455
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,129
more than I measuring the mall and
they'll just be enjoying it and

456
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,620
hopefully i'll get an answer for you

457
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:11,010
thanks to last one on the way what was
your favorite joke

458
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,520
my favorite joke

459
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:23,799
I do really like what's around and
sounds like a trumpet a Crump it up

460
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:33,010
not very sophisticated that's what I am
very interested I'm interested really in

461
00:31:33,010 --> 00:31:35,230
the evilution of the action

462
00:31:35,230 --> 00:31:39,039
you know I didn't seem to me very basic
compared to talking

463
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:43,179
yes does that mean that it comes from
you know the basic noises that the Apes

464
00:31:43,179 --> 00:31:43,960
make

465
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,370
yes exactly exactly so the reason I
started looking at laughter because i

466
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:51,580
was looking at these non verbal
emotional vocalizations things like you

467
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,658
know your howling in grief or you'll
make it sound or you're screaming

468
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:00,970
because you're scared when those really
involuntary sounds are actually part of

469
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:05,440
an older evolutionary pathway that's got
much more in common with how all mammals

470
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:09,820
vocalize and like and actually the
sounds themselves and not like speech

471
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:13,360
there primarily to do with moving your
ribcage moving you make it sound at the

472
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:17,350
links you don't do much up here and that
was why I was looking at laughter at all

473
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:21,549
I wasn't lookin at laughs - I didn't
have never even thought about it as a as

474
00:32:21,549 --> 00:32:24,970
a thing on its own i was just looking at
it as a positive kind of these examples

475
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:29,799
so one of the best sources of evidence
of this is people to humans have got

476
00:32:29,799 --> 00:32:32,799
this old evolutionary pathway like all
other mammals we have also evolved

477
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,400
what's called these lateral motor areas
which are here and we use them for

478
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,970
talking and their specific to us and
they do all that motor control for

479
00:32:39,970 --> 00:32:44,350
speaking if you have damage to those
systems for example following a stroke

480
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:48,850
you can be left with a broken found a
phase easier you can't speak anymore but

481
00:32:48,850 --> 00:32:52,689
you can still laugh you can still cry
you can still do all these older

482
00:32:52,690 --> 00:32:55,240
evolutionarily older vocal behaviour

483
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:58,270
so it does seem to be part of a
different pathway and as you say exactly

484
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:04,600
it is older perhaps explains why you get
so much brain activity because sorry

485
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,590
because

486
00:33:05,590 --> 00:33:08,918
perhaps helps explain why there's so
much brain activity when you're here in

487
00:33:08,919 --> 00:33:17,620
somebody laughing yeah it is yeah old
communication and i think that's that's

488
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:18,908
it for time of questions

489
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:22,059
thank you very much Andy so if you thank
you thank you mrs. Potter
