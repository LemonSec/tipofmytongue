1
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:19,230
hello hello everyone thank you very much

2
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:22,380
for coming so yes this can be

3
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:24,869
mathematical view of voting systems so

4
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,260
the great thing about maths is that it

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,949
gives you this really precise language

6
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:34,050
that we can express things in so we can

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,870
write statements that have that have no

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,079
ambiguity which is different from normal

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:41,670
speech so in normal speech might say how

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:44,370
the voting system isn't fair but that

11
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:46,789
could have various different meanings

12
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:49,680
but we can actually apply specific

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,489
precise unambiguous maths language to

14
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:55,440
voting systems and we can make

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,440
definitions prove theorems provide

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,260
examples and counter examples and do all

17
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,449
of that to show stuff about voting

18
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:07,710
systems so an electorate is fined as a

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,680
set of voters and voters have transitive

20
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,060
preferences so if voter say transitive

21
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,909
means if a voter prefers X to Y and

22
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:20,159
prefers white Zed then they must prefer

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,049
X to Z but even though all the people in

24
00:01:25,049 --> 00:01:27,960
the electorate have transitive

25
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,329
preferences it doesn't mean that the

26
00:01:30,329 --> 00:01:32,189
electorate overall will have transitive

27
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:34,259
preferences so the table there gives you

28
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,360
an example of one where there aren't

29
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,689
transitive preferences two people prefer

30
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:42,930
x 2 y 2 people prefer y 2 Z and two

31
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,270
people for prefers there 2x so there's

32
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:47,880
no way that there's no resolution here

33
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:51,780
in making a transitive preference system

34
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,299
that pleases everyone so a voting system

35
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,430
is just defined as an algorithm so it

36
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,030
takes in a set of n so the supposes n

37
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,689
voters it takes in their preferences

38
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:09,820
does some computation and outputs

39
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:14,450
ranking of the candidates so formally if

40
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,930
you have a set of n possible rankings of

41
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:20,120
candidates the algorithm is a function

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,680
that outputs just a single ranking of

43
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,530
candidates from them so for example

44
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:25,940
first-past-the-post is the simplest one

45
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:29,330
any any preferences except for first

46
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:32,090
preferences are just ignored so you york

47
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:33,380
the vote is only allowed to give their

48
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,600
first preference and whichever of the

49
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,610
first preferences is most popular just

50
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,590
win straightaways that's an example of

51
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:42,310
the probably the simplest voting system

52
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,190
so if there are exactly two candidates

53
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,459
in an election there is good news

54
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,370
provided by Mays theorem so suppose we

55
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:54,500
want a voting system there's two

56
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,510
candidates and we want every voter to

57
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,810
have the same influence and so on the

58
00:02:59,810 --> 00:03:02,750
screen I've the have a way of expressing

59
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,630
this in precise mathematical language so

60
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,760
each boat has the same influence the

61
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,010
winning conditions are identical for

62
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:12,980
both candidates so for example if one

63
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,900
candidate needed sixty percent of the

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:17,690
vote to win that wouldn't be that the

65
00:03:17,690 --> 00:03:19,450
same condition for both candidates and

66
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,450
if C 2 is not more popular than C 1 if

67
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:25,310
candidate to is not more popular than

68
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,320
candidate one and then candidate one

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,690
becomes more popular candidate one must

70
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,430
still win so these are three fairly

71
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:34,250
straightforward fairly like minimal

72
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,380
requirements for a voting system and may

73
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,989
theorem says first-past-the-post where

74
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,250
everyone just votes which is their

75
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:42,200
favorite or abstains if they're

76
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,150
indifferent between them and then you go

77
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,830
with whichever is the most popular that

78
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,780
is the only system that satisfies all

79
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:51,230
these criteria so that's that's the good

80
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:56,750
news and so a brief side look at

81
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:59,030
changing the status quo when there are

82
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,549
kind of two candidates but also kind of

83
00:04:01,549 --> 00:04:04,430
aren't two candidates so suppose there's

84
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:06,620
a multi suppose there's multiple

85
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,720
alternatives for the status quo so for

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,200
example if you wanted to say should we

87
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,720
change the national anthem or something

88
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,760
you might say well maybe but it depends

89
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:19,789
all we're going to change it to so you

90
00:04:19,789 --> 00:04:22,280
might say yeah I'm not

91
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:24,470
I'm not too unhappy about changing it

92
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,030
but it would have to be a good

93
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,850
alternative anthem so always problem

94
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,620
with this with just having a should we

95
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:33,290
change it or not problem is that let's

96
00:04:33,290 --> 00:04:35,150
say just under a majority of people

97
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,610
could favor staying with the status quo

98
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:40,300
and the status quo could be any

99
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:43,389
alternative in a one-on-one competition

100
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,000
but it could still lose if every if if

101
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,230
we just have a simple should we change

102
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,400
or not and so after the after we've

103
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,800
after the stakes after we moved to the

104
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,480
alternative and then choose which of the

105
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,190
alternatives we want there could be a

106
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:00,440
majority who are saying actually I would

107
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,330
have rather we just stayed with the

108
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:05,060
original one so the solution is similar

109
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:07,400
to New Zealand's referendum on changing

110
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,730
that flag in that they had a rare had a

111
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:13,430
vote first on what the alternative flag

112
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,680
should be and then put it up against the

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,050
current flag in a one on one vote so

114
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,030
that people majority would definitely be

115
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:22,580
happy with the decision okay so we have

116
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:24,440
the good news with mace theorem let's

117
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,450
have look at the bad news if there are

118
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:30,229
more than two candidates so we want

119
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:34,010
every voter if every single voter

120
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:37,040
prefers Candida exa candidate why the

121
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,620
the voting system must say x is better

122
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,630
than what I does if every every single

123
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:44,330
voter agrees then we must have that in

124
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:48,340
the output and now the second condition

125
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,030
independence of irrelevant alternatives

126
00:05:50,030 --> 00:05:54,860
if X is ranked if the system system says

127
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:58,580
X is better than Y and then some of the

128
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,190
candidate said doesn't not X or Y some

129
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:02,900
other candidate becomes more popular

130
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,490
then x is better than why can't change

131
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,710
so so you know suppose you're choosing a

132
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:12,050
candidate for a job and you say yet well

133
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:13,729
I think the first candidate was

134
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:14,900
definitely better than the second

135
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,760
candidate like we're agreed on that and

136
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,450
then a third candidate comes along who

137
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,440
he doesn't tell you anything about

138
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,360
candidates one and two you say actually

139
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,430
now have seen candidate three I think

140
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,960
candidate twos better than candidate won

141
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,000
by this extra information that doesn't

142
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,919
tell you anything about the first two

143
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,650
candidate shouldn't affect your your

144
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:34,800
opinion of them

145
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,319
and there should be no dictator so there

146
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,659
shouldn't just be a single voter who

147
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,639
says oh well if I'm going I vote

148
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:43,409
whichever way I vote that's the way the

149
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,580
election will go so there's no

150
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,879
pre-specified person who bet they're the

151
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:50,460
only vote that counts so no there's no

152
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:52,500
system that satisfies these three

153
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,009
conditions and the most commonly

154
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:57,090
unsatisfied condition is the second one

155
00:06:57,090 --> 00:06:58,470
independence of all irrelevant

156
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,870
alternatives so let's have a look at

157
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,169
that in first past the post so suppose

158
00:07:04,169 --> 00:07:06,599
you've got these preferences so there's

159
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:09,060
110 people who like X said why 102like

160
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,090
why exert an eight people like zxy

161
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:13,050
suppose nine people change their

162
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:14,250
preference from the first one to the

163
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:19,169
third one then why would win who did why

164
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:23,310
is still as unliked as before people

165
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:25,139
still say anyone would be better than

166
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:27,479
why I'd prefer X to Y prefer Zed to why

167
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,020
anyone but why but because some people

168
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,449
say actually yeah maybe Zed is the bets

169
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,990
or of Exim X and said now's now I lip

170
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:39,569
now I wins since violence independence

171
00:07:39,569 --> 00:07:42,389
of irrelevant alternatives and also

172
00:07:42,389 --> 00:07:44,340
violates the majority loser criterion so

173
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,440
you can elect unpopular candidate so you

174
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,770
can elect candidates who say yeah

175
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,110
majority of people say anyone but this

176
00:07:52,110 --> 00:07:55,560
candidate and they can still win so

177
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,180
let's have a look at the alternative

178
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:59,580
vote so some definite so just quick

179
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,610
definition of it the voters rank their

180
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:03,750
candidates rather than just putting the

181
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,789
first preference you count up the first

182
00:08:05,789 --> 00:08:07,830
preferences if someone has a majority

183
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,159
then they immediately win otherwise

184
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,360
whoever has a few as folks gets knocked

185
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,430
out and therefore their second

186
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,409
preferences turn into first preferences

187
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:18,659
and then you just repeat it until

188
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:21,650
someone has a majority and they win and

189
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:26,969
so this one wait oh yes sorry I missed

190
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:33,149
this one okay so the problem with first

191
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:34,198
off the post is that you can have these

192
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:36,328
clones so if two candidates are kind of

193
00:08:36,328 --> 00:08:38,279
ranked next to each other like x and z

194
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:41,698
are then they harm each other because

195
00:08:41,698 --> 00:08:44,370
they split the vote so if you want to

196
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,810
win a first-past-the-post election just

197
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,399
clone your opponent just make it just

198
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:48,180
make the candidates

199
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:51,360
really similar to them so AV is clone

200
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,399
proof if you have two candidates who are

201
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,890
ranked who always ranked next to each

202
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,390
other people say yeah these few

203
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:59,730
candidates are roughly the same if one

204
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:00,960
of them didn't run it wouldn't make any

205
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,880
difference to the to the other

206
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,670
candidates so that's guaranteed

207
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,870
mathematically it also satisfies

208
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:11,220
majority loser criterion so if as one

209
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,350
candidate more than half the people say

210
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:14,970
any wonder that candidate then they

211
00:09:14,970 --> 00:09:20,580
can't win so is av just a better system

212
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:24,510
no so suppose that we have an election

213
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:27,959
and X get some ranking let's say X wins

214
00:09:27,959 --> 00:09:30,990
and then the electorate change and they

215
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,020
say actually we like X even more now and

216
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:36,240
we have the second election we're exes

217
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,730
II exes you know let's say X wins the

218
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,459
first election then X serves that and

219
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,649
then they're even more popular next time

220
00:09:43,649 --> 00:09:46,020
around that shouldn't hurt x.x should

221
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:49,920
just win again right baby isn't monotone

222
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,110
it does us a monitoring condition AV

223
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:53,910
isn't monotone if a candidate becomes

224
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,279
more popular it can actually harm them

225
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,690
which is a particular vulnerable AV has

226
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:03,380
this problem first-past-the-post doesn't

227
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,940
so let's give an example so in the first

228
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:12,270
vote we have W has nine votes excess 6y

229
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:15,180
has six and set us five so said is

230
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:19,709
knocked out and then what W has nine

231
00:10:19,709 --> 00:10:22,740
votes X has 11 and why has six so Y goes

232
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:26,490
out wise votes get sent to X and so in

233
00:10:26,490 --> 00:10:29,400
the final result w has nine and X are 17

234
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,620
so X would win that vote so that's the

235
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,410
first election then suppose the voters

236
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:37,290
change to voters prime with the

237
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,970
apostrophe so now in the first round why

238
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,920
is the least popular candidate rather

239
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,950
than Zed so why is eliminated first why

240
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,880
second votes go to Z so now it's w has 9

241
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:53,640
X has eight and said has nine so X gets

242
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,800
an opt out in the second round so not an

243
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,660
air voids transfer to Zed so as Edwards

244
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,870
with a majority now dirt 2 and the same

245
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:01,920
majorities x had before

246
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,220
or so X lost by becoming more popular in

247
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:10,410
this case yep and also doesn't satisfy

248
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,290
the participation criterion so you can

249
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:16,079
be in the situation where you will you

250
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:18,449
get a better outcome for yourself if you

251
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:21,600
don't vote at all so let's say this kind

252
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,290
of three those three that this Tennessee

253
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,360
is choosing a new state capital and

254
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,519
people want to be near to the capital as

255
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,260
possible and live in the capital if they

256
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,779
can so there's three kind of cities on

257
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:36,180
one side and Memphis which is right in

258
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:37,769
the bottom corner that is the most

259
00:11:37,769 --> 00:11:41,490
populous so we've got Memphis's majority

260
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:44,130
loser there's the three other cities

261
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:45,360
would rather have anyone but Memphis

262
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,600
because they're all closer to each other

263
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,510
so straight away well to me it seems

264
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,130
obvious that Nashville is that kind of

265
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,860
compromise winner should should be the

266
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:59,610
compromise winner here because it's kind

267
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,350
of in the middle and it has a fair

268
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,600
amount of support on its own anyway but

269
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,100
the problem is that Memphis voters

270
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:11,160
because they're popular but not quite

271
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,920
popular not unpopular enough to get

272
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,660
knocked out their votes never get

273
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,970
reassigned there are 140 to percents

274
00:12:17,970 --> 00:12:20,250
they're not going to be eliminated so

275
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,810
what happens is Chattanooga voters get

276
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:23,839
knocked out their votes go to knoxville

277
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:26,370
nashville voters nashville is then the

278
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,870
least popular their votes get knocked

279
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,940
out they go to knoxville so knoxville

280
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:33,000
wins knoxville knoxville wins here even

281
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,800
though it's clearly kind of the extreme

282
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:38,010
candidate at the right hand side away

283
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,130
from everything else yes so if so what

284
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,269
could what could we have done

285
00:12:45,269 --> 00:12:47,220
differently well if Memphis voters if

286
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,560
the figure had been twenty five percent

287
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,980
of original voters rather than 42 if

288
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,170
that if that was what Memphis if people

289
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:57,120
had stopped a few people had voted from

290
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,130
Memphis they would have been knocked out

291
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:00,569
and their votes would have gone to

292
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:02,990
Nashville and Nashville would have won

293
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:06,389
so you can actually so people who vote

294
00:13:06,389 --> 00:13:08,370
from Memphis who voted for Memphis

295
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,800
harmed their own interests because if

296
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,779
you of them were voted that a better

297
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:15,000
candidate for them would have won

298
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,120
yeah so basically with two options you

299
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,050
do have a very good voting system just

300
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,360
choose your favorite but with three or

301
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,190
more candidates things immediately get

302
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:30,120
messy these are two fairly

303
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,760
straightforward to understand systems

304
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,889
but I both have like very undesirable

305
00:13:35,889 --> 00:13:39,399
properties about them so that as I

306
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:41,649
saying before we don't like to use the

307
00:13:41,649 --> 00:13:44,649
sort of nonspecific language but there's

308
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:46,810
no with arrows theorem if you consider

309
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,329
that to be a fair system then arrows

310
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,529
theorem shows that there's no fair

311
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:54,550
system and that's kind of a big I don't

312
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,070
know Probert maybe you think it's not a

313
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:00,519
problem with democracy I don't know so

314
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:03,630
used to the side okay thank

315
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:13,370
we've got about five minutes for

316
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,870
questions and I can see I've got

317
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:26,389
question over there so thanks very much

318
00:14:26,389 --> 00:14:28,730
something that I think I guess is quite

319
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,560
important is there's a difference

320
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,110
between this voting system is massively

321
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,670
and obviously flawed in everyday

322
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:37,339
situations and it's possible to come up

323
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:39,290
with a very complicated corner case

324
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,769
where this system fails so is there a

325
00:14:42,769 --> 00:14:48,019
way of quantifying that or quantifying

326
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:49,759
how regularly these failure modes occur

327
00:14:49,759 --> 00:14:53,630
Andrea lections as opposed to in theory

328
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,000
this system can produce this ridiculous

329
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,940
result but it never actually does yeah

330
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:01,839
that's a very good question thank you so

331
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:05,449
some people one estimate for if we

332
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,470
applied alternative vote to UK elections

333
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:11,149
was that it would hardly ever happen

334
00:15:11,149 --> 00:15:14,269
that the monotone criterion would hold

335
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:16,130
would it would fail that people would

336
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:19,100
have been better voting differently I

337
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,190
think that that made quite specific

338
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:26,000
assumptions about how voters would

339
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,160
choose the parties in the future it's

340
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,550
really difficult to make inference about

341
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:33,319
whether and this ever does happen

342
00:15:33,319 --> 00:15:36,470
because people can't release the whole

343
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,569
ranking of candidates so if you if you

344
00:15:38,569 --> 00:15:40,970
for example in Australia they use AV but

345
00:15:40,970 --> 00:15:43,639
there's no list of here's what everyone

346
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:46,339
voted for because you've got you because

347
00:15:46,339 --> 00:15:48,440
someone could say right you know I want

348
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,970
you to list there's 20 candidates list

349
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:52,130
them in this order said that I know that

350
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:55,639
you've done as I've said so we only have

351
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:57,910
information about what was the first

352
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,439
count what was the second count and so

353
00:16:00,439 --> 00:16:02,959
on so it's really difficult to know

354
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,930
whether this does happen with practical

355
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,509
systems it's yeah I mean they think with

356
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,740
first-past-the-post you also have

357
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,110
majority loser thing which other thing

358
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,449
is that most people know that that's a

359
00:16:17,449 --> 00:16:19,910
thing they know that oh well if I vote

360
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:21,260
for the candidate I really like i might

361
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,520
be harming the can

362
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:26,090
I do the worse though you know better of

363
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,490
two evils so people sometimes do vote

364
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:29,980
tactically based on that as well and

365
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,150
they know that us problem try to get

366
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,900
rounder does any of that change with

367
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,490
multi-member systems where there's more

368
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:42,590
than one winner sorry what was the first

369
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:45,050
bit not does it change with multi-member

370
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:46,520
systems where there's more than one

371
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:50,870
winner I so I receiver am only applies

372
00:16:50,870 --> 00:16:54,770
to a single candidate you can single

373
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:58,880
winner election you still I do I think

374
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,800
it I'm not one hundred percent sure I

375
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,320
think it still applies to multi but I'm

376
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,599
not I'm not a hundred percent sure on

377
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:15,020
that I have what's your opinion

378
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:20,300
concordance voting systems what what

379
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,220
about them if this in I know that are

380
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:25,069
computationally right and of intensive

381
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,740
and it's obviously very difficult for a

382
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,420
lot of people to understand how they

383
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:32,030
work and the more things that are

384
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:34,720
involved the heavier the computation get

385
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,910
burn is it possible to actually fix that

386
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:40,460
with more technology and better

387
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:44,780
algorithms yes so more complex

388
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:47,360
algorithms not for doing coding systems

389
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,190
to exist as you're saying that the

390
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:52,190
problem is that you have you would need

391
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,960
to conduct the election on voting

392
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,370
machines which I guess some people don't

393
00:17:55,370 --> 00:18:01,130
like and also people the advantage of

394
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,800
something I first-past-the-post is that

395
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,410
everyone understands how the votes are

396
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:09,290
counted whereas with something that's

397
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:12,550
much smut kind of a smarter system

398
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:15,110
people were done really understand it as

399
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:19,130
much I think yeah if I was if we were

400
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:20,870
doing again if we're starting the whole

401
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:23,080
democracy again we probably would have a

402
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:25,240
smarter system that had fewer

403
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,250
disadvantages but we need to sort of

404
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,500
educate everyone right at the beginning

405
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,390
about exactly why this was a better

406
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:36,000
system so it doesn't

407
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,100
the question I'm not sure okay is there

408
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,840
any way to check whether a system would

409
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:47,310
be liable to tactical voting so there is

410
00:18:47,310 --> 00:18:50,970
a theorem I can't name the name of it

411
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:55,620
it's kind of similar to kind of similar

412
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,540
to arrows theorem that says if everyone

413
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,090
has knowledge about what other people

414
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,010
are voting then every system is

415
00:19:02,010 --> 00:19:08,010
vulnerable to tactical voting is it okay

416
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:11,750
um can we thank you speak again

417
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,310
you
