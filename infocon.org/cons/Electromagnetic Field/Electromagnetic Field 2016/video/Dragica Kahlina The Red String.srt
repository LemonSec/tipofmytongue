1
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:16,750
I am excited to introduce our next talk
the red string coming you all the way

2
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:20,289
from the AL grave tent which I
understand is something that must be

3
00:00:20,289 --> 00:00:23,500
seen like it's a cali not

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,920
thank you

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:33,640
ok i'm talking about the Left red string

6
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:40,989
let me get my tools so what go and i'm
going to talk about

7
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:45,099
there is two kinds of people

8
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:52,119
the one who take deep the experts they
go to the end of Earth or whatever and

9
00:00:52,119 --> 00:00:58,330
then there are the people who do many
things they connect the people who go

10
00:00:58,330 --> 00:00:59,379
deep

11
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:08,740
they sometimes go deep to but they their
life is like many strings they do many

12
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,899
things and I do they do it sometimes in
parallel

13
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:20,050
I got my talk at the right I called my
talk to red string because strings seem

14
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,530
to be a a theme in my life

15
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:31,270
it started when I was six and I wanted
to learn crochet at six I was really bad

16
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:33,789
at crochet now I'm better

17
00:01:33,790 --> 00:01:40,390
it's at least 40 years i'm doing that
now when my first day of my master study

18
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:46,659
at the University began the first thing
I heard my physics professor tell us we

19
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:52,300
are not that biology here you come knit
in the lectures naturally two years

20
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:59,679
later I started with knitting in my
lectures because knitting and crochet

21
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,430
he said are too easy physics is really
hard

22
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:06,909
so crochet is simple can you read that

23
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:14,680
that's lace by the way you can do many
things with crochet and it can be very

24
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,569
complicated and its interconnected and I
never stop that

25
00:02:19,569 --> 00:02:27,129
and I was really really glad when I
found out that they momma

26
00:02:28,299 --> 00:02:36,879
instead of using paper to do more math
and to do math models they mark Amina

27
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:40,268
use crochet to do mouth

28
00:02:40,269 --> 00:02:46,599
this is a hyper complex structure and
she brought the paper about that

29
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:54,069
and since then crocheting has actually a
place in mathematics and biology

30
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:58,209
this is a reef made by many people

31
00:02:58,209 --> 00:03:09,969
corals made holy out of crochet this is
a hyper geometric tiling

32
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:13,900
you can't do that with anything else and
this is our granny squares for everybody

33
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,840
who does crochet on a regular basis

34
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,099
this is actually a Lawrence manifold

35
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,750
it's not the extractor it's something
that happens to in between

36
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:35,379
it's a cut between two attractors so you
can only actually crochet that and this

37
00:03:35,379 --> 00:03:37,478
one is just because it's pretty

38
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:41,229
so is that it

39
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,220
i finished my master's degree and i
wanted to start my PhD and I wanted to

40
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,728
actually start my PhD in string theory

41
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:52,509
it was hard for me to find a PhD in
string theory

42
00:03:52,509 --> 00:04:00,040
I was in Europe mainland Europe and
there aren't many universities who are

43
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,849
doing that

44
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,439
actually the picture is wrong so this is
art this is not science because the

45
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,840
picture is wrong because strings are
actually none

46
00:04:11,469 --> 00:04:14,978
they have one dimension they are
one-dimensional so

47
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,108
swings

48
00:04:21,039 --> 00:04:27,520
string theory is the theory of physics
that tries to combine quantum mechanics

49
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,250
or quantum field theory and gravity

50
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,750
they don't like each other they are so
completely different that it's really

51
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:39,639
really hard to do that and i actually
started to study physics because i

52
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,879
wanted to do string theory because i
always was fascinated by strings so the

53
00:04:45,879 --> 00:04:52,000
thing is instead of using or instead of
calculating particles without any

54
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:59,620
dimension you use things with one
dimension and you find out that there is

55
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:01,659
a theory that makes that possible

56
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:08,229
it's in twenty six dimensional space so
you have 26 dimensional space you all up

57
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,758
22 of these dimensions and you get our
file dimensional space and you have

58
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:19,060
strings but it doesn't work you need
them to actually be closed loops

59
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:22,270
that's what the picture shows

60
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:28,960
so you have 11 dimensional strings and
you have five string theories

61
00:05:29,589 --> 00:05:33,250
that's what I learned nowadays it's
slightly different its twenty years ago

62
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:43,089
then enter II came and the one the one
conference event every string theory i

63
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:46,990
found out that everybody was talking
about mt airy and I was doing

64
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:56,469
normal string theory and that this
doesn't work so i thought my PhD and I

65
00:05:56,469 --> 00:05:58,330
did something else

66
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:07,120
I don't think i will do 20 minutes
because i think their science science is

67
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,300
cool science is not about what I want

68
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:16,599
nature to be and string theory in many
ways looks for me

69
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:24,969
like what I want nature to be there is
no not at a lot of data you can have

70
00:06:24,969 --> 00:06:26,469
without data

71
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:32,259
it's not verifiable you can actually
have a cool idea and just find a

72
00:06:32,259 --> 00:06:38,050
mathematical formulation tell everybody
that this cool idea you have is that and

73
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,990
i can write a paper

74
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:48,819
if you are at the right university it
even gets wet my back story was actually

75
00:06:48,819 --> 00:06:51,490
inspired by reading too much pressure

76
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:58,810
sometimes if you have read pressure you
probably all have and you know that he

77
00:06:58,810 --> 00:07:04,810
has the strange series how the universe
may come into existence and my theory

78
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,729
and this is not science

79
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:12,610
this is art because its storytelling my
strange idea of all sometimes when I did

80
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:17,469
string theory that there is this old
lady sitting in a rocking chair

81
00:07:18,159 --> 00:07:21,430
knitting the universe knitting strings

82
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,960
who which vibrate at special frequencies
and are our electrons neutrons protons

83
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,900
and whatever the various else

84
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:36,219
so this is a depiction of the old lady
getting our universe

85
00:07:36,219 --> 00:07:44,409
I stop my PhDs set it was for me a
little bit too much handweaving it was

86
00:07:44,409 --> 00:07:52,120
not really what I wanted to do with my
life so I looked at of things i call

87
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,249
this intermission

88
00:07:53,249 --> 00:08:01,109
I started doing games i programmed games
and during my first triple a title when

89
00:08:01,109 --> 00:08:07,019
everyone to crunch time I made a t-shirt
and i proudly often we actually gave

90
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:14,669
finished it i proudly hang it in my
office and everybody was coming and and

91
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:18,479
looking at my t-shirt that everybody
fought was crazy that I was knitting

92
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:23,489
while programming but I could
concentrate much better programming and

93
00:08:23,489 --> 00:08:30,448
debugging when my hands were actually
doing something so this was always

94
00:08:30,449 --> 00:08:38,938
something that happened for me and then
I started with something you

95
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,740
I started with music and sort of
electronic music and i started actually

96
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,470
with electronic music because i found
out that this stuff has a lot of math

97
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:57,120
and it has a lot of physics couple
strong are two guys

98
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:05,459
mr. karplus mrs. strong who had this
theory had to have to simulate a violin

99
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:11,128
not by samples but to simulate a violin
and it's pretty easy easy

100
00:09:11,129 --> 00:09:18,000
it's you put white noise or something
noisy in there and you delay it and then

101
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,059
it sounds a little bit like a violin or
a guitar

102
00:09:21,809 --> 00:09:27,540
I can demonstrate this is the part that
probably gets sound

103
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,379
that's why i asked

104
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:42,310
because this this year is sun collider

105
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:58,779
this and collider and at the moment it's
likely too small for me to read

106
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:15,779
ok

107
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:22,439
the important part is here and by the
way this is not by me

108
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:28,680
that is made by exe audio dotnet you can
find all the supercollider tutorials

109
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,939
there if you want to come if you want to
come there's tomorrow there is also

110
00:10:32,939 --> 00:10:36,329
workshops at the algorithmic tent

111
00:10:36,329 --> 00:10:42,660
I don't say this because of the app but
because here you see what it's doing

112
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:53,339
ok what is it doing you have a delay
time

113
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:59,610
any delay time is actually connected to
the pitch

114
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:03,629
so if you change the delay time you
change the pitch

115
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:13,529
so what you do is actually you take here
it's a white noise delay it make a

116
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:17,759
feedback loop and the delay time
actually gives you the pitch

117
00:11:17,759 --> 00:11:22,649
so what it does here is the first thing
it does is it calculates the delay time

118
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:29,220
yep it calculates the delay time out of
the middle pitch you give it

119
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:32,759
so how does it sound

120
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,370
this is the life coding stuff you
actually have to think okay

121
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:13,259
it doesn't come out very should come out
it comes out of my out of my laptop will

122
00:12:13,259 --> 00:12:16,649
not change that but this is how it
sounds

123
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:35,819
this is more pluck thing it sounds
slightly strange and artificial and that

124
00:12:35,819 --> 00:12:41,099
one is the bourne that's more Boeing one
but for something that simple you take

125
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,389
white noise

126
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,779
you put it into a delay filter you feel
to it slightly

127
00:12:46,319 --> 00:12:52,229
it actually sounds pretty good I have an
electronic instrument to which has this

128
00:12:52,230 --> 00:12:59,339
little bit of more sophisticated
algorithm and uses it for a cello and it

129
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,110
sounds really really good

130
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:05,279
most people can't tell if it's a gel or
if it's cello samples

131
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,610
except cellists they normally get it
pretty fast

132
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:22,439
so I started with music because of some
things like this corpus locks cup plus

133
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,079
strong algorithm because this is
actually a physical simulation

134
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:33,989
what happens and there's lots of math in
between there and with something like

135
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,160
super collider or life coding you
actually can use the math for this stuff

136
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:42,959
and I was really happy that i could use
all my stuff that I learned at

137
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:48,000
university finally to do something like
music so science to make art

138
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,740
now let's come to the last one

139
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:59,220
the tuning most people think tuning is
really simple and clear

140
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:07,560
joining is like I have 12 turns per
octave i normally use just eight of them

141
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:18,510
but we have this this chromatic scale if
12 turns we have this probably because

142
00:14:18,510 --> 00:14:23,819
our ear how it hears is with resonances
and these resonances are really really

143
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:30,029
sensible to too strong and rhythmic
stuff

144
00:14:30,029 --> 00:14:37,649
so why do we have to tuning we have we
have to tuning we have because the the

145
00:14:37,649 --> 00:14:43,920
top one is an octave which has the
proportion of two to one

146
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:55,500
so 44 is an A and 88 is an octave above
and 20 . - 220 is an octave below so we

147
00:14:55,500 --> 00:15:02,819
have this strongest of all the strongest
of all relations and if you look at it

148
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:07,229
you see when you add to sand waves that
when they are

149
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:10,589
this is simple sine waves if they are
knocked apart

150
00:15:10,589 --> 00:15:18,120
you get a periodic pattern the same
happens if you use 3 to 2 which is

151
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,089
traditionally the one we call the fifth
and you get also a periodic pattern if

152
00:15:27,089 --> 00:15:30,329
you use something that isn't this simple
number

153
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:34,679
but that is more complicated numbers
like 37 - 20

154
00:15:34,679 --> 00:15:40,529
you get this dissonance and you get a
non periodic pattern that's why we try

155
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:53,160
to use all this or photography try to
use all this beautiful whole numbers the

156
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:59,279
other one is if you look at instrument
spectra you see a violin trumpet flute

157
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,079
oboe

158
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:04,559
yeah that's all of them

159
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:09,420
you see they have a spectrum is what you
get that L that are the frequencies

160
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:12,540
if you play a note on the violin

161
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:17,459
it actually doesn't play one note it
plays many notes that are the overturns

162
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,738
the harmonics and they are spaced in a
special way and we tried to have a

163
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:32,999
tuning that gives us a maximum of this
space so that if we play two violins 44

164
00:16:32,999 --> 00:16:34,709
in a special Allah

165
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:42,988
sorry if we play to violence at a
special interval

166
00:16:42,989 --> 00:16:49,199
they actually will match the overturns
that is the second one thing we want to

167
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,939
do the problem if that is it doesn't
work

168
00:16:53,939 --> 00:16:58,019
we can't make it work it's not
mathematical it doesn't work you have

169
00:16:58,019 --> 00:17:02,759
things like the Pythagorean , you want
to have some things like the Queen

170
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:07,319
circle but you want to have everything
need and mathematically right

171
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:12,720
it doesn't work what we did is we have
to equal temperament where we use 12

172
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,980
tones

173
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:20,970
nowadays and we have the old scales
these are the red thoughts which used

174
00:17:20,970 --> 00:17:25,409
the right once and there is Wars fault
about this stuff

175
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:33,539
so what I want to say is with that stuff
is there is actually other cultures that

176
00:17:33,539 --> 00:17:37,320
use other systems for instance i think
it's very interesting that the Indian

177
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:43,889
scale the Indian octave has 22 through
teas which they use seven out of forever

178
00:17:43,890 --> 00:17:50,520
a scalar use so they have a completely
different system also i mean other

179
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:55,170
cultures have different systems in the
best in system and with electronic music

180
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,060
it's actually quite easy to just check
our system and make new ones

181
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:08,640
for instance r wilson did this
fantastical drawings of scales

182
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:17,220
you can look at them up they are all on
the net many Carlos the scale that

183
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:22,170
actually doesn't close at the octave
which is revolutionary in itself because

184
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,430
we saw that

185
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:27,570
- 21 the octave is really the strongest
one you take a string

186
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:33,720
you have it you will get a tone and
octave above and she was like no I don't

187
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,560
like that

188
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:41,820
I don't want it closed at the octave and
she used other once and then it's harry

189
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:50,850
parch use the 37 or a 43 three pitches
per octave scale which I think was very

190
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,230
interesting too

191
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,430
and he built his own instruments which
you see one of them above

192
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,950
he built his on instruments because
nothing could play them and this one is

193
00:19:01,950 --> 00:19:06,060
a marimba but most of his instruments
are strings because we've strings the

194
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:13,320
length is actually variable and you can
actually with strings play every scare

195
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,189
you want

196
00:19:14,190 --> 00:19:21,630
so a violin is actually capable of
spraying micro total scales guitars are

197
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:25,230
a little bit more problematic because
they have frets but they are friendless

198
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:26,280
guitars

199
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:31,620
you can look at youtube if you want read
less guitars guitars with special frets

200
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:37,979
so you can actually use 43 turns per
octave you can find information about

201
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:43,590
that on the hugest fucker arc side or on
the Santa Monica

202
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:49,889
wikispaces I don't like actually that
the thing about these tunings is they

203
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:56,010
are called micro kernel which I like
because we see the normal chromatic 12

204
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:56,640
turns

205
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:04,260
is one tone in between so the whites and
the blacks on the piano every one of

206
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,910
them we see as one

207
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:15,000
so C 2 C sharp C sharp to D e 2 t be
sharp and so on this is one and

208
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:19,770
microtonal means we have turns in
between the other one is an harmonic

209
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:24,300
because it's mostly used in non-western
cultures which i think is slightly you

210
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:27,240
know like it's ours is not the default

211
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:31,740
just because we use it so if if it's
okay do we have still a little bit of

212
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,430
time

213
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:37,920
I'm i have some scales on my iPad and i
would like to play some stuff for you

214
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,680
I hope this one works

215
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:53,600
yeah

216
00:21:02,570 --> 00:21:05,570
it's a plane

217
00:21:12,350 --> 00:21:15,350
can I just tried

218
00:21:27,929 --> 00:21:30,929
always for electronic music it never
works

219
00:21:34,230 --> 00:21:37,889
you get it

220
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:51,760
yeah

221
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,760
and it can you turn it up

222
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:04,250
yeah

223
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:07,250
that's an Indian scale

224
00:22:08,679 --> 00:22:14,169
they are normally the anomaly into Argus
but i don't know which one is which so i

225
00:22:14,169 --> 00:22:17,169
just took one I liked

226
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:19,660
yeah

227
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:27,580
yeah

228
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,370
yeah

229
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:36,209
yeah

230
00:22:36,790 --> 00:22:37,360
yeah

231
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:43,059
yeah

232
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,520
and you hear that sometimes actually I
played tones

233
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:52,030
sometimes we actually don't hear the
difference

234
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:56,170
that's the problem if you play with
scales like this now i use the Indian

235
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:57,340
instrument for that

236
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:05,020
that is because it sounds better now
let's hear it with jello with which i

237
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:08,020
will use for the other ones because it's

238
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:11,160
yeah

239
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,669
yeah

240
00:23:12,669 --> 00:23:14,119
hmm

241
00:23:14,119 --> 00:23:15,100
yeah

242
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,100
yeah

243
00:23:20,060 --> 00:23:21,980
yeah

244
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:24,290
yeah

245
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:27,409
yeah

246
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:38,570
so that's the indian one and now i want
to play one of the many color scales

247
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:41,570
this is colors alpha

248
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,370
yeah

249
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,370
yeah

250
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,679
yeah

251
00:23:52,679 --> 00:24:00,659
yeah

252
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:08,870
yeah

253
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,530
hmm

254
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:12,760
hmm

255
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,760
yeah

256
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,880
yeah

257
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:34,470
yeah

258
00:24:34,470 --> 00:24:37,470
yeah

259
00:24:39,450 --> 00:24:45,990
that one has 15 turns per octave and now
the last one

260
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:53,519
it's part 43 which is very difficult to
play because 43 pitches per octave you

261
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:57,750
don't have from turn to turn you
probably don't have enough difference

262
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,240
yeah

263
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,100
hmm

264
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,100
hmm

265
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,780
mmm

266
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:32,960
that was part and sometimes you hear
that

267
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,110
actually the intervals sounds very nice
because actually with the 42 e parch

268
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:48,080
make made it so that the the fifth is
actually nearer to the pure fifth then

269
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:51,080
it is in the equal temperament scale

270
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:57,080
so if you use more turns you sometimes
get nicer intervals so that was my talk

271
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:01,250
yeah i hope i showed you things

272
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,220
yeah and string
