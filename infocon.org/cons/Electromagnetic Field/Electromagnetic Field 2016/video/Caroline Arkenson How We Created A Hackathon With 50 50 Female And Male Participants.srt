1
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,308
want to hear my name is occurring

2
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,210
i'm working as an Android developer at
spotify in stock all and today I'm going

3
00:00:20,210 --> 00:00:26,060
to talk about how we created a hackathon
with 50 50 female and male participants

4
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:32,479
and how we learned to make a hackathon
for a tech event for everyone and I want

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:38,000
you guys you people to get them like
tips and tricks an inspiration to make

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,989
even better take events for all the cool
people out there who want to hack and

7
00:00:41,989 --> 00:00:43,279
learn

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,940
so back to the start when I started
working at qualified two years ago I was

9
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,729
still a student and i was working with
the student relations between spotify

10
00:00:55,729 --> 00:01:01,850
and take universities and me and my
colleagues and we were going to make an

11
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:06,979
event for students all over Sweden and
we were reflecting on why are there so

12
00:01:06,979 --> 00:01:12,289
few female students attending our
ribbons it because it's not like they

13
00:01:12,290 --> 00:01:13,460
don't exist

14
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:17,689
we just didn't manage to reach out to
them so we started thinking okay

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:25,369
how can we approach this how can we
learn how to reach out to all students

16
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:32,030
out there so we decided to we were going
to make and amazing event we were going

17
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:36,319
to force the 50-50 gender division
between the people of Maine

18
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:40,579
we also wanted to reach out to first
time hackathon owners because there are

19
00:01:40,579 --> 00:01:45,559
a lot of students out there who learn
how to code while at the university but

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,450
maybe don't and attend that many take
events because they're be scared or

21
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,430
intimidated and we wanted to say that
this is a great event for you guys and

22
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,630
and we also wanted to promote like the
nice side of the tech world like the

23
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:07,100
inspirational learning warm part of the
tech world and not just and that you

24
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:10,250
would be like sitting in a basement or
you know that kind of you we wanted to

25
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:13,459
take that that part away from it

26
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:21,440
so we decided to make diversify and we
know our motto think it's building chip

27
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,790
it show it

28
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:28,130
and so this was going to be not just a
regular hackathon it was going to be and

29
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:33,890
the hackathon focusing on creativity and
learning and building something that you

30
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:36,350
can show brothers

31
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:43,070
so this is what we decided to do for the
teams we decided that we wanted to have

32
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:48,890
40 participants because that's quite a
big crowd but it's still not too many so

33
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:54,170
you can socialize with the people there
in the room and we split up into 10

34
00:02:54,170 --> 00:03:03,589
teams so for people HT HT was going to
be 5050 female and also cross functional

35
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:09,769
so when them they applied they got to
specify what they want to do and we

36
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:15,620
didn't want a team to get stuck because
they were only have like a back in the

37
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:21,110
developers and but they want to design
and they know I want to do the design or

38
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:27,650
something like that so every team had
and each skill set they were also

39
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,350
coached by specifying please

40
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:33,620
so since these are our participants for
students

41
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,790
there are a lot of things that they
don't know maybe because they haven't

42
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:43,040
been hacking or designing that much and
we didn't want them to get stuck we

43
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,179
wanted them to get help

44
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:50,730
like really feel like they could produce
and learn something during these two

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:58,798
days and a bit about the format of the
heck out of them and how we like to

46
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,469
schedule and how we set it up so the
purpose of the first I was not to win

47
00:04:04,469 --> 00:04:07,858
we thought that everyone who were there
we're already a winner because they made

48
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:11,579
it through our screening process and and
they were like no fancy prices for

49
00:04:11,579 --> 00:04:18,900
anything so we removed the competitive
part and to instead and promote that

50
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:23,280
you're supposed to like talk to each
other and show what you built but also

51
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,799
if you're very new to programming or
going to hackathons the first thing that

52
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,639
you

53
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:35,310
the first event that you go to shouldn't
be all about like okay well I'm new and

54
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:36,180
I'm nervous

55
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:40,919
and this guy so much better than me or
you know that there has been doing this

56
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,659
for so many years and then it's just a
competition and you lose

57
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,139
and that's not very fun or so

58
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:55,020
no price is focusing on creating we also
decided to remove pitches

59
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:00,090
we didn't want our participants to spend
their time on making a slide that dick

60
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:05,010
or making an ugly hag to get that one
button that are going to show in the

61
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:08,909
presentation and to work but it actually
doesn't work at all

62
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:14,639
so we wanted them to focus on building
the product so no pitches but we had

63
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,770
like a demo stations is that so

64
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,389
each team had the table and you could go
there and you can play around with what

65
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:26,789
they build and you could ask questions
and like maybe go look into the air code

66
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:29,219
if you want to do all that's a neat
solution

67
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:33,659
no more actually focus on the product
and what they built in what they learned

68
00:05:33,659 --> 00:05:36,070
and not just doing

69
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,099
to me it's like shoulder because I mean
obviously have fun

70
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,900
how fun is it yeah not that much you
don't get that much understanding of the

71
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,669
product that they built

72
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:51,550
we also have thought if I believe very
much in and no it's sharing and so we

73
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:56,020
had in the schedule schedule we putting
like micro presentations

74
00:05:56,020 --> 00:06:00,370
every now and then just like and pass
the microphone format each team got to

75
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:03,700
say okay we've been working on this
there

76
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,229
this is our challenge right now and this
button is not working so we're trying to

77
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:09,370
figure that out

78
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:14,710
and so that everything that was there
could also know like oh but there

79
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:20,080
those people are there are building this
cool collaborate the playlist app and

80
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,609
then they are doing a travel music app
that's what so everyone knew what the

81
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:30,160
other ones were building and that but
that's so much more fun and you know

82
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,220
someone just sitting in the corner like
no this is my stuff you're not allowed

83
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,030
to see it

84
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:38,109
and so we had to promote knowledge
sharing

85
00:06:38,110 --> 00:06:44,200
we also didn't want our hacking on
participants to just sick and like code

86
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:50,830
until their eyes are bleeding or like
deal just focused in to RM on your

87
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:53,320
computer because when you're

88
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:57,370
working with this your brain kind of
needs a rest every now and then so we

89
00:06:57,370 --> 00:07:05,710
had to external speakers joining us and
Kristen human from microsoft and Heidi

90
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,380
Hartmann UX researcher from look back
and co-founder of kicker meet up

91
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:16,330
they were both there and gave a talk on
their view on diversity and also

92
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:20,409
promoting like discussion and talk to
the students

93
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,890
what do you guys think about gender
diversity and how can we approach it

94
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:30,430
because it was after all our diversity
focused event and we wanted that to show

95
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,750
as well

96
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:36,310
therefore the schedule and not just
being it like some kind of us aid and

97
00:07:36,310 --> 00:07:40,930
then people just coding but we actually
wanted the diversity approach of it to

98
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,740
show

99
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,830
we also had a workshop

100
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:49,810
so this is a duty tonight ER who works
at spotify who made them

101
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:55,180
I workshop for them and so they were
sitting like in a team of four

102
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,800
they were playing a card game then the
team would split up and go work with

103
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:06,370
another and team and do the card game
with them but the new people they were

104
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,870
playing with had another set of rules
then they had which they didn't know it

105
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:16,810
was about meeting someone replace with
the other rules of the game and handling

106
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:20,920
this communication and instead of
thinking okay this person is stupid

107
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,030
actually trying to figure out okay
what's goin on here and also another way

108
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:30,549
to have him talk to people from other
teams having a good conversation and

109
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:32,640
thinking

110
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:38,340
and the next thing that we also did
which i think is very important is sleep

111
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:42,900
so when I'm tired I don't work well at
all

112
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:49,079
something that might take me five
minutes to solve when I'm when I'm

113
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:55,950
rested might take me an hour to solve
when i'm really tired and I don't like

114
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:02,250
working at 2am in the night because then
I'm just tired I don't feel well so I

115
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,750
didn't want to promote that behavior
amongst my jacket on participants and I

116
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:15,390
wanted them to go home and get some rest
so we actually close in the evening and

117
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:20,100
we said okay and now you have to go home
and sleep for a few hours we open again

118
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,990
at nine a.m. tomorrow

119
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,100
welcome to go back for breakfast but
because i don't know how fun is safe to

120
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,250
go to an event and then on Monday
morning you're like super tired because

121
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:35,880
you didn't sleep at all or things like
that so sleep is always good always go

122
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:42,270
to sleep when you're tired so we had to
do some of my work before the event of

123
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,050
course as well because we wanted to
reach out to our participants

124
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:50,670
this is a bit how we approach to
marketing and applications and screening

125
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:57,270
that we worked with a company called
conflicting to make a sign up the site

126
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:03,150
and we had a lot of information there
and really try to make it clear that ok

127
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,819
we believe that diverse teams create the
best products at spotify we're really

128
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:14,400
trying to work for like inclusiveness
and openness and put a lot of effort

129
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,470
into this is not about winning this is
for you to learn this weekend is all

130
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,649
about you having fun

131
00:10:21,649 --> 00:10:27,920
and enjoying take and getting a nice
product that you can show and really

132
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:34,610
bounce back and forth a lot of how
should we write the text properly

133
00:10:35,689 --> 00:10:44,029
we also in the applications and we had
our participants answering a few

134
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:48,679
questions because we wanted to make sure
that we were reaching out to the right

135
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:53,480
kind of people for this event and first
modified so we wanted people who are fun

136
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:59,220
the a good team player you know a good
heart and there to learn

137
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,990
so we ask them first of all like why do
you want to be a part of diversified

138
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:09,720
just to see like okay what it is for you
and we also ask them like what area

139
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:13,589
would you like to develop further skills
things do you want to become a better

140
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:16,980
programmer do you want to learn and web
development

141
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:23,790
do you want to get the ideas on the
design tools or whatever we all stand

142
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,480
them

143
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,470
what can you contribute with because we
needed this we were setting up the teams

144
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,580
right

145
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,880
if they were like oh I really really
really want to design then we were like

146
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,170
okay that's a designer person and then
and they could make sure that we had

147
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,849
enough designers for each team

148
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:42,959
and then also and what is standard
diversity to you

149
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,520
why is it important because this was a
diversity focused event and we wanted

150
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:54,209
people to actually find this and
important the matter and not just come

151
00:11:54,209 --> 00:11:58,469
and see our offices that's what if I and
I think we did pretty well with our

152
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:03,720
outreach we had from our air
applications for the three percent

153
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,310
female

154
00:12:05,310 --> 00:12:08,430
applicants and fifty-seven percent mail

155
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:14,579
we never had that many female students
applying to enter our events before so

156
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:21,000
that was a good win for us we managed to
reach out to a lot of famous even has a

157
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,400
lot of first-time hackathon honors

158
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:28,949
so what other good things when you're
organizing hacking phones

159
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:34,380
ok food food is really important for
energy and happiness

160
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:41,880
a lot of taken out there they serve
pizza and beer enough everyone likes

161
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,810
pizza and beer

162
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:49,199
me for example I'm gluten intolerant I
can't even eat pizza or drink beer and

163
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,270
when I went to a tech event earlier this
year I got potato chips for breakfast

164
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:58,980
and that's not a great start of my name
so we didn't have pizza and beer because

165
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:04,680
some people like that but we also make
sure to have salads and sewed us and

166
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:09,750
maybe cider or and donuts for those who
want donuts but also apples and the

167
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:16,020
carrots takes or croissant look like
you're really making sure that everyone

168
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,160
there was something for everyone to eat
and you know you shouldn't have to go

169
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,850
hungry you need you know your brain
needs fuel when you were working on

170
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:26,940
things that's really important

171
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:32,670
another like nice thing like a nice
touch and that we had is like soundtrack

172
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:39,300
your hacked in the applications we left
the people like feeling

173
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:44,310
what song are you and why because it's
pretty fun way to get to know someone

174
00:13:44,310 --> 00:13:48,079
like see what different songs people
choose and

175
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:53,630
how they explain themselves with this
song before the heck i found we made a

176
00:13:53,630 --> 00:13:59,390
playlist with the other 40 participants
and you're like hey and this is all of

177
00:13:59,390 --> 00:13:59,960
you

178
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:04,580
this is a fun way for you to get to know
a shower and you know who get excited

179
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:10,130
about the hack before beforehand and
then during the hackathon we opened up

180
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,870
the playlist so we made it

181
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,470
collaborate date so everyone could add
the music they wanted to listen to

182
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:19,220
which means that there was always
something that you would like that will

183
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:22,700
be playing in the speaker's because
music is there

184
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:26,990
you know at least to me very important
and it's a great a very nice atmosphere

185
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,420
and this way we can also make sure that
you know if you at least just like one

186
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:38,300
song in a playlist is going to play for
you ever not want them so we evaluated

187
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:43,520
this a bit afterwards and we got some
nice feedback like first time I worked

188
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,650
in a team as balanced as this one

189
00:14:45,650 --> 00:14:49,819
you know when they had both designers
and back and front and no way people and

190
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,110
thought it was great to skip the
competition part because the event felt

191
00:14:54,110 --> 00:14:57,740
really relaxed and people could mingle
around and look at everyone stuff which

192
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,970
is great this really you know what we
wanted to promote and they really liked

193
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:03,939
having a coach and

194
00:15:03,939 --> 00:15:09,009
it was an employee like and they said
that it was awesome getting feedback

195
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:14,470
from real people in the best because a
student is pretty difficult to know what

196
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:17,949
is it like to actually work as a
developer or as a designer but now they

197
00:15:17,949 --> 00:15:20,949
could get like the real tips and tricks

198
00:15:21,939 --> 00:15:26,108
so I said that this is a proof of
concept how good diversity within the 18

199
00:15:26,109 --> 00:15:29,829
because they built a really cool stuff
like I'm jealous of the products that

200
00:15:29,829 --> 00:15:33,399
they built during these two days and
someone said that it's the most

201
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,139
inspiring weekend in a long time

202
00:15:35,139 --> 00:15:39,220
I'm so happy that we managed to inspire
people and make them feel like wow this

203
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,239
is amazing i want to continue doing this
and then they said this code that i

204
00:15:43,239 --> 00:15:47,859
really love someone when they ask them
to explain your weekend in one sentence

205
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:51,549
and one person says adventures happen if
you let them

206
00:15:52,329 --> 00:15:55,809
so we made that take event and this
person saw this like that

207
00:15:55,809 --> 00:16:00,999
it's a great adventure and that's
awesome okay but are you thinking

208
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:05,949
ok cool Caroline but not everything can
be as awesome as jumping into a pool out

209
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:07,179
from the window right

210
00:16:07,179 --> 00:16:12,879
no that's true there were some
improvements we could do and so a few

211
00:16:12,879 --> 00:16:17,470
months later we made another hackathon
that we called unified which was more

212
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:24,489
about and collaborating and working in a
big team so they we put them up in and

213
00:16:24,489 --> 00:16:30,549
teams of eight and we did the same thing
here like application we assemble the

214
00:16:30,549 --> 00:16:35,589
team for them things like that but we
did some changes to improve this further

215
00:16:35,589 --> 00:16:40,149
and first of all we didn't want to force
the 50-50

216
00:16:40,149 --> 00:16:40,800
gender

217
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,750
split we wanted to see like did we
really learned something from diversify

218
00:16:45,750 --> 00:16:50,940
like in terms of marketing and
information and then stuck with it

219
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:57,630
we got a generous plate both in
applications and four for the hackathon

220
00:16:57,630 --> 00:17:02,760
in forty percent female and sixty
percent mail which is great I mean the

221
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:09,420
tech world isn't 5050 but this is still
pretty balanced and compared to if we

222
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,990
would have ten percent female and ninety
percent name

223
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:18,870
we also made the teams like
platform-specific because while and they

224
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:23,188
did enjoy the diversified that they
could say i want to do the sign or I

225
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:27,839
want to do a back end or I want to do
front then some participants felt that

226
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:34,710
ok i really wanted to and do iOS
development but my team they wanted to

227
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:39,840
do web because they hadn't done by us
before and this is a bit of machine

228
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,110
so here we also let that pretty epic

229
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:47,790
applicants say like okay I want to do is
I want to do web or I wanted to android

230
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:53,460
so we had like two web teams we had one
Android team and one is team and that

231
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:58,440
way we make sure that if you like a
back-end you could do back in but then

232
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:02,970
you would also work on the platform that
you want to work on and then we also

233
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,980
combine the demos that we had with
presentations on stage first because

234
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:11,490
even though that memo format was great

235
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:16,559
some participants felt that they had to
repeat themselves over and over again

236
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:19,760
you know I would show something to a
person here then

237
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:24,560
I would explain this app and as you type
in the city and then you get the artist

238
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:25,460
up there

239
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:29,420
that's playing the next week and then
you know next person would come and i

240
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,700
would have to say the same thing riggan

241
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:35,810
so in and said we had first like
presentations and stay just like show

242
00:18:35,810 --> 00:18:41,149
your product and this is what they
learned this is what we built and then

243
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:44,390
that's where everyone could see it once
and then you can go around and play at

244
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:54,830
their demonstrations that was all i was
going to say now if you want to go ahead

245
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:59,990
and look at what they built their doing
these to hackathons we have to showcase

246
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,900
sites they called the or diversified
that getup that i owe or Spotify that

247
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:12,530
unified at github that i owe as pretty
cool you can see what they built if you

248
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,690
want to reach out to me

249
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,890
