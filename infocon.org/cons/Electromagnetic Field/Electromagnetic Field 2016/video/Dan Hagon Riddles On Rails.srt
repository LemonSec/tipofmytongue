1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:14,849
so s show of hands first of all can you
hear me

2
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,400
good

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,538
question who here is a fan of trains and
railways

4
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:25,610
yep and who here is a fan of computers
yep same number of roughly similar and

5
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:29,840
so how many of you have thought about if
there's a connection between these two

6
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:30,710
things

7
00:00:30,710 --> 00:00:34,550
well if you have done as some have a
great great great then you are in the

8
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:35,540
right place

9
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:40,910
so this is my talk riddles on rails and
my name is Dan hagen and it's gonna be

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:43,940
fairly far fast-paced talk so we're
gonna start off talking a little bit

11
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:48,830
about safety so safety of computer
safety for railways and then we're

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:51,110
getting is going to get a little bit
weird for a little while but stick with

13
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:54,680
it because at the end we're going to go
and look at some fun puzzles and games

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,710
so just a little bit about me so I
design a wireless control system is a

15
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,860
battery powered system for model
railways and I've been coming to hack

16
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:12,439
apps now since 2011 or so and it was
kind of a a surprise to me when I kind

17
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,149
of looked at the history of so hacking
and a half culture that the original

18
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,080
hackers the people that actually call
themselves a hacker's originally were

19
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:25,670
actually model railway enthusiasts so
that you can still read about in Stephen

20
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,140
ladies book here

21
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:32,600
it's called the technical railroad club
still exists mit they were really really

22
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,750
interest into using computers to control
them all the railways basically so let's

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:47,090
talk first of all about how we how many
safety but not to safety for railways

24
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:51,440
but also for computers and actually
there's a very strong relationship

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,640
between the two so i won't take it back
now -

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:04,130
at eighteen sixty-one and imagine it's
sort of a bank holiday weekend

27
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:09,919
people have been to go visit the
pavilions very nice place in Bryson to

28
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:13,849
visit and so lots of people are going to
get down there

29
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:19,730
train her trains and go home into London
or wherever and so just outside of

30
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:25,730
brighton there is a tunnel is called the
plate internal is quite an ornate tunnel

31
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:28,179
as most victorious or buildings are

32
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:34,269
and on this particular morning there
were three trains that were leave due to

33
00:02:34,269 --> 00:02:34,780
leave

34
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,049
and as it is whether on one of these
sort of busy mornings

35
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:42,640
they all were sort of very late to leave
and so they left at you with a very

36
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,809
short succession and at the time they
were using sort of time intervals to

37
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:54,489
just gonna buy it so that you can see
sorry the timings that of the departures

38
00:02:54,489 --> 00:02:59,109
now they're using time intervals to to
leave at two to make sure where the

39
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,669
trains go on

40
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,939
you know don't send the next one until
you've got enough time between between

41
00:03:03,939 --> 00:03:09,939
it ok so let's have a look at the tunnel
itself so that the tunnel you have in

42
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:13,269
the tunnel itself actually you can't
quite see all the way through the tunnel

43
00:03:13,269 --> 00:03:17,859
has a slight kink at the end of it so
they have to have a signaler at each end

44
00:03:17,859 --> 00:03:18,669
of the tunnel

45
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:26,290
ok and and so the they basically ensure
entry and exit of the tunnel and out at

46
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:31,150
the entrance of the south side as you
can see here there was a ball basically

47
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:36,909
it and it rose up to indicate that the
train could proceed and then it was

48
00:03:36,909 --> 00:03:40,239
dropped to to indicate that

49
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:45,549
well what want to try to come past it
was dropped automatically

50
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:49,030
ok so let's just reset that and see what
happened in this particular incident

51
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:57,310
so our first train goes past ok and then
the signaler on the south side signals

52
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:00,639
to the north side and says the train
isn't now in the tunnel

53
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,729
ok nothing wrong with that but then he
notices something about the balls that

54
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:04,780
ball hasn't dropped

55
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,340
ok so that's us our first of failure
that happened and a mechanical failure

56
00:04:09,909 --> 00:04:16,478
ok so what he does then he rushes out
with his flag ok any he's not quite

57
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,130
quick enough because the next train is
coming

58
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:23,139
very short shortly after she's not quite
quick and be not quite sure that second

59
00:04:23,139 --> 00:04:24,580
train seen that flag

60
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,409
ok but he's quick enough to actually
stop the third train that comes along

61
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,900
and then he can

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:37,120
well he has it has a choice now does he
send this this the train into the tunnel

63
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,440
or does he does he wait so what he
doesn't he sends a mess

64
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,830
wish to the other signal and says is the
tunnel clear

65
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:50,890
ok now just at that moment the first
train that went into the tunnel exit the

66
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:51,550
tunnel

67
00:04:51,550 --> 00:04:55,570
ok now that north side singular

68
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:59,530
now tell us the other singer fire
development of telegraph system

69
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:05,740
he says yeah yeah the tunnels clear
however I think you probably guess what

70
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:10,090
was going to happen here that second
train is still in the tunnel and that

71
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:16,239
second train not notice that flag was
there and he actually decides to reverse

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,740
here that is also a failure that he
should have thought you know he should

73
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,110
have thought about the consequences of
that

74
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:29,620
so there what happens is fairly obvious
that the two trains collide when

75
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:30,940
reversing into the other

76
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,420
actually it's one of the most sort of
disastrous

77
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,710
relax it's actually sort of the real
history in the UK real history

78
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:45,430
I'm going to turn three people actually
died in that particular instant that is

79
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:49,480
that the thing about it is there are
lots and lots of different ways you

80
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:52,930
could actually correct this you can
think about where the failure happened

81
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:53,440
with this

82
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:58,210
ok so i'll leave that with you too can
think about where you would correct

83
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:00,580
though the the the protocol is going on
there

84
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,570
ok so let's have a look at more and more
modern way of doing signaling

85
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:09,640
so if it's gonna get so there's a link
here for

86
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,640
if you're interested more this is lots
and lots of data on this particular site

87
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,539
that tells you about other accidents and
why they could and various things that

88
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:20,590
anyway so let's think about in a station

89
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:25,270
so a signaler the signal box in the
station can see the whole of the station

90
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:30,400
and you can basically he or she can
basically look at that look at all the

91
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,630
trains are there and determine whether
or not they're going to Clyde and and so

92
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,270
it's the points appropriately when you
get to a tunnel

93
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,390
the situation is different you know
basically as we've seen you can't see

94
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,110
through the tunnel and so you have to
have a principle that we use to ensure

95
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:46,360
that trains to collide

96
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:52,840
ok so so we've got two stations & B and
we we use what's known as the absolute

97
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,859
blocks is

98
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:57,879
and so we make sure we actually make
sure that there is only have a one train

99
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,590
in that block section

100
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:04,060
ok ok so how do we do this well station

101
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:08,800
the signification be basically has
control over the line

102
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:15,909
that's that preceded it and singular
sensation a has to request permission

103
00:07:15,909 --> 00:07:17,860
for trains to come into that section

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:21,669
ok and how they do that well as we've
seen this and there's a telegraph system

105
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:25,990
between them to what the color-block
instrument as you can see here and

106
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,889
various sort of protocols for their
spells they used to say whether or not

107
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:33,310
there's a request to come into the
section and whether something is clear

108
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,539
the section so on

109
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:42,969
ok so then happened what does the stairs
the train driver the injured driver see

110
00:07:42,969 --> 00:07:46,599
so I at the entrance of the section
you've got signal

111
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:49,960
and so she called a starter and fairly
obvious reasons and you also have

112
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,948
another signal at the exit to the block
called the home when you get home

113
00:07:53,949 --> 00:07:54,789
basically

114
00:07:54,789 --> 00:07:58,930
and we can see what they look like now
notice something about the weather that

115
00:07:58,930 --> 00:08:07,750
they are designed so basically the the
arm is raised for the proceed aspect but

116
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,190
if it fails for instance then it will
fail in the failsafe mode

117
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,529
ok so that's kind of what's called upper
quadrant and the signal and knows the

118
00:08:17,529 --> 00:08:20,770
train has left the section because you
can see here at the end of the train

119
00:08:20,770 --> 00:08:25,389
there is a red light is really important
if the train brakes halfway through then

120
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:28,779
that if he doesn't see that red light
and you know it's not to allow another

121
00:08:28,779 --> 00:08:30,099
train into that section

122
00:08:30,099 --> 00:08:37,958
ok so we're going to seen how the the
railway operates and ensures safe

123
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,429
operation from collision

124
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,789
how can we apply this to software

125
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:47,170
so here are two processes that are
basically running infinite loops and

126
00:08:47,170 --> 00:08:52,089
they have two different sections so they
have a critical section and they have a

127
00:08:52,089 --> 00:08:57,190
non-critical section and then protecting
the entry and exit from that critical

128
00:08:57,190 --> 00:09:00,310
section or two primitives called signal
and white

129
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:04,270
ok so very very similar to the sort of
block section that we've seen with the

130
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,569
with the railway

131
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:10,490
ok i am now this was this was actually
designed by a Dutch could be scientists

132
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,290
call that ed that's good

133
00:09:12,290 --> 00:09:18,079
Dykstra and and he actually used the the
name of the original use weren't a

134
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,680
signal and white but P and V and they

135
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:28,400
i'm told us and for equivalent concepts
from directly taken from the railway

136
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:34,160
analogy essentially and so you are
semaphore in this case a similar to the

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:42,560
signal allows entry and exit to the
critical section that is just a am an

138
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:49,280
integer so basically at the . the
instant become zero a another process

139
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:55,430
can can take or gain entry to that
critical section and this basically the

140
00:09:55,430 --> 00:10:00,050
critical section means that only one
process is executing that which means if

141
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:03,050
you if you got a shared memory at region

142
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:07,760
the only one process can read or write
to it so that ensures consistency as you

143
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:11,750
can imagine some is just read from a
memory area and they try to read from it

144
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,650
immediately

145
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:15,709
sony something else transfer me to read
from it a read

146
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:20,570
immediately what will happen is that
they will have inconsistent views of

147
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:21,350
that data

148
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:27,350
ok so that some force now let's look at
a another kind of safety issue what

149
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:34,670
we're discussing there was kind of
safety from a sort of policy level but

150
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:37,969
this is more about say a sort of what

151
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,130
what does the the kind of human operator
do in the system ok so that the trolley

152
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:48,050
problem basically so imagine this a
trolley this with barreling down the

153
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,599
tracks and it's out of control okay

154
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,750
and then there's some people on the
tracks now quite explain why they're on

155
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,060
the tracks but bear with it for now

156
00:10:56,060 --> 00:11:00,709
ok am and ok so you you then have
control of a point

157
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:04,940
ok and so it's a fairly easy decision to
make you pull that . except of course

158
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:08,510
there's always a catch there's somebody
else on the other track

159
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,170
there's only one personal about other
track so they're the kind of the

160
00:11:12,170 --> 00:11:14,209
decision process here as well

161
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,630
what's what you do do you have to say
well if I wasn't here

162
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,779
and that train was just coming down that
track anyway

163
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:26,399
well you know that those five people
would be killed right so I that if I

164
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:31,709
wasn't here that would happen anyway so
if I just leave the the the handle is

165
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:36,479
the same thing or is it ok and then the
other thing is if I pull the handle

166
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:41,339
I've definitely I mean I've made that
conscious decision that one person is it

167
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:45,029
is going to be killed and that was my
actions done that ok so so I mean

168
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:48,870
there's no there's no right answer to
this but it is one of these problems

169
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:53,339
which has been sort of a moral
philosophy roll ethics and philosophy

170
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,730
and the rest of it has at it it has kind
of create a lot of interesting and the

171
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:04,320
bait basically so I was kind of curious
actually this idea of our people and

172
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,820
people on tracks and it being a sort of
the sort of tropes that you get I mean

173
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,029
think of silent movies but actually it
kind of goes back a lot further actually

174
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:18,120
goes back to a play by a guy called
focused in daily sort of Victorian

175
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,020
melodrama and they truly problem itself
is sort of a sixties problem will you

176
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:26,610
sit crop up in sort of internet memes
and lots of like quantum mechanics based

177
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,300
ones anyway

178
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:34,109
and yeah and so basically there's this
there's lots of variations on on this on

179
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,390
this idea where does it get application

180
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:41,040
well autonomous vehicles you think about
AI in autonomous vehicles right

181
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:48,089
so at some stage that vehicle has got to
make a decision do I swerve you two to

182
00:12:48,089 --> 00:12:54,029
not hit a group of two pedestrians but
what then happens to the passengers in

183
00:12:54,029 --> 00:12:54,480
my car

184
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,839
ok so so this this is kind of our
patients

185
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,410
of course you could have you could of
course but the vehicle on some rails and

186
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:06,000
make it a bit safer that way but anyway
that will you say is the way to do it

187
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,029
ok so all right so now it's gonna get a
little bit weird so we're going to talk

188
00:13:09,029 --> 00:13:10,410
about time so time

189
00:13:10,410 --> 00:13:14,490
well let's look at this clock here what
what can you notice about it has has 2

190
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,610
minute hands minute arms okay so this
clock is off the side of the corn

191
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,959
exchange in bristol

192
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:27,420
okay and these two a minute arms are
there because one is for london time and

193
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:31,260
one is for Bristol's time now this is a
time where all over the country every

194
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:34,050
when setting the clock by the Sun
basically so it was completely

195
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:38,219
inconsistent timing amongst all the
different locations so it's complete

196
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:42,840
chaos basically you have things like
people would make that watch you run a

197
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:48,030
bit faster when they're going from east
to west vs or slower about earlier and

198
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:50,250
what's up one of those wave around
anyway

199
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,940
and so they correct for these these
timings and you know you can imagine all

200
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:59,340
sorts of things are accidents and people
just missing trains so they had to

201
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,030
figure out a way of getting around this
so what they came up with was a time

202
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,339
distribution system knows the conifer

203
00:14:05,340 --> 00:14:11,640
so basically this ran along the
Telegraph wise and so you're using the

204
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,449
pre-existing telegraph wires for
signaling and so forth and it basically

205
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:22,080
it base became known as well we time as
a result of this actually but it was

206
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,230
used for more than just run away at
timings

207
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:30,990
ok so this is a schematic of the of the
time we see each other , first system

208
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,270
itself so you can see on the top

209
00:14:33,270 --> 00:14:36,870
what is it on your side on the top left
hand side you can see the incoming

210
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:38,430
signal coming from Greenwich

211
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:43,079
ok this is the greenwich mean time and
then there are five I believe signals

212
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:46,560
going out to various locations and you
can see the relays in the batteries at

213
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,060
the bottom ok so this is this time
signal was sent at ten a.m. every day so

214
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:54,540
they had to clear that I mean that the
telegraph wires be used for normal

215
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:59,640
traffic but they had to clear that line
at ten a.m. every day to make sure that

216
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:01,500
they got this time signature coming
through

217
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:06,780
I'm reliably informed even up to the
sixties is still being used and so yeah

218
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:09,720
basically though they'd listen out for
this time signature and then they'd

219
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:14,370
relay this time signature out too many
many other locations ok just dripping

220
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,170
out now

221
00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:19,560
we actually have a very similar
situation actually in computing so we

222
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,819
got in there is the network time
protocol and you can see the sort of the

223
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:27,060
tree like structure so you can see it
being distributed from a sort of

224
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:31,589
essentially as a central source so you
have multiple what they call straw some

225
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:36,870
0 clocks and very strong 2 1 2 3 and so
so in the in the UK for instance we got

226
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,910
the National Physical directory

227
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:44,969
and in the long term camp here we have
to have a couple of time service as well

228
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:50,640
so basically you can see very similar
kind of principles being used here

229
00:15:51,270 --> 00:15:57,990
so how do we actually use this to
synchronize our clocks well basically

230
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:02,220
timestamp messages will be sent and
received between two different servers

231
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:07,800
and you use that to determine various
things that offset drift and so forth

232
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,760
and something known as Mozilla's out
with more slight variation on that is

233
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,900
used to combine time signatures from
multiple clock so basically two to get

234
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:27,630
rid of outliers as a mother were ok so
that was that that was sort of from the

235
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:29,160
19th century

236
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,819
view of time which we can also use today
actually

237
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:38,790
but back in the early 20th century and
Chapel Einstein came along and he

238
00:16:38,790 --> 00:16:43,650
thought a lot of that time time is kind
of important so he has a very sorts of

239
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:48,449
experiments and one of them involves to
train now he he envisaged somebody on a

240
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:53,760
train with a stone or peril or whatever
and they throw that pebble and it hits

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,930
the embankment

242
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:58,170
ok now to the person on the train

243
00:16:58,170 --> 00:17:03,089
the the the pebble is basically I mean
they throw that they did they let go of

244
00:17:03,090 --> 00:17:07,530
it so it through gravity the the the
pebbles just going vertically down from

245
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,460
their perspective

246
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:12,660
ok so to the person on the embankment
though they're saying is a parabola

247
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,619
ok so as they asked question basically
what which is the true what the one true

248
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:26,129
path this this this purple is the stone
is taking and so he thinks through and

249
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:31,350
basically its conclusion is there isn't
actually a 12 part so there is a part of

250
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:35,669
a to these what what's known as these
reference frames of reference frame

251
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:40,590
basically has of move on our move on to
the next

252
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:50,070
we go so if i am to basically every
reference frame the the the laws of

253
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:55,169
physics within each reference frame are
the same so there's no there's no sort

254
00:17:55,170 --> 00:18:00,000
of special reference frame so a lot of
people look at this problem i thinkwell

255
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,160
obviously that the bank is is you know
bolted to the to the earth it's it's

256
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,210
it's there

257
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:09,690
you know the one to reference frame and
everything else is relative to that but

258
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,750
his conclusion is know that all these
different reference frames are are

259
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:20,010
equally their own particular reference
frame and one particular part of this is

260
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:24,210
that the speed of light in each
reference frame is the same

261
00:18:24,210 --> 00:18:28,830
ok so we'll leave that in there in in
just a second ok so how does he use this

262
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:35,250
then to think about time well he
imagines lightning striking either end

263
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,090
of the training

264
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:40,230
okay - yeah I guess he says hitting the
rails but it's the same thing eating the

265
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:41,280
train effectively

266
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,320
ok so he's asking the question are these
events simultaneous ok do these events

267
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,570
occur at exactly the same time

268
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:54,179
ok and in particular to the ink occur
for this at the same time for this

269
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:57,720
person stood on the bank of the
immaculate as for the person stood on

270
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:58,560
the train

271
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:04,350
ok so basically that's think about the
person embankment so that person is this

272
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:05,490
imagine them

273
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:09,900
midway between the two locations okay so
we know the speed of light is the same

274
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:14,070
in in that reference frame is any other
reference frame so he's suspicious

275
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:19,379
shit them season in them in the middle
of that the the two lightning strikes

276
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,180
and the light clearly is going to take
the same amount of time to reach her

277
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:29,430
basically because it's got its got the
same distance to travel so for her if

278
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:33,480
she sees those as a simultaneous if they
do if they really are simultaneously in

279
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,190
have her reference frame then that then
she's basically you know that they're

280
00:19:38,190 --> 00:19:41,820
going to arrive at the same time because
they go to they had to traverse the same

281
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:48,629
distance and so basically we can use
this principle 24 be given reference

282
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,350
frame to say well all these clocks
within that reference frame all

283
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:54,590
synchronized ok we can look at the pic

284
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:58,668
- in the hands and we can see all these
these hands are pointing to the same

285
00:19:58,669 --> 00:19:59,750
position

286
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:04,820
ok now let's think about the other
reference frame the frame that's within

287
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,189
the the train is going along

288
00:20:07,190 --> 00:20:14,360
ok so basically if you consider the past
the midpoint along the train so that

289
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:21,020
that basically when the when the
lightning strikes occur that is that is

290
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:27,440
the same as the midpoint for the
embankment frame but crucially it's

291
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,360
moving along

292
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,399
it's moving relative to the the
embankment so actually the the light

293
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,539
that's coming along the train from
behind and the light that's coming from

294
00:20:38,539 --> 00:20:44,029
in front will take different amounts of
time to reach that person because by the

295
00:20:44,029 --> 00:20:47,029
time that person has got further on the
track

296
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,049
you know the time of the lights reach
them they they've got further on the

297
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:56,990
track and there's less time it takes for
that like to get to them from in front

298
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:58,490
of them then it was behind them

299
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:03,980
ok so there's a really really profound
conclusion for this right which is that

300
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:09,620
actually to say that events are
simultaneous a you cannot say that

301
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:13,520
unless you say they are simultaneous in
this frame of reference

302
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:18,770
ok that's a really really crucial
conclusion from its own special

303
00:21:18,770 --> 00:21:19,789
relativity

304
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:23,480
ok so you might think we're okay this is
that is very a steric and it doesn't

305
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,679
really apply to every day kind of things
you have speed of light in the rest of

306
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:27,980
it

307
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:34,399
well actually gps if you didn't correct
for special and general relativity

308
00:21:34,399 --> 00:21:36,590
within a day

309
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,480
you basically that they that your
position would drift so far they would

310
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,250
it would be next to useless

311
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:49,279
ok and so that's an everyday kind of a
usage of you know these principles but

312
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:50,630
even on a network

313
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:57,679
we've got sort of the differential time
through the networking from blazing and

314
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,960
buffers and different line speeds and so
on and so forth so within

315
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:09,740
the distributed system it the different
times different events occur at

316
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:13,010
different times and you can't really
sort of have a consistent view of of

317
00:22:13,010 --> 00:22:18,140
timing and also you could have someone
that purposefully says well this thing

318
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,030
occurred at that time or something along
the way can can-can maliciously change

319
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:27,410
time stamps and so forth so and it's a
when you start thinking about it

320
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:32,120
time in distributed systems on the
network is actually a very slim . kind

321
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:36,199
of concept her to kind of deal with and
some people have looked at this

322
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:41,690
I'm one of the concepts that come up
with this and was a logical clocks or

323
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:46,400
Lamport time and time stamps or a lamp
or clocks

324
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,080
so basically for we got three processes
here and look at the middle one here

325
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,710
we've got various events that occur
within a process

326
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:58,880
ok and it's fairly easy to work out that
they will occur in time order as there's

327
00:22:58,880 --> 00:22:59,720
no problem there

328
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,010
now when we send a message between two
different processes well I think we'll

329
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:07,220
all agree that message is sent before
it's received

330
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:11,060
so then we got some time ordering there
ok so what we got what we have then is

331
00:23:11,060 --> 00:23:15,080
what's known as a a partial order so
there are some events for instance these

332
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,889
two here which we can't actually say
well that would occur before that one or

333
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:20,810
the same time as that one and so forth

334
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:26,179
ok so it's it's a slightly weaker kind
of a nation of ordering and events in in

335
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:29,360
the system and so variations on this
theme

336
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,300
what's in use at the moment for our
timing with in distributed systems so

337
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,190
because that was that was the the kind
of weird stuff for that the way

338
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:44,330
now i'm gonna skip one slide there and
I'm going to talk i'm doing the talking

339
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,879
about and i will come back to the other
side by the way i'm going to talk about

340
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:50,900
shunting yard

341
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,370
ok and the basically you could get there
there's a kind of puzzle that could

342
00:23:58,370 --> 00:24:00,679
known as the shunting up as well there's
lots and lots of business

343
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,620
this is one example is kind of most
famous example so this when you have

344
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:11,719
basically you got a hunter and they have
eight wagons coaches there it giving

345
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,430
numbers and you have to

346
00:24:13,430 --> 00:24:19,460
what basically you've got different
capacities on the two sightings of

347
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:23,480
tricks or three sightings and on the
spur of the top to have three the bottom

348
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:29,480
one has five and spur has 41 days for
the center and so basically go to sent

349
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:32,810
them you know just using their that the
rails that you got there basically

350
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,750
you've got a shunt the the wagons so you
get the vikings in the correct order a

351
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:39,680
125

352
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,290
it's a fun kind of puzzle is lots of
variations on this thing but you might

353
00:24:45,290 --> 00:24:50,060
notice a kind of similarity here with a
a puzzle that's kind of very often used

354
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,950
in there

355
00:24:51,950 --> 00:24:57,200
no early programming kind of teaching
and things like that

356
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:02,390
it's not quite the same possible to
reverse very similar little at and I

357
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:06,650
said there's also some other variations
on this thing and so we've we can also

358
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:13,790
look think about shunting yards in terms
of a basically a grammar so that you can

359
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:18,050
to generate a language and you a grammar
to say how you compose the various

360
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:20,210
elements that are you at all

361
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:24,710
the the parts that make up words in that
language

362
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:33,139
ok so normally you use something like a
pack is now form but this type of

363
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:36,140
diagram is actually quite very very
least you should be more commonly use

364
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:40,760
but not so much these days and Prince
Pascal used to use is a a wave of

365
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:45,080
defining that their language but is this
is exactly the the context-free

366
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:50,480
languages is that you get with BNF form
and so how do we use it so they can you

367
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,860
let me give you an example

368
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,479
oh by the way this one comes from the
JSON specifications are making sure that

369
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:01,490
you are kind of fairly familiar with
this and then again so exact one example

370
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:06,440
of this so this are defining floating
point number so i got one here which I

371
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,150
can't quite remember dates

372
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:11,390
well anyway that that number there
whichever one it thinks there

373
00:26:11,390 --> 00:26:18,080
- 0.24 has has the following you you
trace it through this path basically to

374
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:22,580
get to get into to define that

375
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:26,269
number in that in that grammar so let me
give you as a slightly more complicated

376
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:28,669
example that takes a different pass
through that

377
00:26:28,669 --> 00:26:35,390
ok so that's how we did how we define
that that that that particular number so

378
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:37,130
this

379
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,130
there's think about now so I up

380
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:44,090
I want to go into different direction so
i can i can define this the sort of

381
00:26:44,090 --> 00:26:48,379
strings in my grandma and my language
using the grammar but maybe I want to

382
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:54,409
take a string and I wanted the composer
and actually evaluate it ok so first of

383
00:26:54,409 --> 00:27:00,529
all let's define a grammar that we can
use to to do that that operation so

384
00:27:00,529 --> 00:27:05,809
we're going to do something based on a
single digit arithmetic expressions

385
00:27:05,809 --> 00:27:09,049
you'll notice this one doesn't think
that motion yards can't do which is it's

386
00:27:09,049 --> 00:27:14,360
recursive so they can take this entire
diagram and place it in each of the two

387
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:19,490
expressions either side of the the
operator in the middle

388
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:26,720
ok so that's giving an example from this
ok so so this this example is i put the

389
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,000
numbers in in order that will be
important

390
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:33,260
a little bit later on so this example we
can't directly evaluate this will

391
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:37,820
complete account directly evaluate is
this is no it's not not easy for it to

392
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,279
to do so but there is a form known as
reverse polish notation we might also

393
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,590
know this is as postfix notation the one
of the top is actually in fix notation

394
00:27:48,590 --> 00:27:55,129
and this is actually a an easier form to
to evaluate because you can basically

395
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:55,850
take them

396
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,510
the numbers and the operators in the
order they come so for instance will

397
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:03,200
will have a stack and we'll push our
first value on the stack and then we'll

398
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,539
take our next value pushed onto the
stack and then we'll take our operator

399
00:28:08,539 --> 00:28:15,679
and then we'll combine two top values on
the stack to at creating the new value

400
00:28:15,679 --> 00:28:20,960
and then push that back onto the stack
and so then we can do this and many

401
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,929
times over and then we evaluated the
whole expression and kisses - okay so so

402
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:31,580
so we got a problem here that we've got
a an expression in infix notation want

403
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:34,399
to get into a postfix notation

404
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,910
ok so in order to do that we use
something up

405
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:41,090
yes I mean it would be nice if we need a
way of doing that ok

406
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,040
and notice one thing first of all the
numbers when we convert between them are

407
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:46,940
in the same order

408
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:50,810
ok but sometimes the operators are in
different order so we're going to do

409
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:54,830
some sort of literally we can do some
hunting to get them into the right order

410
00:28:54,830 --> 00:29:00,199
because how do we do that well again and
this is coming from to this this comes

411
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,540
from Dykstra and basically his his
mechanism of doing this

412
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:08,870
basically users are shutting up so let
me quickly go through this

413
00:29:08,870 --> 00:29:16,129
we sent our operators across to the
deciding and then by doing so

414
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,300
oops I think so we can get into the
right format

415
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:28,190
ok I'm and then just final thing about
at Dykstra he he is very famous for this

416
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:29,900
thing called the doctors algorithm

417
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:37,070
turns out that it in the UK people
working on the UK rail network back in

418
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:40,879
the fifties came up with the algorithm
just again two or three years but prior

419
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,890
to him and that that is very first sort
of firm fascinating kind of story and I

420
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,480
a GT car but I look more into that but
and you know certainly a lot of these

421
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,370
things crop up now again yet

422
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,929
now i think i've run out a time there
were a couple of videos here but i shall

423
00:29:56,930 --> 00:30:00,410
i shall haue and now i think

424
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:12,230
hey yeah we very a gap first person the
other will do this one here

425
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:15,320
ok and that

426
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:27,380
yeah

427
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:39,820
yeah

428
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,820
thank you

429
00:30:45,910 --> 00:30:50,560
so this is this isn't just a little a
little puzzle here so yeah you might

430
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:56,800
notice that that the the the the tracks
in this particular orientation they look

431
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:59,649
like they're different lengths but i can
show you they're exactly the same length

432
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:04,180
right so go get some track and try and
figure out why that's the case and but i

433
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:06,250
think i think that's the end ok thank
you so much
