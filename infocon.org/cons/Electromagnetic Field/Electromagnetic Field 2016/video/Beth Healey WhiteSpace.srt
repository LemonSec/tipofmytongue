1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,969
hi everyone

2
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,469
so

3
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:14,830
to stage a

4
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:16,070
the next tool

5
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:16,950
CM after

6
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:20,189
seemed very happy to be able to
introduce Beth Healy

7
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:25,500
who's spent 14 months on the South Pole
and it's going to tell us all about

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:35,400
white space and things right to that so
yeah you're better than they are hello

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,839
everybody my name is better than I've
just got back from Antarctica and where

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,420
I was working for the European Space
Agency

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,510
I'm doing research for their
long-duration spaceflight missions so

12
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:48,960
just to set things often give you a bit
of an idea of what we're doing down

13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:49,440
there

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,800
I'd like to just pay the short clip and
much easier of me

15
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,140
at the end of the world

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,290
there's a place so hostile

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,290
that no country homes and

18
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:18,170
explorers call it the last great
wilderness Allah

19
00:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,450
in artists

20
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:26,870
it has inspired visions of beauty

21
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:28,700
and of harm

22
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:30,860
with it's stunning vistas

23
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:33,370
mountains of madness

24
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,630
here

25
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:36,420
when winter comes

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,420
it lasts for months of unbroken .

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:46,750
the air is too thin to breathe normally
and drops to - 80 degrees Celsius

28
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,380
no animals can survive

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:58,330
there is no indigenous population anyone
trapped here when winter comes out of

30
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:05,289
reach has no access or rescue as
possible at all . by ship airplane or

31
00:02:05,289 --> 00:02:08,709
helicopter on life or death

32
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:12,790
there is no escape from the ice

33
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:15,790
this is isolation

34
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,540
it is like you are on another world

35
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,299
yeah

36
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,310
join the story of a lifetime

37
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:05,330
the story of taking the next step
towards the Stars

38
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,610
of leaving this world and game another
one

39
00:03:12,610 --> 00:03:17,950
for by surviving here at the end of the
world we learn how to survive beyond our

40
00:03:17,950 --> 00:03:21,670
home planet earth such as

41
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:26,580
on the move

42
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,890
or on Mars

43
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:42,760
future of human space flight is here and
now and it is real be a part of the

44
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,950
adventure

45
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:49,119
hi my name is Beth Healy medical doctor
of the ether Concordia station over the

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,170
past year

47
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:53,890
join me on my adventures in Antarctica
and prepare yourself to leave this world

48
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:27,370
cool

49
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:30,670
so we do later different research
projects down there so i can only

50
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:34,540
recover a little bit of it here in my
talk today if you guys are interested

51
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,990
a lot more information and also the
results we should come out

52
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,070
I'm are available sort of on these the
website and they just give you a bit of

53
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:46,510
an idea of who I am and how I ended up
going down to Antarctica working for

54
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,170
either

55
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:51,010
I'm so medical doctor and I've got a
background of working as part of a

56
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:55,390
massive expedition medicine team so part
of medical logistical support teams for

57
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,409
endurance races mainly impaired
environment so I've been sort of North

58
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:03,430
Pole Greenland file bards Siberia and
places like that so if there's anybody

59
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:06,190
medics and thanks to you if you're
interested in that kind of thing I'm

60
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:09,100
come and see me often and we can have a
chat about that

61
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:13,180
I'm what was the university has really
fortunate because I got to go to the

62
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:17,260
European Space Agency and learn a bit by
its space medicine which ultimately led

63
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:20,170
to me getting the job working preso dine
in Antarctica

64
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:25,360
not that i am a doctor so I just want to
did anybody know what a spaceflight

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,890
analog is or if they got any experience
of animal programs anyone

66
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:34,599
yeah so you probably one of the most
popular ones and the ones that made

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,290
people would like to do is to spend and
two months in bed and get paid quite a

68
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:41,860
lot of money for it but there's loads of
different analogs and all of them are

69
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,610
good at looking at different things and
so if sample you've got sort of bed rest

70
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,000
studies which is making the effects of
microgravity and not using your muscles

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,680
for long periods of time and you've also
got other ones like underwater programs

72
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,520
which is like the meme a project which
is NASA run and that's mainly used for

73
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,080
astronaut training

74
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,490
Concordia is a little bit like Mars 500
and so much that we're really looking at

75
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:10,540
the isolation . so Mars 500 and came
before and Concordia and this was and

76
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,670
500 a simulated Mars mission which is
done essentially Russian car parks say

77
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,120
the crew of six and people were
recruited as you would

78
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,900
astronauts and we had a mission control
and we did the full simulated Mars

79
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:26,650
mission and this is really good news of
different ways like the research was

80
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,520
really well controlled and also the crew
was much more similar to a crew which

81
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,359
would be selected for spaceflight
mission and but there

82
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,400
is one limitation of an experiment like
this and that is that you do have a door

83
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,138
which you can walk is at any point and
after being down in Antarctica i think

84
00:06:43,139 --> 00:06:47,639
actually i do find that a lot harder to
deal with because if I had known there

85
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:51,389
being a door which I could walk right
over any point i think i probably would

86
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:56,310
have spent 499 of the 500 days when
during whether or not i should do that

87
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,990
and whereas in Antarctica because you
don't have that option and it puts

88
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:04,680
different pressures and whether it's
easier or more difficult i'm not really

89
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:08,129
sure but it's definitely a different
psychological pressure that you have as

90
00:07:08,129 --> 00:07:08,909
a crew

91
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:12,599
whereas in Antarctica during the long
polar winter which is nine months

92
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:16,830
actually completely isolated even in
case of emergency at concordia because

93
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,430
the temperatures are so lay there that
were not able to fly in during the

94
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:21,900
winter

95
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:27,929
so this was concordia and this is my
home for 14 months i just got back in

96
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:33,539
January and it's one of any three of the
Inland stations in Antarctica and then

97
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:37,318
it's up on the dome Charlie plateau was
actually originally built for the ice

98
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,240
core drillings their upper James C we do
they actually have much precipitation or

99
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,889
snow popular tool which means if you
drill diner and sort of to the core it

100
00:07:46,889 --> 00:07:50,550
means that you don't have to drill say
far to go a lot further back in time but

101
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:56,729
that's an aside and so white Mars that
this is what we often known as by either

102
00:07:56,729 --> 00:07:59,310
and there's lots of different reasons
for that

103
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:03,810
and as I mentioned the isolation is
certainly one of them and but there's

104
00:08:03,810 --> 00:08:08,219
also a few others which really useful
for us to use concordia as a spaceflight

105
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:12,719
analog say one of them's we're an
international skeleton cream and so this

106
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:17,310
is my crew that i spent and the
nine-month every winter . with its by a

107
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:21,360
50-50 mix between technical team and
scientific team and so there's lots of

108
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,199
different researchers dying there and I
was the only one working for you to dine

109
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,520
there so all the other

110
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,010
and participants were volunteering for
us but we're international so we had six

111
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:37,860
and French and five Italian and myself
so different languages and also Swiss

112
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:41,310
German chap say that brought in a
different mix -

113
00:08:41,309 --> 00:08:44,939
compared to sort of a base like british
antarctic survey where the predominant

114
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,200
language is English

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,839
we ended up having our own kind of
language which we actually called

116
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:52,649
concordia in which was a mix of
everything and it really came to light

117
00:08:52,649 --> 00:08:57,089
when we had like emergency so we were
actually very fortunate as a cruiser we

118
00:08:57,089 --> 00:09:00,959
didn't have any big emergencies a tool
and but as you can imagine even small

119
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,140
emergencies and those kind of
environments can get out of hand quite

120
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,680
quickly and because it is such an
extreme environment if things do happen

121
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,160
then and go wrong then it's you know
it's very serious

122
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,130
so it's give you an example we just had
a big leak coming through the roof

123
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:17,610
because of the first water pump and
immediately everybody went back to their

124
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:21,570
native languages and it was absolute
chaos in terms of communication so we

125
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:26,760
learned a lot from those kind of
experiences i will also isolated for the

126
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:30,810
nine months but you also very confined
as ecrit day with temperatures would buy

127
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:35,550
it - 80 outside or you can go outside
and a lot of people did most days you

128
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,040
can only guide for short periods of time

129
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,270
so you're actually living sort of on top
of each other and that lives leads to

130
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:46,079
this kind of forced human interactions
which again is a lot like space flight

131
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:51,660
because you are living in a confined
isolated environment also limited with

132
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,469
your supplies

133
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,550
so for nine months of the year we can
get anything in all right at all and and

134
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,510
it's the biggest cooperation to get
things in during the summertime and we

135
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,860
actually get that on the overlanders
reverse which is a big land supply train

136
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:09,029
but unfortunately if you forget a thing
like in space and you can't get it

137
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,550
halfway through their as many of you
might know we've got nabbed or more day

138
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:18,149
night cycle down inside so i actually
was a hundred and five days without

139
00:10:18,149 --> 00:10:22,829
seeing the Sun at all and then during
that period in the summer the opposite

140
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:26,760
way around so 24-hour nighttime and that
affected a lot of people in a lot of

141
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:30,270
different ways and that was another big
thing which is to really interested in

142
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,810
especially the effect that the
artificial lighting on your eyes

143
00:10:33,810 --> 00:10:38,279
and also the way that affect your sleep
wake cycles so I've been working up in

144
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,990
the Arctic a lot so I'm really used to
sort of 24 hour day time and I went down

145
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:45,300
quite smug thinking i'll be absolutely
fine

146
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:49,319
and because it's never affected me the
24-hour daylight but the second that we

147
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,000
lost the Sun I was all over the place in
my sleep wake cycle when I went to pot

148
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,779
and I probably didn't sleep for about
the first three days and that was really

149
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:02,580
interesting for us as a crew because we
are actually ended up sort of forming

150
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,360
subgroups

151
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,529
so we're a crew of 13 and quite
typically form subgroups within that

152
00:11:07,529 --> 00:11:11,820
size and we are actually shifting asked
me to wake cycles and I just think with

153
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:16,680
other people which is the real problem
for communication as a crew and so we

154
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:20,099
actually had to enforce having lunch and
dinner times together to make sure that

155
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,960
we did and stay sort of in as much of us
through the same stadium rhythm as

156
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:28,920
possible and Concordia is all say an
extreme environment

157
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:34,110
say it this is giving you this is a
normal screen shot during a typical

158
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,850
winter day so you can see it's really
low temperatures who got - 81 . for

159
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:43,230
their what you might also notice is that
we're actually at very low pressure so

160
00:11:43,230 --> 00:11:48,480
Concordia is actually 3,300 meters
altitude and because we're in a painter

161
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:53,310
environment that's and personified
because and giving us a sort of alpine

162
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,300
equivalent pressure of about 4,000
meters which is essentially a little bit

163
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:01,140
like living on more block for the year
so that affected a lot of people as well

164
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,850
and also you have real danger

165
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:09,480
when you going outside so it's called
dark and so you have to be very careful

166
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,790
and this is this is what it looked like

167
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:17,099
and you also there for a very long time
so I was there for 14 months and nine

168
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:20,070
months of that was the over winter
period where we didn't see anyone else

169
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:25,470
and we also have water recycling
technology and this is also developed by

170
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:28,709
easier and it is that she wanted the
original prototypes which is you to

171
00:12:28,709 --> 00:12:32,189
develop the current water recycling
system which is now used on the

172
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:36,270
international space station so that men
are having to use that are not normal

173
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:39,600
shampoo or conditioner for an entire
year which for for the girls and like

174
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:41,640
system therefore struggle so you have to

175
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:47,189
you like special things in the shower
and to accommodate for that we also have

176
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:48,990
really good telemedicine facilities

177
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:52,860
so if we are thinking of going on longer
duration spaceflight missions we do you

178
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:57,210
have to think towards and a similar
medical models of that we have done in

179
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,230
Antarctica

180
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,740
if the moment and we have a medical
problem up in space we can evacuate

181
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:05,700
normally within the day and Antarctica
it's a very different stories that we

182
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:08,070
actually had to medical doctors down
there

183
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:13,020
so as myself and also an Italian surgeon
and between us we can more or less deal

184
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:17,460
with most sort of most problems that
could come into and a doctors surgery

185
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:24,000
say now I'd like to just share with you
a little bit of my experience and what

186
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:29,610
what it was that I was doing Diane that
and so before I went away I was sent off

187
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:33,450
to show me and where I left from the PGH
am which is the mountain rescue team

188
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,770
about the pre-hospital care retrieval
medicine and i also went to all the

189
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:41,910
different Institute's who are running
the experiments dying and in Antarctica

190
00:13:41,910 --> 00:13:46,350
for isa but probably the most important
part of my training was actually at the

191
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:52,830
European National Center and say here we
are as a crew meeting for the first time

192
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,730
at the astronauts entering Caillat and
this is actually at the neutral buoyancy

193
00:13:56,730 --> 00:14:03,090
facility and here we had what's called
human behavior performance training and

194
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:06,420
some of you might know that before
astronauts go up into space they're

195
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:09,959
given a lot of training and by this team
which is about living and working

196
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:14,310
together in close proximity and so we're
given all the same training and the

197
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:18,390
astronauts have before they go into
space and so really lucky to have this

198
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:19,439
is a career

199
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,580
we also got to look around all the
training facilities and have a bit of

200
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,360
fun as well

201
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:29,100
they that was really good and this is
astronauts not the christopher etty you

202
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,030
actually was sort of a most mascot for
the rest of our mission and call this up

203
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:36,390
from the International Space Station
dine in Antarctica which was really

204
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:39,600
really cool especially if the Italians
amongst the cream

205
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,240
but like with any experiment so we had
to do all of the baseline testing before

206
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:50,310
we went away and this is envy have which
is big medical research facility which

207
00:14:50,310 --> 00:14:55,439
is run by the dl which is just outside
of the astronauts center and this is

208
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,830
actually where tim peake had all of his
testing and before and after

209
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:04,050
I'm going to space so one of the
experiments we're doing is doing

210
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:08,699
functional MRI scanning of our brains
before we went down and afterwards and

211
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:13,800
then again six months after so I've just
had my last one taken in complain i'm

212
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:18,209
looking for any structural changes which
might advocate and during that isolation

213
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:24,960
. we also had loads of blood tests and
laser different other tests and some of

214
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,230
them were more fun than others and I
think and this Italian chapstick you

215
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:33,150
enjoyed this one of those are two pretty
nurses taking his blood and these are

216
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:36,959
the bed rest studies say this is
actually where all the bed rest

217
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:41,340
facilities or face as well so this is
the and other analog that i mentioned

218
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,510
before

219
00:15:42,510 --> 00:15:46,350
so once we've done three

220
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:50,970
once you've done the testing it was time
to go to Antarctica and there's two ways

221
00:15:50,970 --> 00:15:55,170
of getting there you can either go buy a
boat or you can go by plane and so on my

222
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:59,400
work journey down i actually went by
plane and this is the Hercules plane

223
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:05,189
which took me from Christchurch to
Antarctica and then from there you get a

224
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:09,720
smaller plane which is called a twin off
the plane and from the coast - and the

225
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,940
central station at concordia as you got
a boat on my way back and it's that was

226
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:18,060
amazing experience to say that's sort of
a two-week journey back

227
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:24,660
so here i am this is sixteen thousand
five hundred kilometers from hey

228
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:29,610
and this is the summertime so I was like
oh my goodness when I arrived they

229
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:33,840
pretty chilly day in the summertime
you're talking about - 30 at concordia

230
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,400
the

231
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:38,090
the average temperature but you do have
24-hour daylight and never really low

232
00:16:38,090 --> 00:16:41,210
humidity and so it's actually quite
comfortable it's 11

233
00:16:42,470 --> 00:16:48,410
and this is my previous add your nose
and he was the doctor before me and he

234
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,620
told me probably one of the most
important things for anybody think he

235
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,460
was doing a neighbor winter in
Antarctica and that's how to learn baby

236
00:16:55,460 --> 00:17:01,850
football is a very useful tip and then
all the food and fuel came during the

237
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,290
summers say this is the navel and
reverse and this travels from de

238
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,940
Mandeville station all the way to
concordia which is 1300 kilometers and

239
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:15,500
it does this twice during the summer
season and this is how the experimental

240
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,760
equipment arrives and from me so this is
one of my niece of boxes and so the

241
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,359
summer is a really busy time for setting
up all the experiments which we do every

242
00:17:23,359 --> 00:17:27,949
winter is already really interested in
that period of isolation and say that's

243
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:31,820
the main part of our work we do a little
bit before and after a bit but we're

244
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:36,409
really looking at the effects of the
crew and there's lots of other

245
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:41,390
experiments going on down there's a lot
of glaciology lots of digging and this

246
00:17:41,390 --> 00:17:46,820
is happening actually the anchor coring
project say this is got actually the one

247
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:51,080
of the oldest well the oldest I school
ever drilled which is a hundred thousand

248
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,020
kilometers and a hundred thousand years
old and this is pretty much what it

249
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:01,190
looks like everywhere at concordia it's
completely flat so you do have sort of

250
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:05,990
sensory deprivation as well and like ten
peaks that when he came down from space

251
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:09,260
you don't actually smell anything in
space and it's similar in Antarctica

252
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:12,560
there really isn't any smells so there's
no and that's one of the first things

253
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:16,460
that I noticed when I came back on the
ship is just the you know the smell but

254
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:22,130
they're all around us here and this is
like a typical day during the summer so

255
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:27,020
pretty comfortable outside and also lots
of sport happens

256
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:31,670
well there's it's actually during that
period quite nice easy time but it's all

257
00:18:31,670 --> 00:18:35,330
in preparation for the wintertime so
this is learning how to sort of do these

258
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:39,260
fire escape which is like a big sock
which comes out of the side of the

259
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:43,920
building which is absolutely terrifying
but we also learned lots of

260
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:48,540
the roles they like it because it's a
skeleton create lots of shared roles so

261
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:52,290
although i was there as the doctor I
sort of also learn lots of other things

262
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:53,490
like kicking

263
00:18:53,490 --> 00:18:59,040
I had cleaning jobs and we talk so the
plumber had to scrub into theater and

264
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:03,510
vice versa as and taught how to be a
five and say this is a really busy time

265
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:06,840
for us to take on new skills and learn
how to do different stuff and that's

266
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:10,139
really important as a career living in
that environment is that you are able to

267
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,290
take on different roles and and a lot
like in space

268
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,460
so this is the last plane leaving so
pretty emotional time for everybody and

269
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,460
this is actually going away there and
here we are not as a crew of 13 and this

270
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,360
is the beginning of the able winter and
ether often coolers have a naught switch

271
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:38,159
hitter and when in french means winter
set of winter notes and this is the east

272
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,110
the labs this is my home and for 14
months and I'd like to just give you a

273
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,439
bit of a flavor of the experiments that
we're doing mine that I can't really

274
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,190
cover everything here today but I if you
like to catch me afterwards are

275
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,360
I'll be happy to answer any questions
that you have and do you stop me if

276
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,040
there's something you'd like to ask

277
00:19:56,040 --> 00:20:00,389
I'm the new psychology this is a big
experiment that we were running and

278
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:05,220
between easier and NASA and it was
developing a tool in space which is

279
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:09,660
looking at and the cognition of
astronauts and it is and it's a full

280
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:16,200
part experiment but the main part was
sorry combination battery so the idea is

281
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:20,310
that astronauts do on a regular basis it
looks at lots of different areas that is

282
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:25,530
looking at a risk-taking behavior memory
testing reaction times and but

283
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:30,270
essentially it's a red flag system so
rational just tested against themselves

284
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:34,620
than any different performances a red
flag from Mission Control to be like why

285
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,459
are they doing

286
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,610
are they getting enough food they get
enough exercise sleep for their

287
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,139
emotional problems going on

288
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:43,170
so this is a big thing that we're
developing that's a really exciting

289
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:48,120
thing about Concordia is not only are we
looking at the isolation but also often

290
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:51,250
used to increase subject numbers for
experiments which will say

291
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,790
coming up in space and that's because
astronauts are very few and far between

292
00:20:54,790 --> 00:20:58,600
and soon was its developed things a bit
more quickly and then to have enough

293
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,469
subject to get a reasonable power for
the experiments and we often used to

294
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,300
supplement that and also as part of this
experiment was the functional MRI

295
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:12,909
scanning which I mentioned before and
also wearing activity watches say these

296
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:16,390
activity which is really useful for not
just looking at a general activity

297
00:21:16,390 --> 00:21:21,730
levels but also a sweet wake cycles and
how that was changing over time but

298
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:25,210
perhaps more interesting if these were
also interacting with each other

299
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:29,170
so my which would interact with your
watch and so we know how much time we

300
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,700
spend together as a crew and how
relationships are changing over time and

301
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,150
it would also know where we are on the
base that is looking at habit so sort of

302
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:41,440
how often am I going to the gym how much
time i spending working and interesting

303
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:45,970
the also how much time am i spending
sort of seeking out social interactions

304
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,050
then sort of social spaces for example
the living room or how much time am i

305
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,490
spending and isolating myself and its
really looking at myself and its really

306
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,150
looking at critical time points in the
mission where people are more at risk of

307
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:03,490
isolating themselves and also to have
big arguments and conflicts and the

308
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,880
formation of scrub subgroups within the
crew so it's really looking at sort of

309
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:13,600
crew dynamics and will say more a hard
one into liking our heart races and as I

310
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:18,459
mentioned the cognition battery which we
are developing say these are the beacons

311
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:21,910
which we had on the walls and that was
what was actually with detecting where I

312
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:26,770
watches we're on the base and here's the
cognition battery that we're developing

313
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:32,139
and here is also being done at exactly
the same time by scott Kelly up in space

314
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,280
and it

315
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,220
excitingly has now been taken out of the
research phase and this is actually

316
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:40,900
going to be implemented on the ISS is
just part of normal astra new national

317
00:22:40,900 --> 00:22:44,980
routine in the next couple of months huh

318
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:50,050
and another experiment m is video
diaries say again a bit big brother

319
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:53,649
I'm so we're just speaking doing a video
diary once a week

320
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:59,049
and from this we're trying to develop
and technology which can pick up

321
00:22:59,049 --> 00:23:02,260
nonverbal cues about what we're saying
so it wasn't really looking at the

322
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,669
content of what we're saying

323
00:23:03,669 --> 00:23:07,570
but how we're saying it and whether we
can infer from that and I people are

324
00:23:07,570 --> 00:23:10,750
really feeling despite what they're
saying

325
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:15,730
I was also doing an experiment called
back finder which again was run by the

326
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:19,480
dlr and this is looking for extreme
bacteria that can survive in the

327
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,490
environment that we have at concordia so
with such low temperatures and the

328
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:28,990
conditions are really similar to other
planets for example miles and so if we

329
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:33,429
could find new species of bacteria which
are able to survive at concordia and

330
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,460
then perhaps this can tell us a little
bit more about what

331
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:41,230
perhaps we could find on other planets
elsewhere at the moment we've never find

332
00:23:41,230 --> 00:23:43,840
the thing to be able to survive at
concordia outside

333
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,320
other than of course the humans living
there is never one to agree but we've

334
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,428
never find any bacteria outside so my
samples have come back on the ship and

335
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,520
they really just arrived back in Europe
but fingers crossed will find something

336
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,770
exciting that and this Carrie don't know
what to write the whole winter say this

337
00:23:59,770 --> 00:24:04,330
is me finding the pole where I was
taking my samples from and that's

338
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,100
actually a lot harder than I thought

339
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:09,490
so the first time I went I during the
winter i did what i normally did and

340
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,230
just you know take my pad to my
equipment and it really did

341
00:24:14,230 --> 00:24:17,710
and let me know that I was sort of in
the extreme environments there i opened

342
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:22,240
up my pad and the the glue on the the
spine of the pad just break completely

343
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:26,470
straight away all the pages went flying
and I took out my experiments to take

344
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:30,460
all the media data and all the batteries
run out completely excited had them in

345
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:34,270
my rucksack and my girls were completely
i started my fingers are freezing so i

346
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:36,850
had to go back inside and sort of start
again

347
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:40,570
but it it really did make me realize how
difficult it is to take these kind of

348
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:47,750
data in an environment like this and
this was just after doing that

349
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:51,890
and we will see look to the effects of
artificial lighting on our eyes and this

350
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,730
then was particularly looking at
people's reactions and and I just like

351
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:58,280
this experiment because it demonstrates
how

352
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,500
although all the research is designed by
either and and sort of for Space Flight

353
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:08,120
I'm it's also very relevant to a lot of
medical research which is happening back

354
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,679
in England

355
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,330
so for example this one is really
relevant people working for long periods

356
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:18,649
of time using artificial life for
example sort of factory workers and

357
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:21,740
doing a lot of night shift so a lot of
the experiments are they they're

358
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:27,590
designed to ward space and are actually
relevant to a lot of people and their

359
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:30,889
this is just to say that there were lots
and lots of other samples as well so

360
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,040
I've actually got a little Bowl patch on
the back of my head still and because

361
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:38,810
they took so many hair samples from me
as well so it was constant constant

362
00:25:38,810 --> 00:25:43,760
sample times so I was it's really being
the easy doctor in Concordia is very

363
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,230
much just by being mr. mayor Bader
you're constantly asking people and if

364
00:25:48,230 --> 00:25:50,810
they'll donate things and for you say

365
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:56,510
and if anyone think you're doing it be
prepared for that and then this is one

366
00:25:56,510 --> 00:26:00,830
more experiment that we're doing and see
if we are to go on long duration

367
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:03,830
missions it's a lot easier to build
space flight and slightly lower

368
00:26:03,830 --> 00:26:06,379
atmospheric pressure and i'm here on
earth

369
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:10,160
I'm so it's interesting to look at this
chronic low level of hypoxia

370
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,160
so we're not really interested in sort
of what it's like up on the top and one

371
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,910
brought that sorry my neveress but we
are more interested in looking at so

372
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:20,630
precious that you get around the mont
blanc which is what we were at I'm so

373
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:24,590
this is an arterial blood gas machine
and I was taking Venus and capillary

374
00:26:24,590 --> 00:26:29,840
samples down there and looking at
through our excursion nation status and

375
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,220
so this is me at the gym and this was
just a few wisely the month before i was

376
00:26:34,220 --> 00:26:38,210
about to leave and so I've been here for
14 months and I definitely a climate is

377
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:42,980
I could tell that from my blood so i'll
actually alkyl otic in terms my ph which

378
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:48,530
is typical for somebody who's
acclimatize well that you can see here

379
00:26:48,530 --> 00:26:52,280
even with a little bit of exercise is
saturating at eighty-eight percent and

380
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:54,230
for anybody that's medical amongst you

381
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:54,759
and

382
00:26:54,759 --> 00:26:58,389
typically it's supposed to be about
ninety-eight percent and if I presented

383
00:26:58,389 --> 00:27:02,799
to any department with a saturations in
England I would sort of be admitting

384
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:03,699
myself

385
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:08,019
so you really are having some really low
oxygenation even at the end of being a

386
00:27:08,019 --> 00:27:13,539
climatisation I and this is just to say
that and there's lots of different

387
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,499
experiments happening there and they
tend to change each year so this is a

388
00:27:17,499 --> 00:27:21,369
new one that reported in this summer and
this is the Soyuz space flight

389
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:25,448
simulators say this is the actual one
that we used to Train astronauts on and

390
00:27:25,449 --> 00:27:29,589
this has been taking down to Antarctica
and to look at school risk retention

391
00:27:29,589 --> 00:27:34,599
over time and say this one more training
and crew on different training schedules

392
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:38,529
and looking at sort of what's best i'm
in terms of retaining skills without

393
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:42,519
putting too much pressure on her crew
and this is also to look at whether we

394
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:46,209
need to be considering taking something
like a space flight simulator on a

395
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:50,349
long-duration mission because the last
thing you want is your rationale to

396
00:27:50,349 --> 00:27:54,399
arrive at Mars are not be able to land
the spaceship say this is the kind of

397
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:59,559
thing that we're looking at here and
then this is just give you a bit of an

398
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,209
idea about what life and on bases like
other than doing the Easter experiments

399
00:28:04,209 --> 00:28:08,859
and say as user md i was I doing a lot
of the medical rescue training

400
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:13,089
so this is us and it's a lot harder than
you might think to pick up a casualty

401
00:28:13,089 --> 00:28:16,989
with sort of three different languages
and think balaclavas and thinks that

402
00:28:16,989 --> 00:28:20,019
this is a lot of our time we spent
training doing things like this

403
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:24,908
we also do a big evacuation of the
entire bass string the over winter as

404
00:28:24,909 --> 00:28:28,839
well which takes them a couple of days
to do and this is because the

405
00:28:28,839 --> 00:28:32,678
temperatures are so later if we were to
have a power failure and it would be

406
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,149
catastrophic unless we were able to set
up the new generators which live in the

407
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:40,809
summer camps there's lots of them lots
of other things which you might also to

408
00:28:40,809 --> 00:28:44,529
think about and when you're working down
and for a neighbor winter

409
00:28:45,699 --> 00:28:50,079
i also did the analysis of the water
that we had dinosaur the greywater

410
00:28:50,079 --> 00:28:54,969
recycling and and we had lots of
problems with people peeing in the

411
00:28:54,969 --> 00:29:00,069
shower so unfortunately unlike on the
ISS we're not able to remove a mania

412
00:29:00,069 --> 00:29:03,249
from the shower so and if people do you
pee in the shower

413
00:29:03,249 --> 00:29:04,440
concordia please day

414
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:12,210
say it's my advice is pretty grotty and
they know I'm lot of my friends and

415
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,920
family is just like that one

416
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,310
do you want to go to Antarctica 14
months there

417
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:20,909
I just like to show you some of the
pictures and sort of explain why it is a

418
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:25,290
great place to go and sort of do some
research and the first one is the

419
00:29:25,290 --> 00:29:29,280
Aurora's here you can see like a tiny
little roar which is coming off the left

420
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:35,610
hand side of the tower that and also in
terms of the social side and we did say

421
00:29:35,610 --> 00:29:39,389
this is a chef Luca they actually had an
Italian chef Beth I can't complain too

422
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,200
much

423
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,680
although we didn't have any fresh fruit
and vegetables for the entire time that

424
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:44,670
we were there

425
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,420
I'm as part of when you're working down
in Antarctica we have lots of lights of

426
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,410
inter and heartache things going on so
we have an inter Antarctic film festival

427
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:56,070
and we also have an instrumentality
darts tournament so we skype all the

428
00:29:56,070 --> 00:30:01,530
other bases and play darts against each
other essentially say and uh huh and a

429
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:05,370
half way through my window just after
mid winter and it was time to skype with

430
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,959
Scott face which is them

431
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,730
sorry sighs poor baby and a half way
through the darts match they brought a

432
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:15,450
watermelon which I was absolutely
devastated sticks i haven't had fresh

433
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,710
fruit and vegetables and for all that
time so if anyone think you doing when

434
00:30:19,710 --> 00:30:24,270
to definitely consider getting somewhere
where they have hydroponic and plant

435
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:24,810
gray

436
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:29,399
so I was pretty upset by that and but
little did a great job in terms of every

437
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,940
Saturday night especially we used to
have a difference of meal and this is

438
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:35,460
the English night that we had going on
down there

439
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,520
people often ask me about communication
and so we did have internet access and

440
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,139
we could skype as well so we had one
skype computer down there and if we're

441
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:49,350
doing conferences and things like that
we could dedicate the line to do a good

442
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:54,240
sort of skype cool and say we did were
welcomed unica at we work

443
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,120
sorry we did have some good
communication that respect and we also

444
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,770
had what's that say we weren't
completely isolated but we didn't have

445
00:31:01,770 --> 00:31:05,490
sort of internet on individual computers
so you sort of have to go to

446
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:08,670
a special computer where you can access
your emails and things and it was very

447
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:09,450
slow

448
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,140
I mean you could sort of check your
google check your facebook probably but

449
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,290
you couldn't really prized the internet
so that's the kind of level that we had

450
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:20,129
during the winter we do that we have two
months where nothing worked to tools so

451
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,840
we just had a staffing and I'm I'm still
on the fence as to whether it's easier

452
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,879
or harder without communications so when
you have good communication is great so

453
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:33,630
if you have an argument or something and
you can quickly sort of you know what

454
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:38,100
that back him and then be on skype and
not too . which which was great and but

455
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,020
also it's quite hard to sort of detach
yourself from home and sort of form as

456
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,800
the crew

457
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:47,309
so a lot of the time you know on a
saturday night a lot of my friends with

458
00:31:47,309 --> 00:31:50,490
some sort of selfies on my right side
and London you know you did sort of

459
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:55,230
consider oh and why am i SAT here in the
middle of an start to go on my and so

460
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:58,980
and then during the period where we
didn't have any communications you don't

461
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,340
have any of that sort of external
pressure and also you can have bad news

462
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:05,159
and things coming from home which put
pressure on the crew and sort of

463
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:09,030
relationship great fans and things as
well and so some people actually find it

464
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:12,300
a lot easier during that time when we
didn't have any communication with the

465
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,169
outside world

466
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,040
say I'm yeah I haven't really decided
which was easier but they definitely

467
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:23,309
baby have their their pros and cons and
this is just to remind me there are lots

468
00:32:23,309 --> 00:32:27,809
of and science goes on all year that and
that these are some of the guys really

469
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:30,090
dedicated scientist and we're going out

470
00:32:30,090 --> 00:32:34,169
absolutely every day to take all these
new samples and things and nights I'd

471
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:37,530
say is the donkey and he has got excited
to once a month

472
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:40,889
I did go outside a lot more than that
but I'm sort of in terms of the job

473
00:32:40,890 --> 00:32:45,059
description that's what we have to do
and but these guys were getting out sort

474
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:49,290
of absolutely every day and climbing out
big towers which for 40 meters high and

475
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,610
sort of - 80 conditions say so there's
lots of great science going on in

476
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:54,659
Antarctica

477
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:58,860
I've been called including in particular
we have six make a switch is look for

478
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:03,030
seismic activity under grand occasion
you get to go inside them when they're

479
00:33:03,030 --> 00:33:07,620
doing a sort of changes the experiments
with this is inside them and they're

480
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,620
really weird you can sort of write on
the wall and blazed through

481
00:33:11,539 --> 00:33:15,679
and we also have big lasers getting off
say and these could light up

482
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,039
I mean they're sort of testing the
atmosphere is love you might already

483
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:24,830
know but this is the night sky and say
this is this photo was actually taken

484
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:28,970
around lunch time and this is really
what it looked like all the way through

485
00:33:28,970 --> 00:33:31,789
the winter . so it really was

486
00:33:31,789 --> 00:33:35,299
you could see the Milky Way clear as day
at any time so it's the sort of

487
00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:42,229
stargazing paradise and during the sort
of every either end of the period where

488
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:46,669
we didn't see the Sun you did actually
and see a kind of like it's a little bit

489
00:33:46,669 --> 00:33:50,929
like the Sun just that the horizon so
you have like that little glow at the

490
00:33:50,929 --> 00:33:53,960
edge that you could kind of tell whether
it's day or night but during the middle

491
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,769
of the winter

492
00:33:54,769 --> 00:33:58,580
that was absolutely no way i could tell
you what kind of you know what day it

493
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:04,039
was and and it's strange how we did
shift in terms of patterns and it and it

494
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:07,429
really was any I lunch and dinner which
did keep us together as a crew during

495
00:34:07,429 --> 00:34:11,540
that period and it wasn't an intentional
thing you know as a crew we were you

496
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,429
know relative here on good terms

497
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:17,000
all together but it you just sort of
naturally shifted sort of the scientists

498
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:20,960
tend to work better it so that later on
at night time and where as sort of

499
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,418
technical team you tend to have more of
a structure day

500
00:34:23,418 --> 00:34:27,290
so working together say it really did
form a big problem we can definitely see

501
00:34:27,290 --> 00:34:32,659
that on the data that big shift that
happened and what these enemies and some

502
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:40,879
of the Aurora's we had and then there as
well so pretty beautiful and this is the

503
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:42,199
son that came back

504
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:45,710
say this is the first time we've seen
the Sun is a really emotional time for

505
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:49,730
everybody and you really did feel the
energy levels just saw through the roof

506
00:34:49,730 --> 00:34:50,929
when this came say

507
00:34:50,929 --> 00:34:55,309
and during the winter it's like really
hard to motivate yourself to do anything

508
00:34:55,309 --> 00:34:59,299
back here in England and sort of running
to and fro from lots of different places

509
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:03,259
and it was really busy gave the gym
exercise regularly need these kind of

510
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:06,920
things whereas actually use you really
slow down you feel like kind of

511
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:09,950
hibernating a little bit and even
writing an email is that is like a

512
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:13,910
massive struggle and that as soon as the
Sun came back we really did you feel

513
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:19,790
energized and then this is what it kind
of looks like and makes the other times

514
00:35:19,790 --> 00:35:22,440
you get this weird pinky purple and the

515
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,880
the sort of purply great that you can
see that and is apparently and the

516
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,210
shadow of the earth that you can see as
you're rotating round which is pretty

517
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:31,230
cool

518
00:35:31,230 --> 00:35:36,180
and this is the plane that came back to
together and this is Jim

519
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,078
so he's a pilot that work site in
Antarctica and every year I think the

520
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,460
past 15 years and he was actually
involved in the recent evacuation that

521
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:48,750
you might have heard of at the South
Pole basis as well that he is really

522
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:52,680
people like this which managed to keep
everything running and I was very

523
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:56,250
grateful that you didn't get lost on the
way back when he came to came to pick me

524
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:57,000
up

525
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:03,720
and here i am on the day so and this is
another point that I noticed was so

526
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,049
people which weren't keeping say well
with the evidence . in the isolation

527
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:11,910
actually got on the first plane I off
concordia so I'm it wasn't that initial

528
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,509
plan that came in BOS playing through a
few days afterwards and say they had a

529
00:36:15,510 --> 00:36:20,310
massive and shot between sort of going
from sort of the isolation of the every

530
00:36:20,310 --> 00:36:25,290
winter . into sort of normal society as
it were and there but the people who are

531
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:30,119
keeping a little bit better actually had
more prolonged and so we introduction

532
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:34,710
back to sort of normal life say it was
quite interesting to see however and and

533
00:36:34,710 --> 00:36:39,420
how people were keeping going back into
sort of seeing people and some people

534
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,810
that she resented the first plane coming
back because they felt like it was a big

535
00:36:42,810 --> 00:36:47,940
sort of invasion of that hangs so it was
interesting to psychologically have that

536
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,900
affected people and also the loss of
roles within the base say a station

537
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:56,099
leader was obviously a citation needed
during the winter . but he was

538
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:59,430
superseded by somebody came during the
summer and there's also a conflict and

539
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,819
friction with these big changes that
happen

540
00:37:02,819 --> 00:37:09,150
and this brings me to the last part of
my story in Antarctica and say as part

541
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:12,990
of the Easter experiment back find that
i actually had the opportunity to go on

542
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:16,200
the oval and resupply traverse which I
mentioned at the beginning of the

543
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,339
presentation so the big land train and
so we went to hear from Kat program

544
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:22,440
which is the little red dot on the

545
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:27,420
the case that and this is where we set
up all of the Traverse and read rave and

546
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:33,510
back to Concordia station so i flew to
capture him and to drive back and these

547
00:37:33,510 --> 00:37:36,960
are the some of the guys here again a
working in antarctic a year after year

548
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:41,460
and really are the lifeblood for all the
experiments and everything which is

549
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,900
going down on diner say and it's a
really grateful to all these guys who I

550
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:48,960
managed to keep all the experiments
running and it's a lot again it's a lot

551
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:53,099
like space fighting there's a huge teams
behind all the experiments and all the

552
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:56,910
Nationals going up into his face and say
this is just to just to show you all the

553
00:37:56,910 --> 00:38:00,359
guys that have dedicated their lives i
mean some of these guys have worked for

554
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,910
like 10 / winters in Antarctica

555
00:38:02,910 --> 00:38:08,129
I'm amazed that these guys working on
the Traverse have done about 15 15 or 20

556
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:10,740
years dinosaur a big periods of time

557
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:21,029
so these are some of the guys that i was
fortunate enough to work with say and

558
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,869
then they kindly added me to their teeth
and there's no all glamorous working

559
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:30,270
thesis there i was here and the two days
changing and the screws on a caterpillar

560
00:38:30,270 --> 00:38:33,839
tractor tractor and there's all
different roles that you got to get

561
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,940
involved with it's just something that I
really enjoyed and an entry friends

562
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:42,690
style i was given some half an hour
driving lesson which was involved sort

563
00:38:42,690 --> 00:38:47,099
of driving when these huge challenge
attractive sit around a little circuit

564
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,119
they put on an l playing on the back of
mine and and then we are off across the

565
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,349
Antarctic Plateau

566
00:38:52,349 --> 00:38:56,250
fortunately there's not too much that
you can crash into other than the other

567
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:58,560
tracks so it wasn't a bad

568
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:03,029
and here we are this is and the land
train is quite hard to get the whole

569
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:09,000
thing into the pictures and two in terms
of how it works you've got to challenge

570
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,630
tractors which of these huge tractors
which made specifically for the Traverse

571
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:18,569
or modified for the trimmers and so you
driving try two pairs and we had four

572
00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:21,150
sets of tractor paths eight big
challenge

573
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,320
tractors and each try to pair

574
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:27,580
is driving sort of tied up to each other
so you have won a big piece of writing a

575
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:31,540
second one and then a huge amount of
weight in equipment behind it on these

576
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:36,550
sort of special skis and these little
and trainers here these are actually the

577
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:40,870
ones which carried the fuel and so this
is how we drive across we also have

578
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:44,589
three snow flies so you have once nope i
right at the beginning one in the middle

579
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:48,130
and then one at the back as well and the
snow please come and help you out if

580
00:39:48,130 --> 00:39:52,540
anything happens hey there's a very
maneuverable and where's the big tractor

581
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:57,100
sort of go in a in a massive line and
say and that's how it works

582
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:02,860
hey Here I am in time I tried to have a
bit of an attractive selfie there and

583
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:07,090
this is in my chest day I spent
christmas and new year's this year and

584
00:40:07,090 --> 00:40:12,520
driving in one of these trenches and
this was yet the second of January that

585
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,970
this is taken and you can see in front
of their that I'm say we're gonna try to

586
00:40:15,970 --> 00:40:17,859
pair there so that was my hair

587
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:21,730
actually when you go from the case you
drive as a pet were not prepared at all

588
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:25,240
at three tracks that is even more
because actually the initial bit from

589
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,470
the cases a lot steeper so we sort of
drivers three for that first day and

590
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,000
just in case you're interested

591
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:35,620
yeah and also got to experience some of
the bad weather that you have in

592
00:40:35,620 --> 00:40:36,520
Antarctica

593
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,640
you're quiet so it will be the
temperatures are really lower concordia

594
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:43,150
aging actually see very bad weather at
all the skies are always really clear

595
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:45,370
because you don't have that
precipitation you don't actually have

596
00:40:45,370 --> 00:40:49,330
much window tool and but it's certainly
not the case at the case and the

597
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:53,410
temperature is actually a lot let and a
lot higher at the case and but you do

598
00:40:53,410 --> 00:40:56,740
get to see what these sort of exciting
storms and this is one that we are

599
00:40:56,740 --> 00:41:00,040
driving through and this is actually my
track to try to number six

600
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:05,110
so but you do have your problem so this
is how I spent New Year's the actually

601
00:41:05,110 --> 00:41:10,180
and so this all came off the sort of
raid that we built and say the French

602
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,450
said that this is the Italians the
Italian said that it was the french as

603
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,859
long as it wasn't the brit I didn't
really care for you and this is how we

604
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:20,680
did that and and then these are ya

605
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:25,839
this is just the the tractor so at
nighttime you and pop up all the track

606
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,290
together and we should plug them into an
electricity supply as well so that's how

607
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:33,910
they did and freeze overnight and the
reason i was doing this experiment is I

608
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:35,569
was taking snow samples

609
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:38,630
and during the whole length of the
Traverse and we're looking at the

610
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:43,609
transition between where we do find
bacteria at the coast and animals of the

611
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:47,779
sea surviving so all the Penguins and
things about the coast to somewhere like

612
00:41:47,779 --> 00:41:51,799
concordia where we didn't have any life
and five narrow to land so we're looking

613
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:56,629
I know it's also the Traverse provides
us with a pristine untouched environment

614
00:41:56,630 --> 00:42:00,979
because this reverse any happens two
times a year and so if you go off the

615
00:42:00,979 --> 00:42:04,549
track is just a little bit you're
walking in sort of part of Antarctica

616
00:42:04,549 --> 00:42:08,299
there's never been more time before and
so it's really exciting opportunity to

617
00:42:08,299 --> 00:42:12,529
be able to take sort of snow samples
from this virgin snow which was a real

618
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,209
pleasure to get to do

619
00:42:14,209 --> 00:42:18,828
ok and then it was the same time

620
00:42:18,829 --> 00:42:22,819
k and this is the bait that I got back
so it's called the italica and I got

621
00:42:22,819 --> 00:42:24,949
that that back to Christchurch

622
00:42:24,949 --> 00:42:29,599
so I'd like to spend the rest of my talk
and just going through any questions

623
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:32,599
that anybody has a shapely do you have

624
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:45,340
yeah

625
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:55,370
and did you find the behavior and
location tracking presses which I

626
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,870
imagine it would in an ordinary job if
you if people knew where you were all

627
00:42:59,870 --> 00:43:01,730
the time and we're analyzing it

628
00:43:01,730 --> 00:43:06,020
it must affect your behavior as well
surely well I thought that might be the

629
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:10,160
case that the beginning and but the way
we were tracking people who is using and

630
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,730
watches I mean obviously everybody was
consented to the experiments that

631
00:43:13,730 --> 00:43:17,720
everybody knew what the watches for and
what we're doing with them and the fact

632
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:21,890
that we are tracking people and but you
are dying they're wearing these watches

633
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:27,650
for 14 months and so the sort of after a
few weeks i think i'm a service kind of

634
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:31,400
forgot ready but we're even being
tracked a tool and certainly you know I

635
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,040
don't think I changed my habits because
of it

636
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:37,610
I mean I think at some point you did I
did wonder especially because obviously

637
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:40,730
i'm working for user who's running the
experiment I mean they know how often

638
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:43,760
you're spending in the lab and like how
I lost in your spending working away you

639
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,970
are doing doing things but it was all
confidential in terms of sort of what we

640
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:50,569
find

641
00:43:50,570 --> 00:43:55,250
so I think because nobody on the base
and got sort of direct feedback in terms

642
00:43:55,250 --> 00:43:59,840
of sort of their habits and what they
were doing and I don't think it really

643
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,140
affected the croup obviously I mean that
is the limitation with all the

644
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,400
experiments and that you are doing with
people because we do know that we're

645
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:09,680
being tracked or doing experiments on

646
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:13,279
I think I didn't think the tracking one
was really affected by that I think the

647
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:17,510
one which was probably more affected
would have been the Koala which is the

648
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:21,380
video diaries I think people for a lot
more self-conscious doing that I'm

649
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,580
having said that with something like
koala and again you're looking for

650
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:29,690
nonverbal cues and and astronauts would
also have some similar pressures in

651
00:44:29,690 --> 00:44:33,830
terms of that they know that they're
being watched him sort of analyzed as

652
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:37,340
well when they're talking to Mission
Control so I mean it's different it's

653
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:41,330
difficult to say and but i think just
because we are wearing them all the time

654
00:44:41,330 --> 00:44:45,890
for so long i think that people did kind
of forget and that they were wearing

655
00:44:45,890 --> 00:44:48,980
them and there's also a them something
that you can't really modify in terms of

656
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,570
you know your sleep wake cycle as well
which we were unable to get data from we

657
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:56,930
were really lucky to get that data
because it's quite hard to get ethics

658
00:44:56,930 --> 00:44:59,609
for that kind of experiment and it's one
of the few of

659
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:03,870
have been able to actually get that and
on a platform one sort of your research

660
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:06,870
platforms that is quite an unique data
set in that respect

661
00:45:07,710 --> 00:45:13,440
yeah i can see so i can see we've got a
few more questions and 44 time we

662
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,240
haven't got time to awesome here right
now but would you mind they're asking

663
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,810
there are three questions that I just
often yeah absolutely so everybody was

664
00:45:21,810 --> 00:45:23,340
going to questions please off

665
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:25,500
ok thank you thank you very much indeed
