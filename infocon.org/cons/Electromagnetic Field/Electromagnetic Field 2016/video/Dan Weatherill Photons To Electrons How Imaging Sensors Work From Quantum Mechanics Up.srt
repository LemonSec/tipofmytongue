1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,719
however

2
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:16,530
you hear me yeah good right

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,550
so I'm before i start on this or any
other physicists in the room

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:25,950
hands up ok to those people I apologize
that this isn't good incredibly not

5
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:28,529
interesting and not in depth as you
might like it

6
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:33,960
any complete non physicist in the room
and two people I apologize that it might

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:37,110
be a little bit quick and and covering a
lot of stuff

8
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,440
so have I am I

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,149
I I my name is down whether all and i am
a detective physicist at the University

10
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:46,020
of Oxford

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,470
I work on some of the things you see in
the picture

12
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:54,239
I'm it modern science is done using
detectives of some kind basically our

13
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,410
only window into the world is
electromagnetic radiation even for

14
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,578
example I go detector which detects
gravitational waves does it by the weak

15
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,970
coupling of those gravitational waves
into interferometers which are

16
00:01:05,970 --> 00:01:10,140
electromagnetic and so electromagnetic
detector is a very important and what I

17
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,770
want to try and illustrate to you guys
is some of the basic concepts that unify

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:17,789
all these things in the pictures of the
top left there we have the SSD telescope

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,130
which is when it's built is currently
being built there will be the most

20
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:24,810
powerful digital camera in the world

21
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:29,250
I mean 3.2 megapixels so you need a
fellow of hard drives for a thousand

22
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:32,340
images tonight produces about 20
terabytes of imaging data every night

23
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,370
for 10 years so that's not my problem
look like

24
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:41,940
and on the bottom left there we have the
the Atlas detector the LHC in CERN on

25
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,190
the bottom right as well and in the
middle which you've probably heard about

26
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:47,820
if you've been to any of the top is
going to talk yesterday and there's a

27
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,029
couple of other talks about the Alexei
and let things I think

28
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:56,430
and in the center we have the humble
sony DSLR and these devices to the

29
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,540
interested party

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:00,869
look very different and they look very
different to the outside as well

31
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:03,570
there is a middle ground to connect all
these things and that is that they are

32
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:07,798
basically digital cameras for light made
with silicon and that's what I'm going

33
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:09,390
to talk about how those work

34
00:02:09,389 --> 00:02:15,149
I'm so basically there are a lot of
steps in this process a digital camera

35
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,530
or an imaging sensor is something that
goes from that top left box photons to

36
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,129
the bottom left box digital images and
most people

37
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:27,830
just interested in that ok that but left
are all there

38
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:31,130
if you're in this room going to assume
you're slightly interested in the other

39
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:36,260
funerals where we call via nearly free
electrons in semiconductors and we can

40
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,350
find those electrons and then we turn
them into a voltage right that's

41
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:43,460
basically how imaging sensors work we
turn four times in two electrons we

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:48,140
catch the electrons we count how many
electrons are simple as a few details

43
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:53,929
and we'll try and spend the next while
doing so incidentally if anybody during

44
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,200
the why go through this once to ask me
anything

45
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,700
like I'd like to be asked because this
is intended to be introductory talk for

46
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:07,970
people who are interested so yeah so I
will start off with the EM spectrum the

47
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:13,730
EM spectrum is cuz radio waves visible
light to x-rays they're all photons

48
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:19,340
there's wave-particle duality of course
or photons are waves and particles and

49
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:24,050
for the purposes of sensors that work in
solid-state like Silicon you almost will

50
00:03:24,050 --> 00:03:27,110
always want to consider things as
photons and force one's a little packets

51
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:32,420
of energy and and visible light photons
so the ones that are striking your eyes

52
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:36,018
so you can see this picture the moment
typically have a couple of electron

53
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:41,239
volts of energy that's some small number
times ten to the minus 19 joules

54
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:44,480
so it's a small of energy per photon but
those are actually quite high energy

55
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,109
photons compared to two ready with the
thing to remember about photons and

56
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,150
electromagnetic spectrum is longer
wavelengths means lower energy so x rays

57
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:57,140
have very short wavelengths very high
energy four times

58
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,910
ok and the energy of photon in the
visible corresponds to what we perceive

59
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:03,049
as color

60
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:11,239
so read things have lower energy photons
and blue things and the underlying thing

61
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,440
but behind how all sensors work is the
photoelectric effect all solid-state

62
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,279
sensors

63
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:20,029
this was not discovered by einstein in
1905 it was discovered in the the

64
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:25,099
eighteen seventies but it was explained
by Einstein 1905 in terms of the what

65
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:28,820
was then new thing called the quantum
theory and he won the nobel prize for

66
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,960
that in 1921

67
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,930
so interesting the a-line style count
with general relativity multiple

68
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,580
consider that to be his greatest
achievement

69
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,740
he also came up with a lot of
interesting results in statistical

70
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,580
thermodynamics

71
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:42,080
the one he actually won the nobel prize
for was the photoelectric effect the

72
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,099
photoelectric effect basically is the
effect where you have electrons bound

73
00:04:46,099 --> 00:04:50,150
around the atoms and atoms has a nucleus
and it has electrons in orbital states

74
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:57,289
around it and if you collide a photon
into an electron with sufficient energy

75
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:59,300
can be released from that Adam

76
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:03,469
ok so that is that is basically once you
understand that you understand the

77
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,189
mechanism by how all optical sensors
work

78
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:13,849
we have a a lump of silicon which has
atoms in it four times come in if they

79
00:05:13,849 --> 00:05:17,180
have sufficient energy we can knock
electrons out the atoms and then we will

80
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,940
measure those electrons with the
electronics right

81
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,330
so any questions on that stage

82
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:34,008
ok of course and it's not simple as that
even those who love to mess around with

83
00:05:34,009 --> 00:05:37,189
quantum mechanics will have heard of the
Pauli exclusion principle of the pap

84
00:05:37,189 --> 00:05:43,159
basically when you have a solid your
electrons are of a delocalized

85
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:47,270
throughout solid in most types always
crystal lattice structure and this is

86
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,240
this is largely due to the translational
symmetry of crystal crystal structures

87
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:58,909
I the Pauli exclusion principle says nor
two electrons can be in the same energy

88
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:02,750
state their spin as well which is a
factor of two but in this case is not

89
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,889
much of a complication

90
00:06:03,889 --> 00:06:11,240
and so what that means is in a big lump
of something like a silicon crystal noir

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,500
two electrons can occupy exactly the
same energy state which means there are

92
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:19,460
trillions of possible energy states in
the silicon crystal and intellectual

93
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,419
must occupy one

94
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,508
and so what happens is those energy
states are very close to each other and

95
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:27,620
form bands so so the these lines at the
bottom here this of the bottom right

96
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:31,969
that is called a band structure and it's
basically a diagram of momentum along

97
00:06:31,969 --> 00:06:35,960
the bottom so basically direction which
direction electrons traveling vs energy

98
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:40,940
at the top and the orange lines are
positions where an electron can have

99
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:44,360
that energy quantum mechanics allows it
to have that energy by the power of

100
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,620
exclusion principle

101
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:50,900
the blue shaded region is a thing called
a band gap and that is a region where

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,310
they're simply do not exist possible
energy states for electrons so in a

103
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,960
solid if you have an electron in Silicon
that energy there in the blue region

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,680
cannot be occupied by an electron
quantum mechanics it doesn't allow it

105
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,169
right and this is useful for us because
electrons fill up from the bottom lower

106
00:07:09,169 --> 00:07:14,719
energy is at the bottom and so in normal
conditions those states those are

107
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,880
instead to the bottom a largely fall and
the ones above the gap largely empty and

108
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:24,169
that means that we can shoot some energy
in with enough energy we can pop

109
00:07:24,169 --> 00:07:28,460
electrons from underneath the gap to on
top of the gap and then they'll be free

110
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,448
to move around

111
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm this is not a unique property of
silicon there are many semiconductors

112
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,260
the thing about silicon that makes it so
ideal is that we happen to live in a

113
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,659
world where we have a room temperature
of about 20 degrees and at that

114
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:45,590
temperature

115
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:49,729
silicon's bandgap the the thing called
the Fermi energy which is the energy

116
00:07:49,729 --> 00:07:53,630
that electrons want to have basically
it's the thermal energy that every

117
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:59,060
electron on average once silicon at
temperatures that we live at that Fermi

118
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,900
energy is right in the middle of the
band gap and that means that silicon is

119
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:06,919
a very convenient semiconductor for us
to use at temperatures that we live at

120
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:11,659
because at room temperature there are
very few electrons are crossed over and

121
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,630
not Fermi energy is exactly what we want
in the gap

122
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:19,250
so our electrons are sitting just below
the gap and we can fire n GN and get

123
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,260
them above the gap very easily

124
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,630
they're all the semiconductors which
only become something to note is that -

125
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:25,849
a hundred pretty useless to make a
camera that you want to carry around

126
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:26,690
with

127
00:08:26,690 --> 00:08:34,490
I'm crucial to this is the concept of
holes so so things like this you have to

128
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:37,159
kind of think of two diagrams at once
you have to think of energy diagram with

129
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:39,950
energy going up the scale like we have
the previous slide and then a separate

130
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:45,290
diagram with space if i move an electron
from underneath that gap to all the gap

131
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:46,459
using energy

132
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:51,170
I've left behind a hole and I the
technical term a-hole and and if these

133
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,699
this electron moves around a bit in
space but that high energy

134
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,220
it's moved away from where the hole was
and the whole now looks like

135
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:03,329
for identity and it turns out that
statistically you can treat these holes

136
00:09:03,329 --> 00:09:07,349
just as particles we call in quasi
particles with positive charge

137
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:11,160
so in a semiconductor you have charge
which is carried by free electrons in

138
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,639
the conduction band and charge which is
carried by free holes in the valence

139
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:18,269
band which is just the bits left behind
when we promote the electron is all very

140
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,490
mind-bending I hope it will become clear
soon over

141
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,730
you have to get this list of all the way
of working to tell you how camera works

142
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:30,360
right and forget that that the really
interesting thing about how electrons

143
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,029
move in a semiconductor and this is
something that most people won't tell

144
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,560
you it introductory but I think it's
important is that and we're probably a

145
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,250
lot of us familiar with the F equals MA
equation there Newton's second law from

146
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:48,839
from basic physics in free space or in
air to some extent if I put a force on

147
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,110
the particle it will accelerate that
means doesn't just stay the same

148
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:55,800
velocity get faster and faster as long
as I maintain the force right

149
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:00,899
and the same is not true if I get a ball
bearing and try and push it through some

150
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:03,569
honey i can push with a lot of force

151
00:10:03,569 --> 00:10:07,079
what will happen is the ball bearing
will reach terminal velocity through the

152
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:10,859
honey and then if i push it harder it
will actually cavitate the honey around

153
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:14,430
it right it won't actually make the ball
bearing faster and you can verify this

154
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:18,959
and very messy but easy to experiment
and the interesting thing about

155
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,829
electrons in silicon which you need to
get your head down before you truly

156
00:10:22,829 --> 00:10:25,290
understand it is that that is how
electrons moving silicon is the

157
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:28,740
difference between in silicon and just
electrons fired through a vacuum tube

158
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,610
electrons fire through a vacuum tube we
put a force on the Milky be accelerating

159
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:36,480
up to relativistic speeds in Silicon you
put that force on

160
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:39,809
they are moving through honey silicon is
like honey for electrons

161
00:10:39,809 --> 00:10:43,230
ok they are moving through honey they
will reach their terminal velocity

162
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:45,000
straight away and then they just drift

163
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:50,850
we call it drifting that's why we call
it drift and there's a parameter between

164
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:55,079
how much force you put on how fast it
goes called mobility and so higher

165
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:58,529
mobility the first year electrons are
moving right but they're not moving like

166
00:10:58,529 --> 00:11:04,920
in free space where you just accelerate
them and so that's how electrons move

167
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,689
around Silicon and how we move electrons
around Silicon

168
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:11,530
once we want to start making devices
interesting useful devices we need to

169
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,600
think about doping basically what doping
does is it introduces either excess

170
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,590
electrons or excess holes locally into
the silicon so if i replace one soul

171
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,910
come out with a phosphorus atom

172
00:11:21,910 --> 00:11:25,150
I get this phosphorus has five items in
its outer shell

173
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:28,630
so I can ask for we get an extra
electron there I and if i replace it

174
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:32,980
with a boron we get one less electron
there but you think about it one fewer

175
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:38,470
electrons is one extra hole right so the
really interesting thing about silicon

176
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:41,080
is not just that it's a convenient
semiconductor that we can use at

177
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,340
temperatures that we live at

178
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:47,410
but also that you can introduce these
handy other elements which happened to

179
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:51,189
work very well and bond very well into
the silicon lattice which gives extra

180
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,220
carriers either holes are electrons as
you see fit basically now

181
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:57,940
technologically it's very difficult to
drop something below about 10 of the 12

182
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:03,160
per centimeter cubed so pure pure
silicon we can make has something like

183
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:08,020
10 to the 10 impurity atoms per
centimeter cubed which sounds like a lot

184
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,540
but that's a 1 impurity atoms per
hundred billion silicon atoms so it's

185
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:21,069
not that many right but but yet so so
introducing these these dopant atoms

186
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,690
allows us to control the density of
electrons locally in the silicon and

187
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,370
that's very important the most important
thing to understand about how soon as

188
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:33,910
well semiconductor physics is a PN
Junction and i'm recognizing going

189
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:36,520
through this very fast this is to give
you guys if you want to understand this

190
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,270
that there that I I with this was
explained to me in undergraduate physics

191
00:12:40,270 --> 00:12:46,510
lat about 10 years ago i just over and I
thought I understood it when I first

192
00:12:46,510 --> 00:12:50,319
told me it and then about six years
later I suddenly realize they understood

193
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:50,860
it

194
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:57,550
uh-huh uh-huh uh-huh don't worry if this
doesn't make sense for an n-type bit of

195
00:12:57,550 --> 00:13:01,150
silicon is just one that has extra
phosphorus in and a p-type is is extra

196
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:01,780
boron

197
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,530
so we have extra electrons on the left
side and extra holes on the right side

198
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:08,680
so imagine you have two blocks of of
stuff

199
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,160
this one has actually electrons in this
one has extra holes in going to put them

200
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,000
together

201
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,260
now this is similar to what happens if I
spray a can of air freshener in the

202
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:17,990
corner of the room

203
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:21,950
really hard by spraying entire kind of
air freshener in the common room at

204
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,880
first

205
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,930
you can't smell the air freshener ok
after a short while these guys here can

206
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:30,439
smell it and eventually everyone can
smell it but the smell gets diluted

207
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,970
that's a process called diffusion and
basically a statistical process if you

208
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:39,589
have a high concentration of anything
like if you put a blob of dye into the

209
00:13:39,589 --> 00:13:43,970
flowing water right at first you can see
the dye just just sort of the color

210
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,130
forming eventually it spread throughout
the entire volume water so electrons in

211
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:52,670
Silicon move in a similar way and that's
because they have this honey like motion

212
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,979
they can't be accelerate around they
drift around so i put a block with extra

213
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:00,050
electrons next to a block with extra
holes

214
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,199
what happens is the electrons start
going towards where there are fewer and

215
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:07,760
the whole start going towards whether
fewer and it collide in the middle and

216
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,339
when the electrons and holes collide
because one is just a gap for the one

217
00:14:10,339 --> 00:14:14,300
that can be combined and and disappear

218
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:18,349
essentially and the electrons don't
disappear physically what's happening is

219
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,000
that electron is falling into that hole

220
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,630
ok so that there's no electrons are
disappearing physically but the effect

221
00:14:23,630 --> 00:14:27,860
of that if these electrons and holes
diffuse into each other and then combine

222
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,589
is that you leave behind

223
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:36,560
unscreened ions on screen nuclei which a
positive right so what's happening is

224
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,310
electrons or holes are diffusing in just
because there's more of them over here

225
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:41,390
and more of them over there

226
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:46,189
they diffuse in towards each other they
re combining and the result that is the

227
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,320
in the center you have an on-screen
sunscreen carrier items and those are

228
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:56,420
screened atoms because they're big fixed
charges cause an electric field an

229
00:14:56,420 --> 00:15:00,829
electric field pushes back on the
carrier's right so the carrier's

230
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:05,300
naturally wanted to fuse in but by
diffusing in the an eyelet 9i elation

231
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,430
causes a field which pushes back

232
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:11,390
it's very complicated but that is the
best idea once you truly understand that

233
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:13,970
you understand everything about
semiconductor physics

234
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,149
that's important I mean there's
obviously people do korea i mean i have

235
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:20,240
a career in this right but that's the
basic idea if you can understand that

236
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,290
give it five years because there's a few
complications but if you can understand

237
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,139
that you you have a grasp on everything

238
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:32,480
that region in the middle where and so
it so obviously the more extra electron

239
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,920
the were here and more extra holes over
here the faster they diffuse and fast

240
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:40,459
they diffuse the more filled it takes to
push them back so you can control the

241
00:15:40,459 --> 00:15:43,368
size of this region by how many
electrons and holes the word that's very

242
00:15:43,369 --> 00:15:43,970
important

243
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:47,569
this region is called a depletion region
and is the most important part of our

244
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:48,649
camera works

245
00:15:48,649 --> 00:15:55,069
so this depletion region has a huge
amount of fixed positive charge and that

246
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:59,358
is create a field especially if I bias
it put a voltage across it so I just

247
00:15:59,359 --> 00:16:03,529
drop an extra electron in there that
electron is going to zoom off to one

248
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:08,119
side depending on which we're about the
voltage in right and that is basically

249
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:13,040
how we collect the electrons in an
imaging sensor we deplete a big volume

250
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:17,569
of semiconductor and then the four times
come in take extra electrons out of

251
00:16:17,569 --> 00:16:21,559
nowhere into that depletion region and
they get sucked up towards where we put

252
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:24,980
the voltage right it's like a vacuum
cleaner

253
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:28,339
once you have a depletion region you can
stick a voltage on it and you can Hoover

254
00:16:28,339 --> 00:16:32,869
those electrons up towards our voltage
and once you can Hoover up electrons in

255
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:38,600
a specially year results manner you have
a camera and hopefully her

256
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,019
that's kind of you can see that I'm
forget the most capacitor the the first

257
00:16:45,019 --> 00:16:48,470
that I'm going on - how you actually
build these things now it's very

258
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,959
important to talk about the ccd for two
reasons

259
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,768
three reasons the first reason is
because it was invented it was invented

260
00:16:54,769 --> 00:16:59,929
first but a successful one was built
first in 1969 ccd chance for

261
00:16:59,929 --> 00:17:01,939
charge-coupled device to see why in a
second

262
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:06,470
the second reason the CD is important is
because these guys won a Nobel Prize for

263
00:17:06,470 --> 00:17:07,579
in 2009

264
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:10,369
certainly the only nobel prize they'll
be one for building image sensors I

265
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:15,349
think along with a guy who was one of
the grandfather's of fiber optic

266
00:17:15,349 --> 00:17:16,339
communications

267
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:21,678
the third reason it's important to talk
about cds is because they are still

268
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:26,419
widely used in scientific applications
for various reasons but they are not

269
00:17:26,419 --> 00:17:30,019
used at all whatsoever in commercial
products anymore

270
00:17:30,019 --> 00:17:34,730
almost done the only commercial CD
vendor left will show you a ccd is sony

271
00:17:34,730 --> 00:17:38,010
and they are shutting down their CC five
in 2018 what are we going to do

272
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:43,830
basically there are reasons for that the
reason why cds and no longer really

273
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:46,710
manufacturer commercially is because if
you look at that diagram the top left

274
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,110
that LCD is constructed you require

275
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:55,020
overlapping bits on the top overlapping
gets there is no other modern IC

276
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,770
integrated circuit technology that
requires those overlaps so modern see

277
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:02,220
most fathers just cannot do the overlaps
they could do if they threw a few

278
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:05,220
billion dollars on it but why if you're
only doing CD

279
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:11,220
so what we actually have nowadays is a
thing called a CMOS active pixel sensor

280
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:16,200
which is it works similarly i'm going to
explain that but it's slightly different

281
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,380
on the left you have power ccd is
constructed on the right you have how an

282
00:18:19,380 --> 00:18:24,330
ApS is constructed in FPS you have a
readout in every pixel in a ccd you just

283
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:27,000
have one read out and we should for
electrons towards i'm going to describe

284
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,850
that CD is important

285
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,899
the way it works is we have buckets
these capacitors like I said input

286
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,940
voltage across above the depletion
region

287
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:42,330
you can suck electrons up and if we have
a raise of of gates we can turn this one

288
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:46,139
on six electrons are here and we can
turn this one on and turn this one off

289
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:48,030
the electrons are now here

290
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:55,020
so a CTA is very much like those games
where you have board of wood and magnet

291
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,790
under it and like a ball bearing or disk
on the top and you can move the magnet

292
00:18:59,790 --> 00:19:03,420
under under the under the wood and it
moves the ball bearing around on the top

293
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:06,930
that's exactly how it's easy works but
with electrons and with voltage

294
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,890
so what happens is we build a big array
of these capacitors have called on West

295
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:15,810
capacitors the four times arrived we buy
us that what part of voltage on it so

296
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:18,659
the electrons get sucked up one of the
capacitors and then we shuffle them out

297
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:23,010
to the edge of the chip where we have a
handy transistor which looks a bit like

298
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,730
that

299
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,960
I'm it looks exactly like that in fact
which was why i was a bit worried about

300
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:31,950
this topic and recorded but never mind
that once all

301
00:19:31,950 --> 00:19:37,590
yeah don't tell anyone right so how the
CC the output works basically is shuffle

302
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,520
is charged along to your output you drop
it on a capacitor and a capacitor in

303
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:46,620
silicon is just a bit of n-type on the
better p-type and to default me to tell

304
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:51,030
you how well it works but and if you
remember how a capacitor works

305
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:57,210
I'm q equals C times V charge equals
capacitance voltage right so we stick a

306
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:58,680
voltage on the capacitor

307
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:02,610
this is very delicate process it's not
easier than making it sound but you drop

308
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,310
a bit of charge into it that voltage
will change

309
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:09,149
ok so it's as simple as that you drop
some charge in the capacitor by

310
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:13,860
shuffling along the voltage on the
capacitor changes and then we tie that

311
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:20,310
voltage very ever so gently into the
gate of a MOSFET and once you've got the

312
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:23,790
gate of a MOSFET a correct voltage you
can just have a huge amount of current

313
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,750
through the other side of the MOSFET and
you've now got a solid signal is

314
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:33,300
amplified if you just try to put a
hundred electrons through a wire which

315
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:36,000
is what comes out of a ccd low light
conditions

316
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,910
you're not gonna have a good time
because a hundred electrons would you

317
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,870
get instantly wiped out by thermal
currents in the wire

318
00:20:42,870 --> 00:20:46,530
so the most difficult part of actually
building these things engineering-wise

319
00:20:46,530 --> 00:20:49,889
is to get those delicate few hundred
electrons that you've collected ever so

320
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:54,960
carefully in these buckets drop in the
capacitor and couple into a big meaty

321
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,250
mosfet or other power transistors are
available but not I'm telling you now

322
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:04,350
they're almost but that that can get
that can really drive some current

323
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:07,230
through and then we just measure the
voltage and so now we know the voltage

324
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,140
we measure out the other side of those
there that MOSFET is related to its not

325
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,440
generally exactly proportional to but
related to how many electrons we dropped

326
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:17,880
in the capacitor right

327
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,970
this is a capacitor into the game or
spare current comes through measure the

328
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:23,970
voltage tell you how many electrons you
had a very simple

329
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:30,830
a few extra details to build a fall
image sensor might want to color one

330
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,610
I don't know why you might do a home and
and to do that what you do is you just

331
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:38,449
have neighboring pixels which have
optical filters on top of the red green

332
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:44,059
and blue in a patent which is a North
common was called a bear Parton and so

333
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,210
there's all sorts of interesting
algorithms or how you turn this into a

334
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:50,120
proper color image because you actually
only got one image is red one is green

335
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:56,870
one is blue and but underneath that
works exactly the same way so far what

336
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,969
I've said is is you know how these
things work

337
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:03,440
there are obviously difficult even
actually designing the thing if you are

338
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,850
someone who wants to design a camera
chip a sensor chip for very kind of of

339
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:14,779
optical stuff you have to be concerned
about getting those photons absorbed now

340
00:22:14,779 --> 00:22:20,299
silicon is not that reflective as you
can see they're actually a foreign army

341
00:22:20,299 --> 00:22:23,690
is it's about half of the photons you
fire on it bounced straight back

342
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,990
so you've got to sort that out somehow
you don't wanna lose half the light

343
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,159
before you start we use that with the
thing called anti-reflection coatings

344
00:22:31,159 --> 00:22:33,710
which a black magic and no one has a
clue how they work

345
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:37,879
the other thing you gotta be concerned
about is if you want a camera that can

346
00:22:37,879 --> 00:22:40,998
detect very well in the red or the
infrared

347
00:22:40,999 --> 00:22:44,690
you can't go too far into the infrared
because once you below the bandgap you

348
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:50,629
just won't be throwing any electrons
across at all but a the absorption depth

349
00:22:50,629 --> 00:22:54,230
in Silicon that means how far for time
travel through silicon before it on

350
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:59,240
average gets absorbed in infrared starts
to get out into the centimeters and

351
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,529
near-infrared so if you want something
that can see infra red you want a big

352
00:23:03,529 --> 00:23:07,490
thick piece of silicon and to give you
some context by really really thick

353
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:11,059
i'm talking about a hundred microns huh
but that's a lot thicker than most other

354
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:16,399
types of chips your phone camera is
typically four or five microns of active

355
00:23:16,399 --> 00:23:21,139
silicon which will get the Blues nicely
gets the reasonable Reds nicely

356
00:23:21,139 --> 00:23:24,769
one trick that you can do this was
started to be done in the nineteen

357
00:23:24,769 --> 00:23:28,549
nineties is basically build your chip is
normal which is the left picture their

358
00:23:28,549 --> 00:23:32,840
front illuminated the problem with that
is especially on a CMOS chip you have

359
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,459
layers of metal on top of the silicon so
you got silicon dioxide layer 6 layers

360
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:38,809
of metal sometimes

361
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:42,470
and in between those other oxide layers
the problem with that is if you've ever

362
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:47,240
looked at a sheet of aluminium you'll
notice it's not very transparent so even

363
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,789
a very thin sheet of all my name is not
very transparent more sports don't get

364
00:23:49,789 --> 00:23:55,190
through it and we're talking about 20 or
30 nanometers thick typically I'm so

365
00:23:55,190 --> 00:24:00,620
what you can do simply it's not simple
and but in principle is simple you make

366
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:05,689
your chip is normal you are you you
flick it off the way from Silicon flip

367
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,909
it over put in the package that way

368
00:24:07,909 --> 00:24:12,649
and hey presto now your fault zones are
just seeing silicon and very simple idea

369
00:24:12,649 --> 00:24:16,969
they thought of it in the seventies but
it took 20 years to actually build one

370
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:21,710
that works at all but if you do that you
instantly get a huge boost in in in both

371
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,710
the blue and the red on on how much
light you can capture

372
00:24:25,970 --> 00:24:30,230
yes ok however time no file

373
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:35,869
yeah . so interestingly there is a
process related to pass on statistics

374
00:24:35,869 --> 00:24:38,240
which is actually very simple process to
talk about it to anyone who's interested

375
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,549
where you can calibrate your camera and
electrons

376
00:24:40,549 --> 00:24:45,200
you can always calibrate any camera in
units of electrons and that's because

377
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,220
their quantum mechanical particles and
they are subject to force on statistics

378
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:52,490
so you must apply some statistics with
what the numbers you are seeing you can

379
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:56,869
calibrate it in electrons so i can take
a camera that camera with a bit of

380
00:24:56,869 --> 00:24:59,928
messing around providing get the role
pixel out but and tell you how many

381
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,450
electrons and therefore how many photons
arrive . it

382
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:06,139
that's like this is incredible and this
is how modern astronomy works

383
00:25:06,139 --> 00:25:09,139
it's kind of a dirty little secret but
that's how you do absolute like

384
00:25:09,139 --> 00:25:13,158
measurements nowadays so I thought that
was interesting i just go for a couple

385
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:16,789
of bits is on the bottom left is a
picture wire work now I'm not in this

386
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:21,049
picture thankfully because the
handwriting is a choices and we're

387
00:25:21,049 --> 00:25:22,470
working on we work on

388
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,380
outlets silicon strap detectors about
where some of them with their without a

389
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:31,559
big particle physics experiments you're
not generally concerned about the light

390
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:35,399
particles you concerned about big
honking great like neutrons and new ones

391
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,350
and stuff i have mass and their can just
bust blast through a piece of silicon

392
00:25:40,350 --> 00:25:44,428
like a bullet through but of MDF and
just dump a huge amount of charge into

393
00:25:44,429 --> 00:25:49,350
the silicon instead of just one electron
44 visible forth on

394
00:25:49,350 --> 00:25:53,010
but after you've done that the principle
of collecting it

395
00:25:53,010 --> 00:25:57,030
stocking up from the depletion region
reading out by dumping on capacitor is

396
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:59,428
identical to the camera your phones

397
00:25:59,429 --> 00:26:02,280
you've got to be a bit concerned about
radiation damage because you basically

398
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:05,850
putting a thing with the NGO speeding
train through these hundreds of times a

399
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:09,030
second so it's a bit more difficult but
that's how that works

400
00:26:09,030 --> 00:26:15,960
medical imaging things like the many
pics sensor which we also work on is

401
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:18,990
interesting that doesn't use silicone
that use a thing called the mercury

402
00:26:18,990 --> 00:26:22,650
cadmium telluride normally which is
which is a different semiconductor and

403
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:27,179
it turns out if you bond a semiconductor
to a bit of silicon

404
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,820
so you do the readout on this bit of
silicon you do the collection on that

405
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:34,139
but a silicon you can optimize both
separately and get much nicer images and

406
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:38,909
finally the but I were closest on is the
LST camera is a 3.2 megapixel camera

407
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:44,669
consisting of 21 sets of three by three
cds each of which is 4000 x 4000 pixels

408
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:47,250
so it is quite large

409
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:50,429
it's about 5 foot 5 tall

410
00:26:50,429 --> 00:26:54,900
that's the the focal plane of the camera
is about 5 foot 5 tall the block down

411
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:59,340
and about my is a pork on a guy who
designed it or at least designed the

412
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:01,080
focal plane sensors part of it

413
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:06,658
these are done with cds because CD

414
00:27:06,659 --> 00:27:09,690
we've been making it for 30 years
they're nice and linear you can make

415
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:14,760
them very thick 300 microns if you want
and they collect electrons beautifully

416
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:19,650
and that will do and thank you very much
if anyone to talk to about any of this

417
00:27:19,650 --> 00:27:23,630
anytime I more than welcome to chat
about it

418
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:28,070
yeah
