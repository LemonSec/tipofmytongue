1
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,550
thank you

2
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:15,940
thank you and thank you simon so this is
like no Punk so many things to do with

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,720
Lego

4
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,140
so what do we really mean by lego punk
what is it that's important what's

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:25,720
interesting so first of all let's go
Punk is that anything that Lego would

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:30,310
not be happy with and by lego I mean
Lego the company not like the bricks

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:34,629
the bricks are not sentient they can't
all have feelings so if the Lego company

8
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:36,220
does not prove or something

9
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:40,060
I want to hear about it if the company
would never do it i want someone else to

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:42,130
do it that's a good thing in my book

11
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:45,820
the second ball of lego punk is well
that's it really

12
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,899
anything that annoys Lego is good by me
so or anything that I wouldn't do or

13
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:55,989
can't do or shouldn't do so like a punk
isn't this it might have a punk

14
00:00:55,989 --> 00:00:59,709
aesthetic but it's still a big lump of
bricks

15
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,969
it's not this it might be modern art to
somebody

16
00:01:03,969 --> 00:01:07,930
to me it's a pile of bricks to me
something is impressive would be

17
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:08,710
something

18
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:14,080
well getting closer David I'll used to
have a page in the LEGO Club magazine

19
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,789
back in the early eighties and every
issue he would build something big and

20
00:01:18,790 --> 00:01:23,890
impressive like this big impressive Lego
is good if you've done it yourself from

21
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:25,600
your own money in your own funds

22
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,619
David love was paid by the Lego company
to build these models too . the toy

23
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,300
shops in order to sell more lego so as
such a little bit of a corporate shill

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:40,810
lovely guy made lovely models but not
like a punk is about if lego pump does

25
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,080
big stuff then this is the sort of pics
if we want to do

26
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,090
well one that is the Millennium Falcon
that is sitting in ducky butt docking

27
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,970
bay 94 and you can see the scale

28
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:59,320
that's the rest of the Tatooine set they
have also built also to the same scale

29
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:06,130
yeah i am not quite sure how much they
spend on that but that's pretty

30
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:12,250
impressive by anyone's book i would say
these if you if we look at the top right

31
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:15,489
you can see the Millennium focus on some
storm troopers

32
00:02:15,489 --> 00:02:20,950
those are many fix they are this size me
fix if I had them into the light that

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:25,450
that scene that docking bay 94 scene is
all built to scale to these mini fix

34
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:31,099
that gives you a further idea on how
enormous that set is and this is

35
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,379
something people are built with their
own cash

36
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:41,268
it's not the biggest obviously that is
that is a life-size genuine lego x-wing

37
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:47,180
they actually modeled each of the Lego
bricks is sort of a larger size and then

38
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,870
they built the traditional ago x-wing @
real scale

39
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:55,700
I have no clue how you know it's
probably online you can find out how

40
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,760
much it costs but it's a serious piece
of engineering

41
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,209
we just think of the weight and the
transportation of that device that's

42
00:03:02,209 --> 00:03:04,310
impressive piece of work

43
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:11,480
what else well the x-wing didn't fly but
that card does drive there were videos

44
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:14,480
online at this thing trolling down the
road

45
00:03:15,079 --> 00:03:19,310
that's impressive that's also pretty
impressive

46
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,450
the iOS album for those that like that a
lot of the rings films

47
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,069
you'll recognize that that's not a still
or a small model

48
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,480
this is it to scale that's the guy that
built it

49
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,810
here's a geek as you can probably tell
because he's he's got a funny glasses a

50
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:39,079
funny beard and a black t-shirt
expressing my individuality like all

51
00:03:39,079 --> 00:03:42,889
geeks - because of course I don't have
funny bid all funny glasses are wait I

52
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,290
didn't realize where i was going with
that joke

53
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:50,209
so that is life size but not only is it
life-sized look at the detail on the top

54
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:51,170
light

55
00:03:51,170 --> 00:03:55,250
it's not just a big model for the sake
of being big it is detailed every single

56
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,900
north is their sizes and everything

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:05,630
this is not built with 31 bricks I think
roughly and still looks pretty good you

58
00:04:05,630 --> 00:04:10,099
can still Express a moose head on a wall
in 31 bricks

59
00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:14,630
that's elegance that's really quite
impressive of course you can go lower if

60
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:21,858
you like anyone recognize what that is
not bad

61
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,910
of course there's always that one as
well if you have a few more bricks

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,090
depends how many bricks you got home so
it doesn't matter how many bricks you

63
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,460
have lots of lots or not very beautiful

64
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:34,460
you can always do something a little bit
different and interesting

65
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,500
or you could build nuclear accelerator
things this is the head

66
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,480
I'm Collider from CERN build a Lego
unlike the car we saw earlier this one

67
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,490
it's not functional

68
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:53,210
unless you Sheldon Cooper then it
probably was also things that Lego would

69
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,469
not do they would not do guns they know
they put little toy guns and they put

70
00:04:57,470 --> 00:04:59,660
off spaceman way guns things in their
set

71
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:03,020
they would never build assault rifles
like this for people to play computer

72
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,510
games you want but you might recognize
this from halo

73
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:09,860
as I said it doesn't fire no one will be
silly enough to do a gun that really

74
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:10,580
fires

75
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:17,000
although of course someone has been this
actually does work the handle turns it

76
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,390
hits the hammer and it fixed breaks out

77
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:24,590
it's very unlikely that VLC is going to
work on that display so let me see if I

78
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,669
can just if this doesn't work first time
i'll just give up cause its computers

79
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:31,669
and their silly

80
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,640
ok ok give up there was video clip that
you can see where that have a fix out

81
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,630
Rick's it flicks them out about 10
bricks a second if you can turn the

82
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:46,400
handle fast enough but being plastic
bricks they only hurt if you walk on

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,570
them in bare feet

84
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:50,900
so you don't have to worry old tick by
the way if you pair with kids that love

85
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:54,229
Lego and the kid won't clear the lack of
away just says that's fine

86
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,860
will turn out the lights and we'll walk
barefoot into your bottom

87
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:07,139
if you wanna do something away from the
bricks break the mold

88
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,190
this is built by vacuum forming so all
you need is a block of wood shape it too

89
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,400
many fake cover it in wax and put on a
vacuum for machine

90
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,789
if your school at university you
probably have access to one of these if

91
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:22,979
you don't you can do smaller versions
you can obviously by the silicon trees

92
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:25,889
like this they're available in various
stores and fill them with chocolate or

93
00:06:25,889 --> 00:06:26,699
ice

94
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:30,540
there's also a moldable plastic you can
get in DIY and we'll make a stores and

95
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:34,320
map then I think sell them where you got
little plastic beads which when you

96
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,900
place them into hot water or in a bag
and hot water

97
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,698
they become malleable which means you
can imprint a minifig into the malleable

98
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:46,530
plastic so when it calls you then have
your own chocolate tray so you can

99
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:51,929
either make your own trade like this or
larger clicks like this or even fill it

100
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:58,500
with jelly or ice water to make ice
cubes for number seven

101
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,460
design your own if you don't want to pay
lots of money for a harry potter chess

102
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:06,840
set or a lego star wars chess set design
your own pieces

103
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,700
it's quite an interesting exercise of
creative design to come up with a way of

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:16,710
expressing King green bishops nights and
works and pawns with the pieces you

105
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:21,419
actually have a home of course if you do
have enough money you can build this

106
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:22,349
chess set

107
00:07:22,349 --> 00:07:28,020
you can tell that guy is actually sort
of my size he's not a midget

108
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,030
he is actually sitting in a real-life
chessboard each of those pieces as a

109
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,609
lego mindstorms unit inside it

110
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:41,699
they all connect to the pc sat in front
of him which you then use to play a game

111
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,720
of chess

112
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,940
the patterns on the tiles indicate which
toilet is the piece knows that it's

113
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,410
moved to the right location

114
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,800
it's impressive but I've never seen it
work

115
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,810
I have my doubts and you can see why I
have my doubts if you look at the size

116
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,800
of the pieces

117
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,889
there's not enough room between them for
the night to get between them

118
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:06,150
that's that's what I'm not sure but your
mileage may vary

119
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:12,450
oh yeah I had this really great idea for
promoting the lego Punk's i thought i'll

120
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,820
do a QR code in Lego no one more

121
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:20,340
ever thought of doing a QR code in Lego
two seconds in google this comes up it

122
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,219
might work i don't know where it goes by
the way so no one click it might be a

123
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,150
dodgy site

124
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:27,060
not that i have dodgy sights on my
machine obviously I friend did this for

125
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:29,580
me but it might actually work

126
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:32,760
what about other signs

127
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,479
you could use your calendar you could
even program lego mindstorms to

128
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,080
reprogram the Lego bricks on the
calendar filled for you

129
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,410
you could also if you do 1200 if you're
a developer doing travel stuff you could

130
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:47,310
use a lego as you travel aboard at least
get stops giving money to 3m for their

131
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,329
post it notes

132
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:54,300
there i fixed it i have no idea if that
would actually stop a cave from falling

133
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,170
in

134
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,680
but it does look like a thumbs up so
maybe it does

135
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:04,800
mathematics is there a limit of
mathematicians in you could probably

136
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,790
tell me what the name of that function
is i don't remember i didn't research it

137
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:11,849
but what's interesting about this is
that's a continuous function

138
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:17,219
Lego blocks are discreet which means it
actually takes a lot more effort than

139
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:21,210
you think to make what appears to be a
nice smooth shape of a lot of jagged

140
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:24,090
Lego bricks will see more curves later

141
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:27,300
11 pictures are possible

142
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,990
this is one of those cases where those
at the back have a better advantage than

143
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,840
those at the front because you're the
only one who'll probably realize the

144
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:37,380
picture on the left is the same as the
picture on the right if you're in the

145
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:37,950
front

146
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:41,490
take your glasses off squint or you know
look through your fingers

147
00:09:41,490 --> 00:09:47,520
that is actually a portrait of tutorials
in Lego now of course as anyone that

148
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,699
does graphics to know the more pixels
you have the more bricks you have the

149
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,680
better resolution you have how many more
pixels you need about thirty thousand

150
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,489
yep

151
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:04,440
again the guy laying next to it is my
size that's a lot of bricks and only is

152
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,440
that a little bricks and boy does he
have a lot of time on his hands

153
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:11,790
if you look on the top right of the
picture you can see see two life-size

154
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:15,599
statues that he's building at the same
time as this one

155
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,880
he has enough bricks for both of them at
once then you ever dare tell your kids

156
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,880
they have too much Lego

157
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:28,250
of course if you don't have enough to
let go you could always make a smaller

158
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,240
version of Elvis

159
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:32,960
that's pretty much a 2d sculpture is
virtually a port rate there's no real

160
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:35,750
meaning of the depth of it but if you do
have enough bricks

161
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:39,110
you can build a 3d sculpture version of
Elvis uh huh

162
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,750
and if you've got even more books that
that Elvis by the way is about yay high

163
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:50,360
it's not that big but if you have again
more bricks make it life-sized ish these

164
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:55,550
two won a competition to have their
their their bodies being cast in Lego

165
00:10:55,550 --> 00:11:00,199
and all these pics you see here are you
know standard LEGO bricks

166
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,440
one thing you'll you may not be aware is
that these are actually Hollow

167
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,880
most of these big three sculptures are
Hollow although lego can support its own

168
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,510
weight

169
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:11,720
it's best not to it can be a little bit
temperamental there's gonna be a metal

170
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,080
pole through the middle and other spoke
to hold everything in place and if

171
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:17,600
you've been to legoland you'll probably
notice that all the bricks are glued

172
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,260
together and coated in varnish just to
stop a little bit some cracking up here

173
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,290
and there but always nice build

174
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:33,020
he even if you're not a builder and your
photographer there is an entire movement

175
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,069
in the legos space which is to reimagine
photographs

176
00:11:37,070 --> 00:11:44,030
album covers historic events in Lego the
Tiananmen Square tanks

177
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,420
there is a LEGO version of that there's
a LEGO version of this there's a LEGO

178
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,760
version of the guys set on the
skyscraper beam

179
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:56,270
I mean with Lego i can get I can see how
that happens but in the real version

180
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:59,329
the guy at the end he's having his lunch
break if you need to pee I'd have no

181
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:00,740
idea how they're going to move

182
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:04,430
I said we get back to curves

183
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:08,479
the curve is probably one of the more
difficult things to making lego because

184
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,890
we use the Lego bricks being blocks and
we used two curves being well not blocks

185
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:17,599
so once you can build curves which you
can go to Ball you're halfway there to

186
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,160
be a professional Lego builder

187
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,420
if you look carefully at the dome and
the 134 were probably able to see this

188
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,339
the studs are pointing this way that way
and that way throughout the course of

189
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,720
the dome that actually gives it a much
smoother feel and that's quite a complex

190
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,950
thing to achieve this is a smaller
version of the same thing

191
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:41,990
again that ball fits in the palm of your
hand but it's still a hundred and thirty

192
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:46,280
Lego bricks and they have to be exactly
the white Lego bricks as well because if

193
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:49,910
they're not you can't make it at the
bottom there are pieces which hanging

194
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,420
underneath everything else if they're
not the right shape there's nothing for

195
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:59,569
them hang onto and therefore therefore
yeah as soon as someone makes a ball you

196
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:01,880
can be guaranteed someone like a death
star

197
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,180
well I haven't finished this one so you
know never mind

198
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:10,939
probably the second death star insert
your Star Wars jokes here so you can

199
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:15,080
bend the walls and I said that purposely
if you look carefully at least spokes

200
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:19,190
you'll actually see that each of those
spikes is it such as a curve

201
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:23,210
it's not staggered bricks the bricks
have been very very slightly and with

202
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:26,780
enough bricks are very small bend turns
into a complete been that you can see

203
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,050
there if you don't have so many breaks
the benz look like this

204
00:13:30,590 --> 00:13:34,070
they still look like Ben Lego bricks but
you can see the gaps especially in the

205
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:38,720
bottom of the yellow but it's still
viable and it's still worth looking at

206
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:42,740
of course if boring curved shapes are
not your thing

207
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:48,650
any positions in the audience we don't
know we got a couple out like that so

208
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:49,040
yeah

209
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,740
what why not just build something is
impossible like a proper magician would

210
00:13:51,740 --> 00:14:00,200
all this one two studs from the front
five starts in the fun and only one

211
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:06,860
crossbeam very easy to make this or if
you do have some time on your hands you

212
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,210
can make issues waterfall

213
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:11,990
pay careful attention to where the
waterfall ends and the path of the water

214
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:17,360
going back up to the top if you go
online you can find how this is our

215
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,500
secret works

216
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:25,070
22 real world now when I was growing up
I couldn't afford to take a USB stick

217
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:28,520
smash it to bits just to put it into a
lego brick that when he could have pop

218
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,500
now again they're giving away free

219
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:34,010
so all you need to do take a little
break hollow it out with a small drill

220
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:38,870
stick USB stick in there and you've got
a thing if you don't want to use USB use

221
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:47,360
LEDs make your own little torches LED
battery up and take me or if you want to

222
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,340
get some bigger entire VR unit and it
probably still sell

223
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:58,570
better than the v5 so go see if you've
got some aluminium or any Americans in

224
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,050
the order aluminum you can make yourself
a little keeping such as this

225
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,800
if you don't have any of that so if
you're not a university or whatever you

226
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:09,219
can use that malleable plastic i
mentioned earlier and instead of using a

227
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:13,090
jelly mould jelly in a mold you could
you solder in that mold

228
00:15:13,090 --> 00:15:17,050
it's not very solid it is very soft but
Italy it means you can do it at home

229
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,069
without an aluminium smelt all 34

230
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:26,710
Jewelry jewelry is something that is
very easy to make fairly cheap to make a

231
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:30,520
lot of the cases and fairly unique your
tie clip here

232
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,180
i paid a whole ninety nine pence for a
diamond stud eat i click to be shipped

233
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,109
in from China

234
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:39,340
it must be genuine at 99p must be a real
diamond so I just with the time and out

235
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:43,150
like a lego brick over the top and I've
got a tie clip that most people don't

236
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,870
have the most people but it wouldn't
want but for the purpose of the talk it

237
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:48,010
serves its purpose

238
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:52,689
it's jewelry is easy to make you can
make the place look again

239
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:56,290
just take six Lego bricks drill a hole
through the middle and attach a piece of

240
00:15:56,290 --> 00:15:58,030
string of elastic around them

241
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,990
there you go if you have a little bit
more time and patience and you've got a

242
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,030
very patient of a half

243
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:08,380
you can have a wedding ring from Lego
yeah

244
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,950
if your partner let you have a wedding
ring made of Lego their keeper

245
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:18,010
there are other forms are available so
we got sunglasses that this is a said

246
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:21,640
that I made myself they are real and
they are sculpted to my face but since

247
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,310
we're recording this and I don't look
any more stupid than I do I won't put

248
00:16:24,310 --> 00:16:24,939
them on

249
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:28,870
take my word for it you'll probably
notice that the yellow is what you get

250
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,170
in the old lego space ships around the
mid eighties spaceship spaceship

251
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,160
spaceship

252
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:37,000
as is the blue the guy on the left

253
00:16:37,510 --> 00:16:40,840
that picture was taken about three years
ago so now they have we have a beard

254
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,840
going down to their stomach and they
probably working Shore bitch

255
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:48,790
so if you want to make stuff you can
make stuff to wear

256
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,980
with the lego mindstorms kits you can
build a lot more of electronic and

257
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:58,850
computer oriented things one of which is
someone who's not a printer technically

258
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,900
it's just a plotter

259
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,079
but essentially a pen goes along and
moving sheet of paper

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,190
the pen is controlled by lego motors the
paper is controlled by lego motors and

261
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:13,190
it draws out messages that you can
create on your pc sticking with the lego

262
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:15,589
mindstorms kit this is the NXT
mindstorms kit

263
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:19,310
this is a Segway it's quite cool because
it's a Segway

264
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:24,440
it's self balancing and it's made from
lego but was more impressive is the guy

265
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,650
that built and demonstrated this only
ever tested it on a flat surface

266
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:32,990
mathematically speaking it should work
on an incline but you'd never tested it

267
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:37,610
and for the developers in the audience
who might something I think it should

268
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:41,360
work but i haven't tested it and then
you test it and it works

269
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:45,439
imagine what this guy felt like when he
tested it for the first time in a group

270
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,660
of 200 geeks and it worked first time

271
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:52,580
it's a night is a very simple but very
impressive piece of coding and building

272
00:17:52,580 --> 00:17:54,590
27

273
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:59,480
it's this is just a projector this is an
old super 8 film

274
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,160
now this is show you the difference
between an MVP in Lego and I was all the

275
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,510
more finished product

276
00:18:05,510 --> 00:18:11,180
essentially a projector is just a light
bulb something to drag a piece of film

277
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:14,690
through the gate and a lens to focus the
image on the screen

278
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:20,870
well if you pull the the film too tight
through the gate will snap you don't

279
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:21,679
want that

280
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:24,890
if you don't pull it tight enough it
will go loose and it won't read through

281
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:30,350
that the frame . so this has a lot of
extra pieces of pulleys and mechanisms

282
00:18:30,350 --> 00:18:34,490
to ensure that the film goes through a
good constant frame rate and doesn't

283
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:42,020
stretch doesn't break it doesn't become
too slack all 28 you can do loaf I this

284
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,700
is the original lego mindstorms and he's
just basically a controlled motor but

285
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:50,960
the reality is there is no more or less
technology in what is being used here

286
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:54,950
than there was in the original
gramophones the gramophone had a motor

287
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:59,840
normal wind-up motor that would spin a
record around and round and there would

288
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:03,320
be a needle that would it will sit in
the groove and will be amplified by the

289
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,100
cone

290
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:04,939
this is all

291
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:07,640
that's doing the Lego is there just to
provide a motor and a constant speed

292
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,390
robots I was

293
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:15,410
I've got so many robots that I've built
I've got so many robots that I've seen

294
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:18,260
I've got something I want to like
posting pictures of there was no way i

295
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:23,600
could pick any particular one or or
small number to show so I decided on

296
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,629
this one which is as you can probably
guess by now a Rubik's Cube solving

297
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:27,380
robot

298
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:31,640
the reason that I like this particular
one is that it's only really the left

299
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,890
and the right hand arms that do anything

300
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:38,690
the camera takes a photograph of the
side feeds it to the first lego

301
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,780
mindstorms unit on the top there on the
on the right hand side

302
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:45,950
once you understand the qubits tries to
solve it the blue thing just move it

303
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:48,980
backwards and forwards and around and
then the kid the hand on the left and

304
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:49,730
the right

305
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:57,110
rotate the slices in the position this
one if anyone hasn't seen it before

306
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:00,889
guess what it does from the picture you
in a cookie is the Antikythera mechanism

307
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:07,430
which was a 2000 year old calendar
computing device when it was discovered

308
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,530
in the see it looked like this

309
00:20:09,530 --> 00:20:14,750
archaeologists computer geeks and random
hangers-on worked out that this was the

310
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:18,890
mechanism and even though it's 2,000
years old it would compute the position

311
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:22,550
of the Sun in the sky at any given time
a day it would compute position the moon

312
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:26,180
phases of the moon eclipse and and
various positions of things in the sky

313
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:30,350
the two thousand years old and looking
like that

314
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:34,760
that's not a bad feet and that's what it
looks like in Lego

315
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:41,658
all 31 arduino you can stick in arduino
into anything

316
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:45,890
this is an instrument I did have an
audio clip which we won't be able to

317
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,750
play but with a piece of resistance wire
stretched across a meter or so of Lego

318
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:54,620
you have a crocodile clip the creative
potential divider circuit in the

319
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:55,668
resistance wire

320
00:20:55,669 --> 00:20:59,659
this is fed into the arduino it converts
this potential difference into a note

321
00:20:59,659 --> 00:21:05,600
and it plays a beeping noise but of
course that's an arduino making the

322
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,260
noise

323
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:11,510
this doesn't make a noise a tool you can
tell it's guitar but the tension on the

324
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:13,940
strings if you were to really put
strings on their the amount of tension

325
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,640
and guitar strings is such that it would
cause that

326
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,409
Lego neck to break even if you were to
put a piece of metal all the way through

327
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:22,340
that neck

328
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,908
the bricks woodlake around the metal and
you still won't be able to play the

329
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:26,600
guitar

330
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,320
if you use nylon strings however you
could make a violin

331
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:35,090
this is playable it even has tuning pegs
if you look to the bottom right which

332
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,408
due to the violin

333
00:21:36,409 --> 00:21:39,980
it's not very tuneful but it does work

334
00:21:40,669 --> 00:21:46,970
the main problem with instruments like
this is because there they are so small

335
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,190
and let go is quite fragile

336
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,600
it means that you can't play real
instruments that require a vibration

337
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,080
because the vibration of the string has
too much attention it would break

338
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,129
so what you need to do is instead of
having a small unit you need to have a

339
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:02,299
large unit

340
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:07,279
this is a life-size harpsichord this
really does play it doesn't sound very

341
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,600
good

342
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:12,889
we do have let me see if I can play this
though this might actually because it's

343
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:15,890
only audio

344
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:21,090
yeah

345
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:29,850
yeah

346
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:33,659
yeah

347
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,710
yeah

348
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:55,270
yeah that's not all but it's also good
considering everything except for those

349
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:00,220
strings a lego where we have to work two
more 33 ok so all 34 next

350
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,630
actually can I switch the other screen
is actually something i do want to try

351
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:05,860
on the other screen is it

352
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:10,149
I didn't seem to have lost the thing i
want to get that on to the main screen

353
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,400
is that coming up can we switch the
thingy

354
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:20,590
okay let me see if I've got upset let me
see if i switch into this computer

355
00:23:20,590 --> 00:23:27,730
if not we'll give it because this
showing everything hardware-based things

356
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:35,890
that you can build with Lego when you're
either building molds so let me see if i

357
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:43,330
can find settings lost it

358
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:50,330
and first mentioned there are a variety
of Licensing structures that are

359
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,990
available

360
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,070
no wait i will talk about some of those
in a bit more detail there we go

361
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:58,760
this is little GTA

362
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:01,250
okay stop it's hammer time

363
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:07,250
now now we will change the rules sweetie
perspective of the defender is now the

364
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:11,330
target even translucent a defender is
not a target and no web you are the

365
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:16,310
defender right to do this that you keep
yourself within the doctor in the target

366
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,960
in that world

367
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,980
ok the defender is now the target and
again in the machines memory you are the

368
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,030
defender

369
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:27,170
the only exception our move so that you
keep yourself between the attacker and

370
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:31,580
the target of me so I had to cheat on
that one but otherwise it's something

371
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:34,580
else you know you can build this stuff
like oh no

372
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,620
yeah

373
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,540
ok one more slide on 434

374
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:47,540
although before we do actually I should
probably point out this other thing

375
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:50,960
everyone's got these massive millennium
focus I've got this little tiny one

376
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,950
Lego don't like you selling instructions
so there's a guy in the states that

377
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:59,510
gives instructions for free but then
sells the bricks because like I can't

378
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:02,540
stop in selling the books but they can't
stop in selling instructions

379
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,870
so even if you need a way around things
there's always around

380
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:12,080
so finally we're up to all 34 does
everyone know what was 34 is now I don't

381
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,590
know at all i've never heard of that no
I'm a good little boy or girl yes

382
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:18,949
yeah well so as I've just been told me
out of time so I can't show you what all

383
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:23,030
34 in Lego looks like but i can say
thank you to the little mini fix that

384
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,420
didn't make this possible that's the
organized and everyone here working at

385
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,940
the backstage behind the big lights

386
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:32,809
I probably got a couple of minutes for
questions if there are any but otherwise

387
00:25:32,809 --> 00:25:35,809
thank you all

388
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:44,889
would anyone like to ask a quick
question do we have any questions in the

389
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:48,218
audience just quickly just quickly just
quickly or shall we turn around

390
00:25:48,219 --> 00:25:55,210
yeah I have one over here here we are
you please put the glasses on

391
00:25:56,919 --> 00:26:03,820
we have a request to put the glasses on
but the glasses on but the class says

392
00:26:09,850 --> 00:26:21,850
and the here and now i have to do that
very gently because these glasses are we

393
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:25,360
all they do have their lenses in and
they don't have their lenses in so i'm

394
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:28,659
very very close to walking off the edge
of the stage and it's actually an

395
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:32,500
amusing little thing I when I first made
them I took them to a London 2600

396
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,890
meeting which just meeting up drinks
talking about this as you normally do

397
00:26:35,890 --> 00:26:38,110
and we ended up going through

398
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,010
Leicester Square and I was wearing these
things because at the time I didn't

399
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:43,658
think I had a reputation to protect

400
00:26:43,659 --> 00:26:47,110
so I'm there looking like an absolute
doofus and a couple of tourists come

401
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,500
over and saying oh they're lego what was
this

402
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,010
so being the people we were instead of
just saying oh we just some friends out

403
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:56,919
with you know it was popping out for
some beers and burgers said I'll know

404
00:26:56,919 --> 00:26:59,380
this is mr. lego he's from Denmark

405
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:04,030
he's doing a tour of London at the
moment so over the next hour I've got my

406
00:27:04,030 --> 00:27:06,760
picture taken by about a thousand
tourists in Leicester Square all

407
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,590
thinking that met mr. Lego

408
00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:12,309
luckily is what this was in the days
before Facebook otherwise that probably

409
00:27:12,309 --> 00:27:16,090
pictures on there and i'll be tagged up
or something but it's surprising how

410
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:21,939
simple a little thing just set you apart
and encourages with strangers in

411
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,840
Leicester Square to come up to you thank
you thank you very much Steven I think

412
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,629
having had the glass is we we can't top
that

413
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:34,870
thank you very much indeed even good
with you
