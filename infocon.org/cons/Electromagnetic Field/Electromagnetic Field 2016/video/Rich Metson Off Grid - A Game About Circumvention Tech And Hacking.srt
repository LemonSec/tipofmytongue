1
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:14,290
this time

2
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,070
it is by rich

3
00:00:16,070 --> 00:00:22,698
we'll be talking about off grades a game
about Sir convention tech and hacking so

4
00:00:22,699 --> 00:00:25,699
enjoy

5
00:00:27,349 --> 00:00:35,809
hi hi thanks for coming down or coming
in or going out the Sun whichever it was

6
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:38,809
and yet my name is rich

7
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:48,379
i'm making a game called off grid which
i will just launched slides for now

8
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:51,379
can you see that great

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:02,809
okay well then as i mentioned before i'm
gonna tell you about video game that and

10
00:01:02,809 --> 00:01:07,880
me and another guy I've been developing
called upgrade its about hacking data

11
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,429
privacy and sir convention tech and
there's a quite a few people from London

12
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,780
tax base and who are usually just around
the MF know me a little while and no no

13
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,450
i've been working on this part time for
quite some time

14
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,689
so why now why why come to MF to talk
right now

15
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:28,429
well earlier this year we managed to
complete enough funding to secure our

16
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,470
alpha release and work on it full time

17
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:37,400
so should be releasing the game sometime
early next year and but a without

18
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:42,470
further ado to give you a little feel
for what the game is like although i'll

19
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:53,060
show you a bit of the animatic intro and
the the demo of it so

20
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,460
hopefully the demo gods are with us as
well this is going to be slightly

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:23,720
trickier because I've got to be able to
see this to click on it to walk right

22
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:36,519
apologies folks this is not very good to
me

23
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,790
yeah can I try extending the displays
after all because I i thought i might be

24
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:46,690
able to keep my eye on this screen from
down there

25
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:52,060
okay we can try that sure

26
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,579
select wanted to display to this might
work

27
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:18,180
can you say that right

28
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:26,160
I think so when we might be okay can you
hear any sound is the next question

29
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:41,400
no well here we go a little bit sound ok
so we can turn that off of it coming

30
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,840
there we go he dad hey come on I'm
hungry

31
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:52,740
yeah coming right up

32
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:56,820
I got you something

33
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:01,410
happy birthday pop oh wow

34
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:05,130
I know they're not the fancy ones but
the OS is open source so you can pretty

35
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,329
much load anything awesome girl oh and
look I set up all your favorite apps so

36
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:13,290
if you turn on Bluetooth they'll come
right up to you to come

37
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,670
yes I see ya

38
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:22,320
just push right here ok I see genius

39
00:04:23,610 --> 00:04:28,260
you mean the world to me darling

40
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:33,090
jane harman you are under arrest

41
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,190
please do not ever since there's been a
mistake what are you doing all right

42
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,320
with you know John

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,320
I'll sort this out stay back

44
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,790
this is a national security letter under
the Official Secrets Act is here by a

45
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:55,090
crime to talk or communicate about this
incident

46
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,109
your daughter will be in processing for
90 days will call you

47
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:02,680
what

48
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:09,800
ok so off grid is is set in the
fictional world or at least it was when

49
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,600
we started making it an early 2013

50
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:18,300
let's go about net neutrality privacy
digital rights people with the same over

51
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:21,990
kind of we're gone british black humor
and irony is going to running through it

52
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:26,640
and deals with saw the pair of
technology and didn't constantly in the

53
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,789
morning and now we're hoping it's also
relatively

54
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:35,780
nice step away from the kind of tropes
and crutches that agriculture is usually

55
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:41,388
arrested on in mainstream media and so
you apply have to dive into this world

56
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:45,020
that you've got no understanding of you
play a kind of a complete technophobe

57
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:52,639
whose daughters the master of this kind
of thing usually looks after him and

58
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,699
essentially some of her friends once
she's been disappeared get in touch with

59
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,849
you to try and help you scale up and
work out how to get back to agree

60
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:05,719
smedley smedley who so I'll skip this
bit

61
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,720
the quarterback

62
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:20,830
so here we go next thing is well the
framerate be I can this big screen

63
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,720
it's ok ok cool so yeah basically we we
want to make something that was kind of

64
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
satirical but not so far distant in the
future and we started in 2013 and have

65
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,400
had to kind of put some of our crazier
ideas back in a little over the last two

66
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,109
years in terms of how surveillance
states of kind of actually got a grip on

67
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:49,000
all of us and how the Internet of Things
seems to be something that everyone with

68
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:53,470
a little five-pound arduino wants to
stick in a teddy bear or whatever else

69
00:06:53,470 --> 00:07:00,040
so we made the game essentially where
these this set of hackers are get in

70
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:03,040
touch with you to try and get you to
work out what's going on

71
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:08,680
and although the frame rate is horribly
jaggi on this screen you can sort of see

72
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:16,360
sort of see that you have this data view
that gives you the ability to get on two

73
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:22,210
different networks and get to the
different bits of data around it so I'll

74
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:25,989
take a quick steps i did go back to my
presentation quickly

75
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:36,569
you see that cool

76
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:43,019
so as I said we wanted to do something
that wasn't too far in the future and in

77
00:07:43,019 --> 00:07:48,360
2013 we had this kind of wacky idea that
we could do a to reason i asked villain

78
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,449
who who was the leader of the state and
absolutely hell-bent on safety for

79
00:07:54,449 --> 00:07:55,860
everyone

80
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,499
don't know how that came about but it
did so yeah

81
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:06,479
consistently along the way we've held
off of being too out there and actually

82
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,909
as a designer I now trying to reel back
being out there because the world is a

83
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:20,399
crazy place is actually running faster
than our own fiction could I item to me

84
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:24,839
out a lot of it so it seems like it's
running the direction of terry gilliam's

85
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:30,209
Brazil so I mean from the perspective of
lots of underwhelming Lee implemented

86
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,949
technology prevalent everywhere

87
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,250
toasters the poor coffee on your
breakfast air conditioning vents that

88
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,448
stop you from leaving the house type
thing and we originally thought that

89
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:42,838
making all the devices in the game
connected to the Internet of Things was

90
00:08:42,839 --> 00:08:47,130
just so crass and so ridiculously
futuristic that people wouldn't believe

91
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:54,750
it but lo and behold the real world
outpacing us for instance slow cookers

92
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:05,490
running linux because hackers need BB q
beef to be able to ssh into so the

93
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:10,620
original notion was to make a game about
data privacy and the modern world means

94
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:15,149
that that means by default trying to
cloak or hide yourself online or even

95
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,600
not interacting in a way that produces
data

96
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,790
I thought from a game perspective were
hiding covering your tracks reducing

97
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:31,290
visibility I then let's make stuff game
and let's put a twist on it or using

98
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:34,290
kind of the traditional hacking genre

99
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:40,049
but let's place it in 3d and physical
eyes the data

100
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:45,749
i'm actually going to switch over again
because i can't hold both let me make

101
00:09:45,749 --> 00:09:53,039
the dates are into a kind of physical
breadcrumb trail so understanding and

102
00:09:53,039 --> 00:09:58,529
privacy and vulnerabilities and the
ultimate are ultimately surveillance sir

103
00:09:58,529 --> 00:10:02,129
convention seemed to us to be something
people had a hard time grasping because

104
00:10:02,129 --> 00:10:03,089
it's invisible

105
00:10:03,089 --> 00:10:07,949
so we aren't making data physical would
help with that as well as make for a

106
00:10:07,949 --> 00:10:12,569
good game mechanics at the time it
seemed like an obscure subject and i am

107
00:10:12,569 --> 00:10:17,399
talking about at the time that we first
consider doing this in 2013 and then

108
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:18,179
overnight

109
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:25,049
we were actually showing one of our
first very rough prototypes on a little

110
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:29,489
games stream with a guardian journalist
and that same week

111
00:10:29,489 --> 00:10:34,619
Snowden broke is his first leaked and it
became something that everyone in the

112
00:10:34,619 --> 00:10:41,459
main public was aware of sorry

113
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:47,998
so essentially we wanted to make a game
that doesn't preach to the converted but

114
00:10:47,999 --> 00:10:51,329
actually explores these issues to the
wider gaming public so I'm sort of

115
00:10:51,329 --> 00:10:54,689
speaking to the choir here and I know
that most of you guys probably shaking

116
00:10:54,689 --> 00:11:00,839
your heads at this these these kinds of
issues for quite some time longer off

117
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:04,259
grid is an opportunity to take those
abstract concepts of data and privacy

118
00:11:04,259 --> 00:11:08,789
and manipulation and social engineering
and and physical eyes them get the

119
00:11:08,789 --> 00:11:12,539
player to explore on a very basic level
some of the info SEC techniques you can

120
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:18,389
use to navigate that world safely in our
view and I think most people have you

121
00:11:18,389 --> 00:11:20,849
experienced something is better than
being told it

122
00:11:20,849 --> 00:11:24,209
so to some extent we want to give
players the opportunity to vicariously

123
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:26,939
experience being totally surveilled

124
00:11:26,939 --> 00:11:30,959
although maybe they've already got a
feel for that and invading the privacy

125
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,059
of others to try and realize what it
would mean in their real lives and who

126
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:39,179
knows this could also be a way of
engaging people to take a step towards

127
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,959
trying out what can be very very
intimidating set of tools when it comes

128
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,099
to things like a GP or tool

129
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:49,990
but as a tldr basically we want to make
dates are real and something you could

130
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:51,370
play with

131
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:57,850
so the basic level structure kind of
goes like this

132
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:05,530
gain access to a building then scan the
network to gain access crack or socially

133
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:08,530
engineer your way into just different
levels of the networks in the building

134
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:15,520
use personal day to you find on those
networks to manipulate the behavior of

135
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:20,650
NPCs to move them out of the way and
avoid discovery essentially pranking and

136
00:12:20,650 --> 00:12:25,090
spoofing increasingly funny ways you
kind of playing chess with the NPC's

137
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:32,590
using their data then your main target
objective in each level is to exfiltrate

138
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:37,540
some kind of sensitive data the on some
of the machines in the building to help

139
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:40,390
build an image of the case against your
daughter and why she might have been

140
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:46,900
disappeared and then get up to the roof
set up a mesh network now delete the

141
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:51,400
information across the network because
in this fictional world the idea of an

142
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:57,430
open internet isnt is an increasingly
distant memory and finally don't get

143
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:58,209
caught

144
00:12:58,210 --> 00:13:03,010
so we wanted to set up so that at all

145
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:07,660
Onion Routing like mechanic where you as
the player had to be careful in what way

146
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:10,089
in how many times you access the
networks

147
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,120
so as to avoid being traced

148
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,400
we started with the basics of needing to
essentially clear your logs as you move

149
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:24,520
through the environment and this is
evolved into simulating all of these

150
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:27,550
networks in a more realistic manner

151
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,599
scanning them and so we're hoping to
build it up so that you sort of scan the

152
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,660
environment with a showdown style app or
API call that exposes the open ports on

153
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:42,459
all of the Internet of Things objects
around around the levels anything left

154
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:46,870
with its default password anything like
that and connect to those different

155
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:50,890
devices by tagging them each device that
you find and tagged you can build up a

156
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,460
proxy chain and so extend the amount of
time that you can sit in the network

157
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,720
without being traced back

158
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,720
which gives you more time to do fun
things like hack

159
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,709
so essentially finding an opening
vulnerable devices extend your powers

160
00:14:05,709 --> 00:14:12,069
and I've i put in comical laughs but
maybe not right

161
00:14:12,579 --> 00:14:17,319
so you've got a set of tools that give
you the ability to see this date so as

162
00:14:17,319 --> 00:14:24,819
you can see in the lower left hand
corner and you basically a you can see

163
00:14:24,819 --> 00:14:29,139
the bread crumb of of data that other
characters are leaving behind and data

164
00:14:29,139 --> 00:14:32,949
is actually generated by characters
personalities and and we've kind of

165
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:38,500
integrated a and another layer of Lewis
scripting so our previously was actually

166
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:44,319
xml but each day is driven by a kind of
personality that defines his behavior

167
00:14:44,319 --> 00:14:48,310
and therefore how he can be pushed in
different directions with different

168
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:55,060
pieces of data each device you gain
access to can also receive this data and

169
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:59,739
be manipulated so data can have an
effect by modifying a device's behavior

170
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:04,629
based on what it's received or modifying
that data and using the permissions that

171
00:15:04,629 --> 00:15:07,750
device has within the network to send it
on to somewhere else

172
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,059
AKA another device that you didn't have
access to before you then use this to

173
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:16,480
find other data that contains passwords
keys

174
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,680
private information hide your own data
and move your adversaries out of their

175
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,758
usual patrol routes so that you can
sneak through levels and get to your

176
00:15:24,759 --> 00:15:25,809
goals

177
00:15:25,809 --> 00:15:31,959
so essentially collecting data is the
name of the game for all of the above

178
00:15:31,959 --> 00:15:36,758
reasons for instance on a character that
you need to gain access to you should be

179
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:40,959
able to collect their data and build up
a kind of profile or a contextual map of

180
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:44,559
them and then use that as a dictionary
to speed up the time you need to brute

181
00:15:44,559 --> 00:15:47,559
force their passwords on machines that
you've identified of theirs

182
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,880
but just collecting interesting data and
sending it to an npc you can have an

183
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,350
interesting effect two

184
00:15:54,350 --> 00:16:02,060
so why would that be well i started to
touch on this idea of npc I having these

185
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,920
these behaviors and personalities that
drive drive them and the reason that's

186
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,670
interesting is we we've implemented a
version of google app which is

187
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:16,459
goal-oriented action planning for our I
i I'm it essentially means you can throw

188
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:20,480
new actions at the eye and they will
find the best way to use those actions

189
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,120
in order to get to their objectives

190
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,529
this allows us to kind of throw quite
interesting things that I on the fly and

191
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:32,660
they will either do interesting funny
things or silly things or fall over or

192
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:36,020
whatever else which we're now when
you're making a non-violent game about

193
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:39,020
manipulating a character behavior it's
quite useful

194
00:16:39,589 --> 00:16:45,140
potentially we may even be able to move
some of the elements of the eye over to

195
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:50,750
lure so that the players in the modding
tools that we're providing can write

196
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:54,080
their own behaviour for the eye as well
and I'll get to the bottom side of it

197
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:54,920
soon

198
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:02,089
so to summarize with some examples we've
started making fun little hacks in the

199
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:06,800
gameplay like sending soda machine adds
to a guard whose profile describes him

200
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,079
as caffeine addict to distract him off
route exfiltrating compromising personal

201
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:16,369
data from the guards phone and sending
it to the printers or the tvs nearby to

202
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:22,760
make him Russian blush scanning a smart
TV listening for voice commands that

203
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:26,780
accidentally picked up the head of
it's-- conversations storing admin

204
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:29,149
passwords in the clear

205
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,370
turning smart light bulbs on and off and
then remotely turning thermostats up to

206
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:37,729
38 degrees to cover body temperature so
that you can move through a dark room

207
00:17:37,730 --> 00:17:42,590
without the thermal camera seeing you
but we're hoping that the players will

208
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:45,980
be able to find new and interesting ways
to change these data and device

209
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:51,230
interactions in complex and hilarious
ways and from there the amount of

210
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:55,280
interesting things that anyone can do
actually it grows quite exponentially by

211
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,760
the time that you think of how you can
change things through different devices

212
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:01,660
and how as i'll go on to say

213
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:05,230
the modding side of it will allow quite
large expansion of that

214
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,990
and quite frankly the mind-boggling
growth of the ridiculous things in the

215
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:15,460
IOT sex it means that there's quite a
lot of ground for game design by players

216
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,820
and mothers are like and so as I was
saying importantly and probably most

217
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:27,040
importantly the main idea is that we
want players to tell their own stories

218
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,980
through date trails and hidden
information and create new and

219
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:33,760
interesting items and hacks in order to
make discovering these things even

220
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,770
wackier we spent the last several months
funded by the UK games fun to make the

221
00:18:38,770 --> 00:18:44,350
game model so we're using unity which if
any of you know much about game design

222
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,600
or no game designers or fiddle around
yourself till it's become a go-to tool

223
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:50,860
for small teams

224
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:54,070
we're actually kind of on the customer
things because we're using unities

225
00:18:54,070 --> 00:18:59,980
streaming assets to use the unity editor
as a level editor so you can just

226
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:04,540
redistribute asset bundles two players
and they can build their own levels

227
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:07,930
within the full engine tool set and then
send them back to the game and and play

228
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:11,680
them so yeah

229
00:19:12,250 --> 00:19:17,020
more on that in a bit the data points in
the game all carry Lewis scripts and

230
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:22,540
that that affects dates are receiving
devices many objects in the game are

231
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:26,350
essentially basic lure machines that can
respond with different calls from the

232
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:31,389
lower API so the devices are quite
extensible four players or mothers

233
00:19:31,390 --> 00:19:35,200
interested in writing Lewis scripts to
to make interesting things happen as

234
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:41,950
well so that doesn't just mean making
levels and missions that actually means

235
00:19:41,950 --> 00:19:48,820
writing new apps and new data types and
therefore making hacking apps and tools

236
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,320
in the game that can do things that we
as developers never really were able to

237
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,129
think of it wouldn't have been able to
think of in a million years as if any of

238
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:01,000
you are in modern communities usually
modern communities while the developers

239
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,290
week after week so we're hoping to see
player invented devices data types tools

240
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,950
apps and hacks and of course levels of
missions to be filled with all of the

241
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:12,620
above

242
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,989
we've sort of like to be the sort of
south park of data privacy video games

243
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,480
so if if you can think of that as
concept essentially every time something

244
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,930
you're interesting happens in in the
intersect world we would like to see

245
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,970
levels turned around that week

246
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:32,240
so you know when Jake Julie and finally
gets out of the embassy

247
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:35,690
maybe we'll see it in off-grid from from
and ingenuity of mother

248
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,690
so yeah

249
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:45,830
the other thing being have a new design
tool a brief stint on a well known but

250
00:20:45,830 --> 00:20:50,780
slightly rudely name twitter feed can do
wonders for your model ideas and I've

251
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:56,149
come up with a fantastic new technique
and take two IOT products

252
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:59,150
add them together and you have a perfect
trap in off-grid

253
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,470
there's a treasure trove of crazy data
puzzles out there that will hopefully

254
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:06,860
enable the creation of the supply - and
ridiculous

255
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:10,939
I'm looking forward to seeing off grid
players make attempts at possibly some

256
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,460
of these suggestions

257
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,559
so maybe setting polka stops in a local
in a location and overloading the IOT

258
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,220
air fresheners next to it so as the
guard bends over to collect them on

259
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:25,220
he gets gas in the eyes

260
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:30,380
combining bluetooth phone gloves and
vibrating pelvic floor training shorts

261
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:37,190
so that pranking guards phone is
extremely distracting and this one is

262
00:21:37,190 --> 00:21:40,190
already done all of the exercise for me
actually

263
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:45,170
this is a real product hacking the
happiness of a foes health tracking

264
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:49,850
tamagotchi drinks bottle so that they
have to spend the majority of their

265
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:56,209
shift at the water fountain pleasing
their lives as digital friend and but

266
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:03,590
you know this kind of thing I mean I I i
only started really digging into some of

267
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:08,899
the craziest IOT stuff out there
recently and I think we're going to

268
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,080
continue to be flabbergasted by this
kind of thing and

269
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,529
we're already seeing public systems that
take control of the entire rooms for

270
00:22:15,529 --> 00:22:21,620
instance and but you don't necessarily
think about who they're made by so here

271
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:26,479
we have two flavors of the same system
made by rent to kill you probably guess

272
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,740
what they do

273
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:31,789
12 tracks the pest control traps in a
building which you'd expect

274
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:36,710
is there probably their bread and butter
the other is installed in public toilets

275
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:43,039
at the track and alert if people don't
wash their hands which you know as long

276
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:47,539
as they don't get any wires crossed i'm
sure it's fine but I'm surely in a gang

277
00:22:47,539 --> 00:22:50,600
like off-grid crossing those wires to
create quite a lot of fun

278
00:22:51,230 --> 00:22:59,360
okay well I'm actually closing in on the
end of this presentation so thanks for

279
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,928
for coming and listening and and giving
up me a few laughs when I when I

280
00:23:02,929 --> 00:23:09,080
attempted to drop jokes and yeah this is
me I Richardson my purse or rich

281
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:12,080
medicine on twitter you can check us out

282
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:17,870
off grid the game and and please do i if
anyone has any questions I know how much

283
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:26,959
time we've got some great well thank you
very much
