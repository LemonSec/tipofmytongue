1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,820
good morning

2
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,200
you're only just

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,900
arm welcome to stage be the top now is
by David Harvey it's on digital medical

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,709
imaging just a couple of things before
we start firstly if you've got some free

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,070
time today or even tomorrow to help with
her down

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,460
we would really really really appreciate
some volunteers so if you could spare a

7
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,480
couple of hours of your time to
volunteer at something anything on site

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,029
pretty much it would be greatly
appreciated and you might get a free

9
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,020
meal out of it

10
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,969
also we've had a wallet handed in it may
be picked up by now but I'm Robert

11
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,430
durham if you've lost a wallet

12
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,610
it's at the volunteer tense and if you
pick it go - there you should be able to

13
00:00:48,610 --> 00:00:49,390
pick it up

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:54,370
other than that I'll hand you over to
Dave thank you

15
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:57,669
right I can hear me okay

16
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:03,370
this is yeah although i've been granted
the huge honor of a one hour slot

17
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,060
this is still going to be something of a
whistle top store one whistle stop

18
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,189
journey through a really large topic so
I'm going to need to keep going through

19
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:16,720
if it is desperately urgent stick stick
her hand it with a relatively small or

20
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,179
did so i can take odd questions but by
and large if you've got questions call

21
00:01:22,179 --> 00:01:25,210
me afterwards and I'll sort out where
i'm going to be and where we're going to

22
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:25,990
be going

23
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,908
so here's what I'm going to be talking
about I'm talking about the overall

24
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:34,719
pattern of what happens from when one of
you goes along

25
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:41,259
let's say cgp he decides to order a scan
the most horrendously ambiguous term yet

26
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:48,729
used in medicine and he says that off to
the local radiology department is still

27
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:52,090
called despite the fact they do all
sorts of other things other than that

28
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:56,950
people with my energy electromagnetic
radiation and i'm going to use the

29
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:01,539
example here of an MRI you go in line
and not in a noisy tunnel and your

30
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:05,259
television pictures have been generated
week or so later you go back you see a

31
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,030
GP GP he's got a report probably hasn't
got the pictures because the NHS is

32
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:12,849
technology so bad they can't actually
get around the place and that's assuming

33
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:17,319
a GP could make sense of them but
there's lots and lots of things that

34
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:20,769
have gone on in the background
everything from how the images made how

35
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,830
it's stored poets

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,640
indexed retrieved viewed etc

37
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,399
i'm going to try to go through all those
various points along the chain to

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,400
explain what's going on to give people a
bit more insight

39
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,510
so yeah

40
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,760
why am I the person to be doing this
talk well I man or beast

41
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,410
I have a foot in both camps I'm actually
qualified doctor did medicine 82 to 87

42
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,910
so even though I took a year out in the
middle to go away and do a messy medical

43
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,900
computing did relatively normal jobs
then for nine years and everything from

44
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:04,590
being a Houseman working hundred thirty
hours a week with 80 our solid weekends

45
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:09,690
right way through to do my specialist
training as an x-ray specialist they

46
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:15,209
joke by interview that i was asked the
question dr. Harvey you have chosen

47
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:18,930
Radiology's our speciality is that just
because there are more computers the

48
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,400
square foot of the x-ray department than
anywhere else in the hospital my arms it

49
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,420
was only partially but I got the job
because of that all in spite of it I

50
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,589
don't know

51
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:34,860
anyway so including the end of that
after that nine years of training is

52
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,650
still called training even after you've
qualified in medicine

53
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,150
I then had a so-called Korea post for
six years as a consultant radiologist

54
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:45,030
actually specialist in swansea

55
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,840
I'm join which I developed my computer
interests further back

56
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,100
mucking around with the what was there a
relatively new standard for exchanging

57
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,810
digital x-rays will be talking about
more later became a hobby became a part

58
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:59,400
time job

59
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,400
just take a bit more and more of my time
and one day when like little difficult

60
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:09,600
in the department should we put it that
way this is being streamed i decided

61
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,600
that i was going to make a complete
change their last 14 years

62
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:20,100
I a non-practicing dr. running an IT
business we deal with the standards for

63
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,190
exchanging medical images which are we
talking about more later

64
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:28,169
I am officially a sponsor here and most
people we sponsor events come here to

65
00:04:28,169 --> 00:04:29,640
actually try and sell

66
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:34,219
i'm not here to sell if anything I'm
here to buy in terms of buying time

67
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,300
if there are any of you who are hard
core programming geeks who find any of

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,070
this interesting and could possibly put
up with being anywhere near swansea come

69
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:48,500
and talk to me because that is what i'm
actually looking for but I mentioned

70
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:51,590
again at the end but I thought I just
put it in here at the start just to set

71
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,400
the scene

72
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,650
so what is actually happening we're in
and when this examination goes all the

73
00:04:57,650 --> 00:04:58,280
way through

74
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,369
obviously the images have to be made

75
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:05,450
acquired call it what you will and that
i'm gonna be doing a lot of talk about

76
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:09,620
that in the next few minutes about all
the different types of imaging and how

77
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,150
different they are from each other

78
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:16,070
they then getting coded into a
standardized form called dicom digital

79
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,870
imaging and communication in medicine

80
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,140
hands up anybody here who's even heard
of that before today

81
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:24,260
Wow not more than i was expected

82
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:29,719
okay well you might find it but the
introduction to die , bit boring then

83
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,080
sent to the standardized system which is
a which is cross vendor with just about

84
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,950
every way every x-ray department every
hospitals got called picture archiving

85
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:43,340
and communication system where their
index that acts as the repository for

86
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,590
them they may be compressed and well
i'll talk about compression in a moment

87
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,869
which can save you about sixty percent
of storage space then get the tree back

88
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,260
to a viewing station and viewed and
their different ways of viewing them

89
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:01,490
either as they were originally or in
different planes and in different ways

90
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,770
are going to talk about that as well

91
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,549
and then finally of course somebody with
the same sort of letters after name is

92
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,650
may actually sits there and writes a
report saying

93
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:12,710
normal right

94
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,510
there's lots and lots of different
modalities as they're called different

95
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:20,780
types of imaging a in radiology

96
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:26,780
I'm not going to talk about them all but
there's five that i'm using to pick on

97
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,979
to it today because they're sufficiently
different from each other to give a good

98
00:06:30,979 --> 00:06:38,030
cross sectional idea of the sort of
things we do we start off with good

99
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:41,320
old-fashioned plain films x-rays as

100
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,500
most people call and then of course
they're not really x-rays because the

101
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,270
x-ray is actually the beam of
high-energy well photons which actually

102
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,620
passes through the patient

103
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,000
what comes out the other end is
technically called a radiograph yeah

104
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,500
most people call them x rays or or or
plain films and until really 10-15 years

105
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,220
ago

106
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:06,640
most of those were still done with 19th
century technology

107
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,740
most of them were done literally with a
sheet of film of the appropriate size in

108
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:17,530
which the largest sizes 35 by forty
three centimeters with a plate on top of

109
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:18,039
it

110
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,200
you put your part you put your part of
the body by it

111
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:28,299
the x-rays go through they expose a
negative image and then that film

112
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:32,710
literally goes through a processor
exactly the same as you would do with

113
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,880
any with the size of photographic film
everything from a wet lab which they

114
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,469
were still using 25 years ago when i
started radiology through dry processing

115
00:07:41,470 --> 00:07:46,360
to keep help keep health and safety
people happy and then through - of

116
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,750
course some versions where they will
rather more like a photocopier

117
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:54,400
but nowadays more and more of it is
actually done with direct digital

118
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,679
detectors such that they it's like the
same thing as you have a chip in your

119
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,540
camera in your phone or whatever it
actually detect the photons and actually

120
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,080
record them on a great but where is the
one on your camera is that size

121
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,039
these are still that size could it is
not really possible to focus x rays

122
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,630
what is interesting though is just how
similarities to what you have ccd

123
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:20,680
devices for cameras etc because you
don't actually record the x-ray photons

124
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,850
that's very very inefficient to try to
do that because it's not many things

125
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:30,670
which can actually record photons and
have enough heavy nuclei in them to be

126
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:32,110
able to stop them efficiently

127
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:35,409
so what you actually have is one of
which are drawn is this black line on

128
00:08:35,409 --> 00:08:41,049
that on the diagram is a what's called a
phosphorescent plate and as each x ray

129
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:44,800
hits it it produces thousands of light
photons and if you work at the energy

130
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,150
relative energy of x-ray photons light
energy photons that works and it's then

131
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,459
the light which actually gets picked up
by the

132
00:08:52,460 --> 00:08:55,190
detectives it was the same actually with
the later generations of conventional

133
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,120
film as well

134
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,170
the films are responsible to the green
light produced by the phosphorescent

135
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,280
screen rather than to the x-rays
themselves and then of course what you

136
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:09,890
end up with is a good old-fashioned
straightforward x-ray very

137
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:14,960
straightforward still actually one of
the mainstays of a level of a lot of

138
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:18,800
imaging the things that the chest is
brilliant is relatively low dose it's

139
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,219
quick it's easy and you got comparison
records going back for years

140
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:27,410
however taking that one step further

141
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:33,199
same basic method of distinguishing ie
how much x-ray photons get stopped by

142
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,080
the body you can take this one stage
forward further because if you think

143
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:42,800
about that previous image and so that's
a three dimensional structure collapsed

144
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,000
into a two-dimensional image you're
looking through one thing can be behind

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,690
another thing when things can be
difficult to see you don't know what the

146
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,150
depth is so in the late sixties and
early seventies and actually brilliant

147
00:09:56,150 --> 00:10:01,610
guy by the name of God free hands filled
put together was effectively a skunk

148
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,170
works project acts am I

149
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:14,330
yes that is the same am i that produced
the Beatles records and worked out a way

150
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:21,710
of taking hundreds of images from
different directions around the patient

151
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:26,870
recording those digitally feeding them
all into a computer and when he first

152
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:31,460
did it in the late seven in the
mid-seventies you then waited about

153
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,150
three hours from the computer to crunch
the numbers could effectively what you

154
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:39,770
have is a massive set of simultaneous
equations if you've got

155
00:10:39,770 --> 00:10:48,439
let's say in his early images 64 x 64
grid of points in the patient and you've

156
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,250
got

157
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:56,420
let's say 50 tie or 50 readings for each
position the gayatri and you rotated

158
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,550
that round 1 degree intervals

159
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:01,800
you've got a similar number of equations
you actually have to solve them

160
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,839
and these were solved initially
iteratively which is why it took hours

161
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:12,390
and hours on the computers that are
available then subsequently and in the

162
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,290
meantime

163
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,939
most of the work is actually being done
using for your methods which i won't go

164
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,019
into here i got enough

165
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:22,829
there's a there's enough for you to talk
to back you or later and come to the MRI

166
00:11:22,829 --> 00:11:27,839
but interestingly in the last five years
or so people have gone back to doing his

167
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,000
iterative methods now that the computing
power is available to do it at a

168
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,810
reasonable time because they've actually
found you get a better signal to noise

169
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,029
ratio for the same dose or alternatively
and perhaps more appropriately

170
00:11:42,029 --> 00:11:46,439
you can have the same signal to noise
ratio with a lower x-ray dose experts

171
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:49,440
more resistant to to quantum noise

172
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,540
so that's what he does not just to give
you an idea

173
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,569
I spent hours on PowerPoint making this
work so i hope it doesn't go as intended

174
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:01,199
yeah they're up ahead

175
00:12:03,029 --> 00:12:04,649
thank you Michael

176
00:12:04,649 --> 00:12:09,899
and so that's how that CT works and of
course when it's done it all by the way

177
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,350
the green blob in the middle of the
patient education and work out you end

178
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:18,209
up with a picture like that which is
actually picture of my father's brain

179
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:21,660
you and you'll be seeing more of that as
we go through

180
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:25,589
I i do keep this promotion family
related because i know i've got

181
00:12:25,589 --> 00:12:28,290
permission to use those images right

182
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:33,509
ultrasound one of the non-invasive ones
this this one is not going to be

183
00:12:33,509 --> 00:12:38,189
registering on the total population
radiation can't a show not only

184
00:12:38,189 --> 00:12:43,050
dashboard at this event i'm not going to
go into a great deal of detail on

185
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:43,618
ultrasound

186
00:12:43,619 --> 00:12:47,579
other than to say that it's basically
high frequency sonar you're running

187
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,329
signals in the few megahertz range and I
said that deliberately because in fact

188
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:56,729
the modern machines actually use swept
frequency ranges

189
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:59,429
because the higher frequencies give you
a better resolution close but don't go

190
00:12:59,429 --> 00:13:00,269
very deep

191
00:13:00,269 --> 00:13:03,059
the higher free with the the lower
frequencies don't give you is good

192
00:13:03,059 --> 00:13:06,959
resolution but they go deeper so it is
it's quite complex modern ultrasound

193
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,998
machines but basically send out

194
00:13:08,999 --> 00:13:12,990
it's just like sonar you sent out a
pulse you wait and see where it comes

195
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:15,600
back and where it comes back from and
you make a picture

196
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,459
I'm sure you've all seen ultrasound
pictures and antenatal ultrasound scans

197
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:24,959
interestingly from the point of view of
what I'm talking about today which is

198
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,719
how images get passed around the
captures the descrip the pictures you

199
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:35,730
actually take of ultrasound are almost
useless because you don't have a

200
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:40,649
standardized system for where the
probe's and recording it and it and so

201
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:41,129
on

202
00:13:41,129 --> 00:13:46,170
the only person the pictures really make
sense to is the person holding the probe

203
00:13:46,170 --> 00:13:48,748
who knows what they're looking at we
have to record them to keep the lawyers

204
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:49,319
happy

205
00:13:49,319 --> 00:13:53,339
yeah medicolegal wouldn't be allowed to
say oh I've done it is my report and not

206
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:56,249
have something to go with it but
actually the images are very little use

207
00:13:56,249 --> 00:14:00,959
said quite a few people now we're
actually recording video and if you want

208
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,199
to you can actually encoded up in MPEG
and i'll talk more about how that works

209
00:14:04,199 --> 00:14:06,059
with daikon later

210
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:13,170
like almost every part of radiological
imaging the images you get back are

211
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,180
actually single child

212
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,949
there monochrome gray scale but that
doesn't stop people trying to combine

213
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:22,850
different sources of information into
the same picture if they want to

214
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,450
so what you can do with ultrasound
because as well as actually working out

215
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:30,770
what signal comes back from where you
can actually measure its frequency and

216
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:34,939
with a bit of work you can then use that
to actually work at the speed of what

217
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:35,959
you're looking at

218
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,319
apply the Doppler shift and that then
can get overlaid on the image as a color

219
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,890
signal which is incredibly useful when
you're looking at the heart because you

220
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,980
can be very difficult when you're
looking at a foul which they should be

221
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:53,779
that white and has been narrowed by ten
or twenty percent try to actually get

222
00:14:53,779 --> 00:14:57,410
accurate measurements that is almost
impossible but because the flow through

223
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:02,029
it has to be fairly constant the person
wouldn't be alive even if you have

224
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:06,350
dropped the diameter by ten percent you
increase the flow speed through it by

225
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,700
twenty percent because of the square
looks and therefore you can really make

226
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,160
sure that accurately so this is the sort
of ultrasound image you get this is an

227
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,510
antenatal ultrasound

228
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:24,860
this is actually my own twins and if you
look hard at your left you'll see the

229
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:32,870
head of my daughter and on the right you
will see my son who's 18 the week today

230
00:15:32,870 --> 00:15:37,400
and you can tell it's my son because if
you look very very carefully

231
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,550
if you get the bags up there that's one
lake

232
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:43,569
that's the other leg and there's these
balls

233
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:52,420
and he's sitting there looking
embarrassed right

234
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:58,000
yeah

235
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,150
so that shows how well these
technologies and then this was over

236
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:04,510
you know he's 18 next week and this is
over 18 years ago but that's actually

237
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:08,590
funnily enough the capturing these
ultrasounds which is very little use but

238
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,730
was using fast quantities of film which
was not only costing as 40,000 times a

239
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:17,230
year but incredibly eco unfriendly in
terms of all the silver etc was actually

240
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:22,360
the reason why I started playing around
with digital imaging in these days this

241
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,890
wasn't even direct digital this was
literally a video capture off the only

242
00:16:26,890 --> 00:16:30,460
out for the ultrasound machine hat which
was it which was a video I put it into a

243
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:34,630
video card added the demographics and
store that as a magical image it saved

244
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:38,439
the hospital 40,000 pounds a year it
then cause them eventually to lose me

245
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,590
when I decided that was far more fun
than actually taking the pictures from

246
00:16:41,590 --> 00:16:44,260
on the other hand he is this other
source you can get where you've got

247
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,980
ultrasound where we got damn doctor
sorry

248
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:54,010
and again it is only really to channel
information there is the there's the

249
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:57,700
reflectivity information the gray scale
and there is another independent

250
00:16:57,700 --> 00:17:01,660
variable which is which is the flow but
traditionally if you want to show two

251
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:05,319
things you don't just use two colors you
use one is Grace game and the other as a

252
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:07,480
as a false color scale on top

253
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:13,660
so this is a nice picture showing the
heart with with measurable flow right

254
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:17,410
positron emission tomography how many of
you heard of positron emission

255
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:18,130
tomography

256
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:22,839
okay thanks to be sorry good

257
00:17:23,349 --> 00:17:29,020
well it's actually it is a wonderfully
cool met imaging method

258
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,860
it was invented about 20-odd years ago
there's only one slight problem for the

259
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:36,219
first 10 years or so they had it they
knew it was cool

260
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,430
they knew it was wonderful then it was
technologically marvelous

261
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:42,430
nobody could think of a use for it

262
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:49,060
they just hadn't worked act what you
could do in terms of what substances you

263
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,450
could attach the radioactive tracer to
talk about how that's used in a minute

264
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:57,040
how what you could attach it to in a
means that would provide useful

265
00:17:57,040 --> 00:18:01,750
information clinically they have got
there now they got babies markers which

266
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:04,750
they can use which careful going to your

267
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:12,370
radioactive tracer to tissues which are
particularly some cancerous tissues so

268
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:17,350
you've actually got a marvelous way of
localizing where the tumors are because

269
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,810
you've got some material which is guided
there

270
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:23,740
what's brilliant about positron emission
tomography is that where is everything

271
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:29,530
else we're doing here is working on
effectively emergent properties

272
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,149
stochastic effects

273
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:34,600
you're averaging act all these things
that are different happening it

274
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,290
what proportion of your photons get
through finding a quantum noise how many

275
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:40,330
going to get through how many arms and
so on

276
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,600
positron emission tomography you are
actually recording individual

277
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:51,879
radioactive events because what happens
is that if it's a positron emission be 2

278
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:56,170
plus DK what submitted obviously is a
positron and what happens when a

279
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:00,340
positron makes an electron but it
doesn't make morning more electrons they

280
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,370
turn into a pair of photons

281
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:07,270
now admittedly the majority of those
photons are going to be out of the plane

282
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:10,270
of the scammer and you'll never see them
and you'll never become up

283
00:19:10,270 --> 00:19:14,920
but for those that are within the plane
of your scanner as we're showing here if

284
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,910
they both hit the detectors within a
very short time favourite time of each

285
00:19:18,910 --> 00:19:25,000
other you know that the Commission must
be along that line

286
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,280
you also know the relative timing with
which you take those two detectives and

287
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,720
you know the speed of light

288
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:37,630
therefore you can actually place exactly
plus or minus it's a few millimeters or

289
00:19:37,630 --> 00:19:41,350
centimeters is not one of the highest
resolution imaging formats we got

290
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,209
but you actually know from that single
event where in the body

291
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,610
it was obviously then collect a few tens
of thousands of these there are

292
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:57,969
practical challenges with pet largely
due to the fact that the material used a

293
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,390
half-life of only a few hours and you
going to make it in a cyclotron

294
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,520
I'm there for you and by the time you
taken into account all the extra time

295
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:10,600
after injecting in the patient for to
get around the patient etc that the

296
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,779
challenges of actually getting your
isotopes made

297
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:19,539
isolated produced the pharmaceutical
standards shipped around the country

298
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:24,279
injected into a patient and then the
patient imaged when you're half life is

299
00:20:24,279 --> 00:20:28,239
I can't remember the date but no the
half-life of 1500 oxygen

300
00:20:28,239 --> 00:20:32,739
it's a it's a few hours it's it's it's
very short and that does limit the

301
00:20:32,739 --> 00:20:38,889
availability of pet two major centres
and but it's relatively low resolution

302
00:20:38,889 --> 00:20:41,349
so what you actually tend to do it like
i was saying with the ultrasound with

303
00:20:41,349 --> 00:20:45,789
the Doppler is that you actually
overlaid on top of other images and

304
00:20:45,789 --> 00:20:50,529
typically pet and CT I used together so
the CT provides the high resolution

305
00:20:50,529 --> 00:20:55,359
picture to show you exactly which bit of
the body you are and the pets then

306
00:20:55,359 --> 00:21:00,039
provides the functional overlay to show
which bit of the witch bit of that

307
00:21:00,039 --> 00:21:04,658
tissue is taking up the ice atonement
which according to what the isotope is

308
00:21:04,659 --> 00:21:08,589
you can then tell about it now

309
00:21:08,589 --> 00:21:23,918
MRI so sorry where I got a position yes
I should be positron correct thank you

310
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:24,700
very much

311
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,379
absolutely yes I i love nitpicking other
people so i can't complain what people

312
00:21:29,379 --> 00:21:29,978
do to me

313
00:21:29,979 --> 00:21:35,349
right we're now on to MRI which i'm
going to go into in some detail because

314
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:39,939
let's face it it is the only modality
that actually uses a strong

315
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:47,379
electromagnetic field so i have to talk
about that here reading and we are

316
00:21:47,379 --> 00:21:51,399
talking very very strong magnetic fields

317
00:21:51,399 --> 00:21:55,299
I mean and magnetic fields are measured
in Tesla's now I realize most people

318
00:21:55,299 --> 00:21:58,599
when they talk about it if I DMF and the
talk about a Tesla will be thinking

319
00:21:58,599 --> 00:21:59,619
something like this

320
00:21:59,619 --> 00:22:02,678
I'm but no that's not what we're talking
about here

321
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:08,259
the Tesla is that is the unit of
magnetic field strength and to get some

322
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:13,809
ideas there's magnetic field fraction of
a micro tesla fridge magnets a few milli

323
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:17,918
Tesla's high power motors can sometimes
have a few Tesla magnets in them but

324
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,320
they're tightly

325
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:25,560
an MRI machine needs to be big enough to
take a whole patient in it it needs to

326
00:22:25,560 --> 00:22:31,110
have a field that between x 1 and 5
Tesla and they need to be incredibly

327
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:34,110
homogeneous to within a few parts per
million

328
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,139
so that's how they actually built

329
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:40,860
I was going to try to show a real
picture i think the cutaway gives a much

330
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,330
better idea of just the scale of these
things and you realize why they cost you

331
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:46,830
a few million pounds each

332
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:50,820
because not only do you need to build
this have it is accurate

333
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:56,219
you also need to keep the whole thing
for a hold of its life pretty much at a

334
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,300
superconducting temperature so it's full
of liquid helium because you could not

335
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:05,100
make a resistive magnet that was this
that was this strong and this even so

336
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:07,169
they're all super conducting magnets

337
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:15,180
so what is nuclear magnetic resonance
which is what magnetic resonance imaging

338
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:18,240
depends on and i'll talk about the
distinction in a minute

339
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:30,600
whenever you've got a magnetic field any
nuclei with an old spin spin spin around

340
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:33,030
an axis power well to that field

341
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:36,120
now for those of you who have got
degrees in theoretical physics

342
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,860
please accept my apologies i'm doing a
wrote over simplification here

343
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,630
I'm not distinguishing between the spins
of individual nuclei and the overall

344
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,000
route resulting field

345
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,930
this is massively simplified but I hope
it's good enough at third for this talk

346
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,480
if anybody wants to shoot me down on my
physics later

347
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:00,720
please do so but you end up with it with
these nuclei and we're talking hydrogen

348
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:06,180
for imaging there either aligned with
the magnetic field we were imagine the

349
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:12,000
magnetic field going up and down on this
slide or they can be persuaded to flip

350
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:19,530
into the other field by a radio freq by
photon of exactly the right energy which

351
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:22,680
also happens to be by various quirks of
quantum mechanics

352
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:27,740
photon which has the same frequency as
the frequency at which it is processing

353
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,960
because it's like a spinning top

354
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:33,140
it's not it's not it's spinning itself
but then they

355
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,680
but then what we're talking about isn't
it spin speed is procession speed is the

356
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:40,820
speed with which it goes round red and
that speed and this is critical to the

357
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,840
whole of the rest of the imaging is
dependent on the magnetic field strength

358
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,929
it's about 47 maker hurts / Tesla

359
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:53,150
so which actually puts it but the other
two Tesla mad at you know two or three

360
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:56,450
tests the magnet mean you're talking
hundreds 250 acres you actually talking

361
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,880
roughly in the sort of standard radio
bat

362
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,840
I've seen bad and screened MRIs have all
sorts of artifacts which have turned out

363
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:07,669
to be due to local radio sources or the
local taxi company because that is the

364
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:11,690
sort of frequency band were talking
hastened right across non-ionizing there

365
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:14,690
for you yet you're not got the radio

366
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:20,570
you've not got the ionizing radiation
effects

367
00:25:20,570 --> 00:25:26,480
so when the frequent when that energy is
applied it does this it flips

368
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,800
but thats its higher energy State like
most things in the world when they're in

369
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,700
a higher energy state what they like to
do is to flip back

370
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:38,510
so if you put a photon in to make it
flip what happens when it flips back

371
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:45,110
you get a photon back act and varieties
basically nuclear magnetic resonance

372
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,949
chemists do it for years any of you have
done a level chemistry in the last 10

373
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,760
years or so would have come across it
they do it in terms of parts per million

374
00:25:52,760 --> 00:25:53,870
shifts

375
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,989
that's called magnetic resonance
spectroscopy

376
00:25:56,990 --> 00:26:01,250
that is not what we are doing this map
is simple

377
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:06,350
NMR is great for a test tube full of
stuff you put it in there you blast it

378
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,649
you you get the signal out and that's
fine but he's not much use

379
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,680
knowing what the signal from a whole
person

380
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:20,000
please we need to actually know what the
signal is and how much material that is

381
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,870
and it but then again I'm not going to
go into details but whether it's fat or

382
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,129
water or whatever actually has an effect
as well on the different types of signal

383
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,660
so you're not just seeing how much there
is but let's assume for the moment that

384
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,660
we're just seeing how much there is a
particular type

385
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:38,860
we actually need to be able to resolve
it so you're not

386
00:26:38,860 --> 00:26:41,649
that's the difference between my nuclear
magnetic resonance which is the overall

387
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,510
effect a magnetic resonance imaging
which is where you're actually resolving

388
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:52,060
it into a picture and in order to do
that of course you need to have

389
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:57,850
something which is different about the
different directions so as well

390
00:26:57,850 --> 00:27:00,459
I mean it was on the diagram and I
didn't talk about it when you have your

391
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:07,120
MRI scanner as well as the main field
which is this incredibly powerful field

392
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:12,489
there are also three sets of what's
called gradient coils which can change

393
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:14,590
the field by about 1 percentage

394
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:20,620
it's typically a few tens of millions
testers from one end of the patient or

395
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:23,889
one side of the image or front and back
its its tricks that you can resolve into

396
00:27:23,890 --> 00:27:24,910
three dimensions

397
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:30,700
i'm going to call them X Y Zed in fact
you can by using combinations of them

398
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,910
and this is when the great things about
mr i compared to CT

399
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,910
because you can use them in any
combination just with a simple vector

400
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:41,830
multiplication you can actually image in
any plane so as a CT you have to image

401
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:46,000
axiom the other girl named for the cat
scan computerized axial tomography

402
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:50,260
because that's the only way you can
image c NMR I you can image me this way

403
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:56,170
this way this way or obliquely if you
want to and that's very easy for the

404
00:27:56,170 --> 00:27:59,200
time being we're just going to assume
we're talking XYZ is fixed dimensions

405
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:06,310
and of course these field coils producer
the field which is the same direction as

406
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:10,510
the main field but they're changing all
the time but they're producing a field

407
00:28:10,510 --> 00:28:15,640
which is interacting with the big long
strong field can imagine how much force

408
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:20,170
there is on these on these coils you put
one magnet inside another and then

409
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:22,630
change it rapidly backwards and forwards

410
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:26,740
that's going to have some rattling on it
anybody's ever been an MRI scan has

411
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:28,300
probably been given earplugs

412
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:29,970
it's a very good reason

413
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:35,460
the actual vibration on these field
coils is very very strong and very

414
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:43,860
lagged but what when i'm not going to
talk about is how you actually do this

415
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,370
work

416
00:28:44,370 --> 00:28:48,510
I like one of my colleagues down here
looking at the side was very proud to

417
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:52,500
protect me and said I'm am I going to
mention watching him and we have a

418
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:56,730
surprise to feel that I am because this
work was done in the early seventies in

419
00:28:56,730 --> 00:29:01,380
Nottingham and that was actually another
UK Nobel price on top of the one that

420
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:06,270
term coffee ideals got for CT because of
the work i'm going to explain it to have

421
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,360
you actually resolve this signal into
three dimensions

422
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:16,080
lots more animated power points so
resolving in one-dimensional man call an

423
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,510
XY said but it really does matter just
called the 8th dimension another

424
00:29:18,510 --> 00:29:22,410
dimension a dimension but let's stick
with exercise and for that is actually

425
00:29:22,410 --> 00:29:27,990
quite easy because of the resonance
effect if you apply a gradient let them

426
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:34,140
and then you put in a a pulse of radio
frequency energy their natural

427
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:37,620
frequencies it is what I'm showing here
with the blue which is what they would

428
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:38,550
be right

429
00:29:38,550 --> 00:29:42,060
this is what they would be processing at
a different because of the gradient

430
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:46,710
obviously exaggerating for effect on
here so if you have your external radio

431
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:57,810
frequency energy and you put it in there
is only the one slice of patient

432
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,460
where you going to have the residence so
only the only the protons only the

433
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:05,760
hydrogen nuclei in that slice are going
to be excited

434
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,530
the rest are going to be ignoring these
it's like you've got me three nice line

435
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,040
three

436
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:14,040
so they will absorb the energy they will
become excited

437
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,669
so every with me so far we've now got
one slight let's call it a slice around

438
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:27,660
my middle and call that the X so before
i go into the expert i'm afraid i need

439
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:32,790
to do a little bit of a tutorial because
it's important for the rest of it

440
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,500
i'm going to talk about Fourier
transforms anybody here not to know what

441
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,740
for your transform is

442
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:47,740
ok enough for you to make it worthwhile
if you look at your music system and

443
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:50,350
you've got a fancy music system
especially an old one from the seventies

444
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,459
or eighties

445
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:55,960
it may well have a spectrum analyzer
display on it so we actually shows you

446
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,250
all the different frequencies

447
00:30:57,250 --> 00:31:00,880
ok it's actually very crude simple one
mostly they do it by operative you know

448
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,510
what have you got in the super bass down
in the 20 Hertz range

449
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:09,040
what have you got in the middle middle
range around a couple hundred Hertz what

450
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:14,320
if you got up in the high frequency high
hat but the principle of what you do the

451
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,970
Fourier transform is just the same

452
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:21,640
Amy signal can be broken down into a
series of sine ways and any serious and

453
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:27,580
those series of sine waves when put back
together with the correct phase actually

454
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:33,220
then can reconstruct exactly the
original signal something some bandwidth

455
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:37,570
of things but that will be no ever meant
the basic point is you can look at the

456
00:31:37,570 --> 00:31:43,629
frequency way of looking at things all
the time waveform looking at things as

457
00:31:43,630 --> 00:31:49,390
two different ways of looking at the
same data so just like you know if you

458
00:31:49,390 --> 00:31:53,590
were to take a music sound and you can
you could either say here it is with

459
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:59,559
this shape repeating or you could say
our yes that's a signal of 14 Hertz a

460
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:03,910
signal of 32 Hertz the signal 53 hurts
in the following ratios and they're

461
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,890
there are different ways of looking at
the same

462
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:10,809
and what we're going to do with MRI it
depends fundamentally on this idea of

463
00:32:10,809 --> 00:32:11,950
Fourier transform

464
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:20,170
so we're now going to take a read that
we've resolved the the X dimension

465
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:25,120
simply by what we have had excited so in
terms of wet what your screen

466
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:28,780
the X dimension is this way what's
behind the screen here didn't get

467
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,670
excited in the first place doesn't play

468
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:35,350
what's a long one row here doesn't get
inside them like what's in the planets

469
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:39,189
is the one that we've actually excited
by putting the be made have applied the

470
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:42,610
gradient during the time we have been
great we put the energy

471
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:48,910
so we've now got these 16 identical
pixels let's call them

472
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:53,320
ok the findings in the village but let's
that that's assuming things somehow we

473
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:55,178
have to make them more different

474
00:32:55,179 --> 00:32:58,900
such that they're going to be solvable
because it's basically both and

475
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,250
simultaneous equations again

476
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:04,480
so it's actually quite easy to do one
the dimensions which were calling

477
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:11,860
worried because what you do is that you
actually change the Y gradient during

478
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:13,600
the time when you're getting the echo

479
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,750
so you apply one gradient coil you put
the energy in you've spun up just that

480
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:20,620
sequence

481
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:24,610
then why you're getting the echo back
act you apply grade in the other way

482
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:27,039
with changes the speed the spinning

483
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:34,840
so what you get act is a series of
frequencies and each frequency tells you

484
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:38,860
where in this case horizontally but
recording the y direction where the

485
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,178
signals coming from

486
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:44,110
so that's easy and it really didn't take
a great deal of maths and pick their own

487
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:49,000
work for people to work i have had to do
this is the difficult question though

488
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:55,840
you've used one of the gradients during
excitation you've used a second one of

489
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:03,760
your gradients during read out how do
you actually try to get resolution at

490
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,780
third dimension

491
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:09,460
how can you actually get a difference
between the differences along the said

492
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,449
axis and this is what the guys actually
got their Nobel Prize for and I think

493
00:34:13,449 --> 00:34:15,009
they probably deserved it

494
00:34:15,010 --> 00:34:24,520
so now what you use the actual I'm just
thought that you had my talks to use the

495
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:28,719
Exide ex-ranger excitation the white
gradient during retyped how can we use

496
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,069
that great it

497
00:34:30,070 --> 00:34:37,720
the answer is that you use it in that
gap in between but what does that change

498
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,359
how can use that information

499
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:47,409
what changes is the things if you if you
speed something up for a little while if

500
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:50,020
you've got two people walking along the
same speed

501
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:54,879
one of them speeds up a little bit and
then they go back to walking the same

502
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:55,719
state

503
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:59,470
they're not next to each other again
because the one that sped up for a while

504
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:03,160
has moved ahead a bit and then things
that are spinning

505
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:08,830
that's called a phase changes . however
many degrees it it it in advance and

506
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:16,600
that's what you can do with the said and
what you then do our show this moment is

507
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:20,830
you've got more spinning you then

508
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,490
and you have to watch this carefully
because it's subtle you then applied the

509
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:30,279
third grade in change which does this
you will notice what happened

510
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:35,200
they sped up by different amounts just
for a short while such that if you look

511
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,180
at it as a 45 degree phase angle between
each wrote that when the top rows

512
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:45,609
vertical the road beneath it is pointing
at her past 10 beneath it is pointing at

513
00:35:45,609 --> 00:35:49,600
three o'clock and they're open the fact
is pointing at us for so we shifted

514
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:56,170
faced by putting in this intermediate
then of course it redact I you apply

515
00:35:56,170 --> 00:36:02,500
this is about changing speeds and what
we've now got is all 16 are doing

516
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:06,700
something different and that's a
fundamental thing you need in order to

517
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,169
be able to solve the maps

518
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,170
yes this was fun dedicated powerpoint

519
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:15,400
that fast far too long on this talk

520
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:20,440
so what you can't do is you don't have
enough information just from one set of

521
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:24,430
three types because you've only got that
one signal without one set to forward

522
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:26,080
with that one for you

523
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:30,580
so what you actually do is you have this
is why MRIs take a long time

524
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,160
maybe he's had one will know that you
having to sit there for several minutes

525
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:33,850
ago

526
00:36:33,850 --> 00:36:37,868
<operand> twenty </operand> and also the
wonderful noises that they make and I

527
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:42,760
try to make more you do it multiple
times with a different amount of the

528
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:48,850
phase encoding said every time and you
build up a complete and he would see we

529
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,040
have have a series of these lines

530
00:36:51,040 --> 00:37:00,850
oh it's all right i just went backwards
so each one becomes a line you then

531
00:37:00,850 --> 00:37:04,240
for as many rows or columns as you need
for your image you need to do that

532
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:08,319
number of what's called phase encoding
steps and read a pic ended up producing

533
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,410
a picture like this and this is a real
picture and then I'm afraid I have to

534
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:15,759
quit mr. been here

535
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:22,180
you do a two dimensional fourier
transform and as if by magic a picture

536
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:25,810
appears and that is literally what
happens at this stage

537
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:31,029
you've taken the data in a fourier
transforms which would you excuse you

538
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:35,140
from your transform of the image you do
the different phase encoding steps and

539
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:40,210
outcomes that picture and I think the
actual max behind that and the

540
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:45,310
simplicity of it when you actually look
at it in the end compared to what had to

541
00:37:45,310 --> 00:37:46,600
be done with the CT

542
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:53,350
it's bit it has a marvelous symmetry
simplicity and as we pointed apt or

543
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:59,049
unwanted got the Nobel Prize utility as
well so that's how you get an MRI

544
00:37:59,050 --> 00:37:59,980
picture

545
00:37:59,980 --> 00:38:03,609
so where am I yeah for 40 meter

546
00:38:03,609 --> 00:38:09,460
ok so you're made all the different
images you possibly got semen CT scan of

547
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,490
a GE MRI scanner

548
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:17,580
okie son ultrasound machine and a kodak
dr direct digital radiography

549
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,029
how are you going to look at all these
images right time to run around to look

550
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:24,510
at all these machines are going to talk
about for the next part of my talk which

551
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:28,920
is the standard that's used for actually
exchanging these images once you've made

552
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:34,080
them and effectively it's a bit similar
to what you have with JPEG you know

553
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,310
everybody's digital camera

554
00:38:35,310 --> 00:38:39,900
whoever's digital camera tease will make
JPEGs ok there were people who tried to

555
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,540
do other things a few years ago they
pretty much died act so and it's

556
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:49,200
actually JPEGs and daikon was really
more closer to tiff but we know that for

557
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,890
the moment but the point is it's not
just the image is no good just having an

558
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:56,250
image if you don't know which patient is
which part of the body when it was taken

559
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:59,130
which contrast agents have been given
yadda yadda yadda

560
00:38:59,130 --> 00:39:05,160
so basically what you have a dicom you
have the pixel data and you have a whole

561
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,259
load of other stuff that goes with it

562
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:10,740
it's even got its own network protocol
believe it or not because it was

563
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:12,750
invented about the same time

564
00:39:12,750 --> 00:39:17,820
HTTP was being written those variations
HTTP now but at the time at the time

565
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:21,450
nothing else existed they wrote their
own and it isn't it's a very unusual

566
00:39:21,450 --> 00:39:26,460
standard dicom because it encodes
everything from the semantics know in

567
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:30,180
terms of what I'm talking about X Y Zed
it actually defines impatient

568
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:34,830
coordinates which direction they shall
call X which is actually left to right

569
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:39,180
which shall be y which is front to back
in which he said which is head to tail

570
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:42,540
and they even define that for animals as
well which really gets fun

571
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:46,020
now I don't want bloody updates

572
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:52,589
right

573
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,240
I don't have any of you with the
previous talk but they they had the same

574
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,569
thing at the same problem right

575
00:40:00,569 --> 00:40:04,799
so that's what the standard is it's
actually quite fun to be involved in i'm

576
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:09,359
one of the main terms of it and we had a
10 year birthday party for the standard

577
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:10,348
a few years ago

578
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:14,369
she's sad isn't it really I couldn't
find quite find the picture of birthday

579
00:40:14,369 --> 00:40:19,589
cake but I got one somewhere anyway most
imaging standards have got metadata I

580
00:40:19,589 --> 00:40:22,619
mean his I don't expect you to read all
the details but this is a picture taken

581
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,539
by my IT manager of the favor little
character he's got sat on top of his

582
00:40:27,539 --> 00:40:30,569
monitor in our office and it's
interesting to see just how much jpg

583
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:33,930
data where there is you know the tin
foil hat pit brigades might find this

584
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:42,029
really interesting to me to be able to
see the the coordinates at cetera but

585
00:40:42,029 --> 00:40:44,309
anyway that i can take this to a new
level

586
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:48,960
because here we have a CT against it my
father's you'll see in a moment because

587
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,160
the details are in there

588
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,859
his page 1 of the metadata page 2
including his name at the top

589
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,299
page 3 this is where you've actually got
some of the real fun details about the

590
00:41:03,299 --> 00:41:09,180
low about the image itself like the
image matrix 512 by 512 the real image

591
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:15,538
size . for 37 millimeters per pixel 6 16
bits one thing is quite common about

592
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,569
medical imaging is that most of it is
done to more than eight bit

593
00:41:18,569 --> 00:41:23,880
most is 10 12 or 16 bit not sure the
color most of that is still a bit but

594
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:29,700
most the ctsh was actually into a higher
bit depth and then a grayscale

595
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:33,598
transformation called windowing is
applied to the time but three others

596
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:36,269
I've interest I've marked which is
really really important we come to look

597
00:41:36,269 --> 00:41:41,430
at the 3d which is 39 to line them is
we've got the image position which is

598
00:41:41,430 --> 00:41:46,410
relative to an arbitrary coordinate
location but a defined coordinate

599
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:52,230
directions so that tells you where that
particular slice was taken and also its

600
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:57,780
orientation which you'll notice is not
actually one not not not one

601
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,020
which is what you would expect if it was
just along the x and y planes

602
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:04,290
it's actually slightly tipped which
makes it real fun when you come to put

603
00:42:04,290 --> 00:42:08,790
these images together because they're
often taken not like a pack of cards but

604
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:12,810
like a pack of cards that you have
slightly slipped sideways so you don't

605
00:42:12,810 --> 00:42:16,529
actually have a cuboid you've got a a
power level

606
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:21,990
gramma lead which really makes the 3d
reconstruction quite fun and then all

607
00:42:21,990 --> 00:42:24,959
the rest of these attributes including
one interesting one at the bottom of the

608
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,770
pixel data because first icon is
concerned pixel data is just another

609
00:42:28,770 --> 00:42:32,310
attribute has lots of attributes of
these images and one of them happens to

610
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:35,790
be the pixel data you can actually have
objects with a pixel data is getting

611
00:42:35,790 --> 00:42:36,840
rather silly

612
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:43,320
so pretty much for the last 20 years
every manufacturer of digital image of

613
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:46,830
medical imaging equipment in the world
has complied with this DICOM standard

614
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:52,770
and they can all now send their images
into the hospital's picture archiving

615
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:58,530
and communication system which is a huge
great repository and they they they

616
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:04,140
typically you know hundreds of terabytes
some run into Peter bites which use the

617
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:09,060
defined archiving defined indexing
levels of a patient has a number of

618
00:43:09,060 --> 00:43:14,670
studies study has a number of series a
series has a number of images and

619
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,660
they're pretty much modality independent
there are some dependencies in terms of

620
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:23,279
the low level data for instance you know
tube killer voltage which we saw there

621
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:27,420
on the previous at mct would make no
sense for ultrasound and so on but the

622
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:32,340
actual main bulk of it is pretty much
independent so the same packs can handle

623
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:39,090
CT MRI ultrasound and all the others
which is great and then it makes the

624
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:44,760
images back available back to work
stations for people to look at all right

625
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:48,750
I made a joke no talk to John T about
well you know if I'm going to talk about

626
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:49,410
this

627
00:43:49,410 --> 00:43:52,319
I could really try to send people to
sleep with the talk about compression

628
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:54,660
and he said no don't

629
00:43:54,660 --> 00:44:00,240
this is EMF you can't be too techy 3mf
so if you do find this bit too techy and

630
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,370
boring blame John T not me

631
00:44:02,370 --> 00:44:03,529
um

632
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,640
so there are various ways of compressing
images do you all use the fact you're

633
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:12,020
jpegs are far smaller than the more
images medical images are so huge

634
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:16,400
there's a lot to be gained from
compressing them

635
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,700
not least of which of course it's an
emergency situation as i was doing for

636
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:24,049
home review if you want to be able to
get them down limited bandwidth lines

637
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,680
you get there a lot faster if they
compressed i won't go into the details

638
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,529
of lossy vs lossless here

639
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:33,410
there's actually a lot of work so you
can do lossless compression with no loss

640
00:44:33,410 --> 00:44:34,759
of information whatsoever

641
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:38,240
all the techie people agree on that just
can't get the lawyers too

642
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:44,479
but certainly lossless compression the
medical equivalent or imaging equivalent

643
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,290
of zip is well worth while having i'm
just going to talk about that for a

644
00:44:48,290 --> 00:44:50,390
moment because it's quite interesting

645
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:54,920
the fact that you know everybody here
knows if they know how it works i'm sure

646
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:58,070
you all know is looking for repeating
patterns which is why it works

647
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:02,390
marvelously on text and things here
where the letters th e going to keep on

648
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:05,810
appearing in English and keep on getting
replaced by smaller and smaller and

649
00:45:05,810 --> 00:45:08,000
smaller tokens as the system goes
through

650
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,460
you can't really do that with imaging
because you don't have repeated patterns

651
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:17,360
are such the predictability of gotten
imaging is different

652
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:21,800
it's the fact that you most pixels in an
image aren't that different from the

653
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:25,670
pixels rang them so it's the differences
that you're looking at

654
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:30,740
not the absolute values and not the
absolute patterns so that's what's

655
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:34,189
normally use I'll talk about more in a
second so that said for the end for the

656
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:38,630
video and things when you wanting to the
ultrasound box standard mpegs got a lot

657
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,710
to be said for him and that can actually
be encoded within the icon the icon

658
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,860
allows the images to be uncompressed or
losslessly compressed with lossy

659
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:48,650
compressed or even for multi-frame
images it can be

660
00:45:48,650 --> 00:45:52,880
MPEG I'm pretty impressed but still have
all the surrounding metadata to explain

661
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:53,720
what's going on

662
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,930
so here we are he's actually doing some
lossless compression

663
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:02,960
yes I know it's very very techy this but
what you do is you calculate what the

664
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,770
predicted value for a pixel would be
based on the pixels that have been

665
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,230
decoded so far adjacent to it

666
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:12,680
you then calculate the offset which in
most cases

667
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:16,069
is it going to be north of one most
pixels don't differ much from the pixels

668
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:18,589
around you then

669
00:46:18,589 --> 00:46:23,420
Huffman code the number of length the
number of bits that are required to

670
00:46:23,420 --> 00:46:28,460
store that data followed by then
providing the data itself

671
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:32,990
so in this particular case I've used an
example have been coding by the way is

672
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:42,348
arbitrary but it's typical ish so - 07 -
00 - 17 would become code is to needs

673
00:46:42,349 --> 00:46:47,720
comes in the range plus or minus 2 to 3
so it has that is its have been coded

674
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:53,569
value needs followed by two bits which
00 in this case the zeros only need 10

675
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:54,440
bit

676
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:58,400
the minus one comes into the plus or
minus 1 so it has a firm encoding of

677
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:03,740
zero one in which case the value of zero
would mean plus 1 and 1 Willie - one

678
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:08,149
that's the one there and then you've got
the seven which is encourage further on

679
00:47:08,150 --> 00:47:14,420
so you've taken what would have been if
it was 16-bit data 80 bits five values

680
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,869
each time 16 bits and have ended up
encoding the weapon haven't even counted

681
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:18,740
to be honest

682
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:22,459
aight i think I 17 bits

683
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:26,359
so you've got about 3 to 1 compression
there and that's about three or four to

684
00:47:26,359 --> 00:47:28,880
one compression and that's about what
you typically get with this lossless

685
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:32,329
compression because the great thing is
you do actually get back to exactly the

686
00:47:32,329 --> 00:47:36,349
images started with as ever it result
remain it likes it

687
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:41,270
it relies on having predictable these
images apply this to noise and it will

688
00:47:41,270 --> 00:47:44,750
probably expand the image robins and
subtracted but that's you know that's

689
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:45,680
what you get

690
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:51,980
getting images to work stations the
daikon protocol can be used again

691
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,069
this dye column because it does
everything from specify the format of

692
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:59,660
the images through the network protocols
even specifies his own query language

693
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:04,250
it's like a version of SQL almost
because it sort of predates widespread

694
00:48:04,250 --> 00:48:08,150
adoption of SQL this is 25 year old
standard but it doesn't mean you can

695
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,180
find all the images for particular
patients and and call back i'm going to

696
00:48:11,180 --> 00:48:14,868
jump through this bit of it otherwise
we're gonna go on but you don't have to

697
00:48:14,869 --> 00:48:17,450
look how are you going to review such a
large quantity of data

698
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:21,480
well believe it or not when I left
clinical medicine

699
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:26,369
15 years ago we were still taking
digital images and we were printing them

700
00:48:26,369 --> 00:48:31,320
out on two sheets of 17 inch x 14 inch
film

701
00:48:31,859 --> 00:48:36,840
Ellen fixed grayscale mappings and then
reviewing the magnet on the series of

702
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:38,670
monitors like this like this guy here

703
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,359
absolutely crazy but that's what we were
still doing 15 years ago

704
00:48:42,359 --> 00:48:47,400
digital to analog to look at which they
lose all the flexibility you could have

705
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:52,830
then the next step was to go digital but
to try to replicate whatever you've been

706
00:48:52,830 --> 00:48:54,390
doing any analog world

707
00:48:54,390 --> 00:49:01,350
so is the stage where people had banks
of 21 inch CRT monitors which was not

708
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:04,529
much fun when combined with the NHS rule
they are not allowed to have air

709
00:49:04,530 --> 00:49:07,590
conditioning in offices it

710
00:49:07,590 --> 00:49:13,410
imagine these in a going back 15 years
in in a small office and it gets very

711
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,899
warm

712
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:20,940
yes yeah we could do is in here as well
because may then people move forward to

713
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:25,290
looking at them are in in real time for
smaller numbers of monitors

714
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,369
then they realize that in fact with a
modern computing power you could

715
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:32,070
actually look at these images in
different directions and I'll go show is

716
00:49:32,070 --> 00:49:36,150
live in a moment but these these images
were obtained by taking slices this way

717
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,480
and then been reformatted into slices
other ways

718
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:47,010
uh and you can look through mathematical
maximum intensity projection and then

719
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,510
you can actually do

720
00:49:48,510 --> 00:49:51,900
volume rendering if you really want to
produce fun fancy and fun looking images

721
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:56,730
have I say that carefully because they
are great fun to producing i'll show you

722
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:57,900
some now in a moment

723
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:02,580
the medical usefulness volume rendering
is great for showing patience is great

724
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:07,319
for impressing at sales conferences in
practice not many people actually do it

725
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:10,530
but the big thing nowadays it is you
want to go to talk about next in the

726
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:14,520
remaining 5 10 minutes and i got is that
of course you don't need the

727
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,520
supercomputers you used to have need to
be doing this

728
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:22,410
your average GPU like what I've got here
and I integrated graphics on my laptop

729
00:50:22,410 --> 00:50:27,000
is actually good enough to be able to be
doing this live in real time with really

730
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:30,119
quite simplistic programming so if I
just quit out of this for the moment

731
00:50:31,410 --> 00:50:34,920
well have had this is working when it
moves over

732
00:50:39,059 --> 00:50:43,140
I see - oh yeah right

733
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:46,859
so there we are this is the sick this is
even just like it doesn't just know this

734
00:50:46,859 --> 00:50:48,598
is actually my father's brain again

735
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,200
- images the green and red lines anybody
work out what they are

736
00:50:52,770 --> 00:50:58,890
so no they're actually where each image
is on the other image

737
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:02,700
so if i move where that if i scroll that
one backwards and forwards you see you

738
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:06,538
see you see the line on the other if I
move this one which is moving side to

739
00:51:06,539 --> 00:51:09,839
side it moves that one and you can do
all sorts of wonderful things that would

740
00:51:09,839 --> 00:51:18,450
make you sick if you did this with your
real head you just spin them around and

741
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:19,200
so on

742
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:25,618
I get all of this this is actually a
single 3d texture held in the GPU which

743
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:32,160
I'm just not just re rendering that that
same texture again and again with with a

744
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:39,180
different matrix to say how to say how
to be applying it and that's yeah it's

745
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,700
relatively simple this is simple cut
plane so you only need to do one

746
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,700
operation for pixel is really quite
trivial

747
00:51:45,329 --> 00:51:48,329
maybe this is a bit more fun maximum
intensity projection

748
00:51:48,990 --> 00:51:54,029
this is fine see mr I didn't talk about
it earlier but things you can do with

749
00:51:54,029 --> 00:51:57,630
MRI is you can actually do more fancy
things like you look where things are

750
00:51:57,630 --> 00:51:58,200
moving

751
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:01,799
you can look whether whether they're
flowing and this is an angiogram this is

752
00:52:01,799 --> 00:52:05,849
looking at the blood vessels in the neck
done with MRI without having to inject

753
00:52:05,849 --> 00:52:08,940
contrast medium without having to go
putting a needle in somebody's growing

754
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,150
and inject all the stuff in the used to
have to do but the thing about this is

755
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,829
you can you can just do this

756
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:19,859
you can look around one little nice
oddity in view of what i was saying

757
00:52:19,859 --> 00:52:21,900
about phasing coding earlier

758
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:27,569
can anybody work out what this bit here
is gone

759
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:34,150
No so now what

760
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:39,340
it is chin you have encoded in that
direction using faiths if you go too far

761
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:42,340
phase can only go from naught to 360
degrees

762
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:46,750
if you go too far in traps and what
we've actually ended up with because

763
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:48,790
they didn't quite get the positioning
right

764
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:52,930
is this his chin which should be here
has actually wrapped around the back of

765
00:52:52,930 --> 00:52:58,390
his neck here and therefore I know
looking straight at the radio just

766
00:52:58,390 --> 00:52:59,500
looking at this picture

767
00:52:59,500 --> 00:53:02,650
I know which was in terms of what i was
talking about earlier which is the Y

768
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,810
direction which is the third direction

769
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:08,259
Zed direction phase encoding direction
is the front to back because that's the

770
00:53:08,260 --> 00:53:09,700
only one that can wrap

771
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:12,759
so we've got the wrap on there but one
nice thing you can do with a special

772
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:17,500
want to look at things in detail again
if i go into a straightforward axial

773
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:18,640
view looking down

774
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:22,270
I've got the ability again because it's
all just in the GPU reasons - I can do a

775
00:53:22,270 --> 00:53:28,090
cut and spin it round from there so you
can move stuff out the way that's

776
00:53:28,090 --> 00:53:30,100
fucking then again

777
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,790
yeah this isn't this isn't a
supercomputer this is a bulk standard

778
00:53:33,790 --> 00:53:39,040
business laptop with integrated graphics
going back to my father's head again

779
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,080
because it's been more fun this one

780
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,380
there's a prize for anybody who can work
out what was actually wrong with my

781
00:53:44,380 --> 00:53:48,880
father and why it had to have this done
because this feels like clothes and the

782
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:50,080
top of the head

783
00:53:50,080 --> 00:54:00,160
no no now though there were times I feel
like would actually be like to do that

784
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:06,850
myself but don't know bag art I have to
work out the prices

785
00:54:06,850 --> 00:54:10,960
you're welcome to my company bucks
that's the prize i didn't i didn't

786
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:14,620
morning what the fuck was that you had
the cutting for here is really great fun

787
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:18,460
if you look at the base of the brain
which is great which is really young and

788
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,810
lovely fun structure

789
00:54:19,810 --> 00:54:26,560
I can do that now if I spin you're
looking down inside inside the brain and

790
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:31,960
again just pointing out this is all on
that this is just using AG GPU is

791
00:54:31,960 --> 00:54:33,130
technology which was

792
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:37,060
it's been invented an optimized for
games boys it wonderful for radiology

793
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:40,660
and I've got another image here

794
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:44,560
this is from the jaw it's a bit slower
because this is a higher

795
00:54:44,560 --> 00:54:48,279
I think it is a faggot by a thousand by
500 or something says you know there's

796
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,060
basically a gigabyte of data here but we
will have attracted 64

797
00:54:52,060 --> 00:54:56,259
it's a 16-bit data and again you see if
you want to look from behind

798
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:02,620
oh dear I got stuff in the way so if we
go back to say the axial view

799
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:06,370
I put a cut line all cut rectangle cut
around here

800
00:55:09,250 --> 00:55:13,390
go back to rotate it's going to do it
this way so I can see where I'm going

801
00:55:13,390 --> 00:55:17,109
around and now you can see the back of
the teeth

802
00:55:17,110 --> 00:55:22,000
nice and clearly i don't know

803
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:26,410
none at none of this is rocket science
but it does give me an excuse to go back

804
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,828
into my last

805
00:55:28,829 --> 00:55:32,069
slide which is just about right i got a
couple minutes left

806
00:55:33,239 --> 00:55:36,299
which is to say that I actually know
what I should do is my business I'm

807
00:55:36,299 --> 00:55:39,509
responses don't believe I'm like to talk
about my business for a few minutes but

808
00:55:39,509 --> 00:55:41,609
unlike most sponsors I'm not actually
here to sell

809
00:55:41,609 --> 00:55:44,910
I very much doubt with any of you guys
here who actually want to buy a dicom

810
00:55:44,910 --> 00:55:46,379
toolkit

811
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:52,380
if you want to yes please come talk to
me but what we do is we don't do the

812
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:56,339
primary imaging we do all these sections
are labeled up here we we provide a

813
00:55:56,339 --> 00:56:00,209
software tool kit which enables people
to convert raw data into die come to

814
00:56:00,209 --> 00:56:03,868
handle it to do the network protocols
the query in the accessing and all that

815
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:08,009
3d rendering is actually our own
software as well so what I would like to

816
00:56:08,009 --> 00:56:13,200
say obviously that's what we do we do .
com tool kits with hundreds of customers

817
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,489
throughout the world

818
00:56:14,489 --> 00:56:18,779
we're supporting other developers we
don't have to deal with blips we don't

819
00:56:18,779 --> 00:56:20,369
have to deal with the end users

820
00:56:20,369 --> 00:56:23,670
we know we only deal with the developers
so it's a great fun job

821
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:29,069
and guess what we could do with an extra
person or two

822
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:32,099
so if any of you find this particularly
exciting

823
00:56:32,099 --> 00:56:36,749
if you're hardcore programmer you love
the challenge of working in a totally in

824
00:56:36,749 --> 00:56:39,509
structured environment with multiple
different languages

825
00:56:39,509 --> 00:56:45,569
come talk to me for five min to be a
tent afterwards and I might have a job

826
00:56:45,569 --> 00:56:48,569
for you . and finishing

827
00:56:52,049 --> 00:56:55,049
yeah

828
00:57:00,210 --> 00:57:04,500
thank you very much you've got about
three minutes left so if you like to

829
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:08,190
take like two more questions or so I'm
I'll take the two closest which of these

830
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:11,190
two here

831
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:16,859
thanks very much I just a quick question
about the MRI scanning that I might have

832
00:57:16,859 --> 00:57:17,759
missed

833
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,990
and you get frequency domain back from
the receiver do you

834
00:57:21,990 --> 00:57:26,310
and is it just a single frequency pulse
or do you actually vary the frequency of

835
00:57:26,310 --> 00:57:27,750
the transmitter as well

836
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:33,119
you right you jet I was talking to terms
of putting a single frequency pulse in

837
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:38,609
what you actually do is you put multiple
frequency policies in and you actually

838
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:43,680
image several different slices at the
same time the ways of doing it with

839
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:47,640
minimal interference because when their
echoes are timed so the certainly the

840
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:52,020
generator can produce multiple different
frequencies and there are uses for doing

841
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:56,339
so but the simplistic version i was
giving here won't be the one slice would

842
00:57:56,339 --> 00:57:59,009
be a single frequency in and then other

843
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:02,550
I a multiple frequency bandwidth limited
signal act

844
00:58:04,109 --> 00:58:07,500
ok - small questions

845
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:10,500
first of all I recall that and radiology

846
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:15,000
usually you use black and white gray
scale monitors with a higher resolution

847
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,380
like 10 bit

848
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:21,900
is this still a thing or for current
this place catched up and I like you

849
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:27,720
also to say something about the amount
of gain you can get from jpg lossless

850
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:31,319
compression which I just found out today
that it exists

851
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,119
never heard of it how much data can
actually save using that right okay

852
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:41,550
first question second question first is
the easy one because it's updated

853
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,930
dependent lossless you the degree of
compression you get depends on the data

854
00:58:45,930 --> 00:58:50,190
you put in and the at the engine bit
more precise the entropy content you

855
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:56,339
typically get about two-and-a-half to
three-and-a-half to 1 compression so

856
00:58:56,339 --> 00:59:01,380
you're typically saving about sort of
sixty to seventy percent but it does

857
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:04,440
vary according to the noise level the
noise of the data the less compression

858
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:04,980
you get

859
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:09,390
it and it was actually defined in the
same standards define the original jpg

860
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:12,629
believe it or not that's a mighty
specification to find the one to find

861
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,619
the lost this is justice

862
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:18,810
it's rarely used as I dicom the monitors
there's a lot I Liberty stayed out of it

863
00:59:18,810 --> 00:59:22,859
i mean you know I had a job to squeeze
everything into our so there are all

864
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:27,450
sorts of standards about how many bits
output you need to be displaying and

865
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:32,790
there's a consistency standard what more
the work is showing in fact is it

866
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:39,600
actually properly calibrated eight bits
will actually do you fine but what many

867
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:44,160
so what many people are now doing is
taking a bit with calibration in the

868
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:47,100
video card to produce the right

869
00:59:47,100 --> 00:59:52,980
look up table in the card rather than
the previous approach which is

870
00:59:52,980 --> 00:59:57,480
calibration software which then required
2-10 bit output card but what most

871
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:00,630
people completely forget if they do all
they're careful calibration to get it

872
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:04,619
absolutely right in a darkened room and
then they sit there actually trying to

873
01:00:04,619 --> 01:00:08,670
use their carefully calibrated monitor
in a in a room with the windows open in

874
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:11,369
which case your calibration goes
completely to pot anyway you might as

875
01:00:11,369 --> 01:00:14,430
well not have bothered and there's
actually more people actually getting

876
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:22,080
fda approval for viewing on ipads bit
dodgy to me but no imagine to get it

877
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:25,080
through the regulatory side

878
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:29,570
I'm afraid that's all we have time for
but thank you very much Dave
