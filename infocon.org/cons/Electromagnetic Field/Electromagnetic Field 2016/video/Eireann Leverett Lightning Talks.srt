1
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,290
yeah

2
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,128
the music you

3
00:00:16,129 --> 00:00:20,480
earlier was there you go

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,009
that was Kimiko and kimiko basically out

5
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:30,470
well made bach public domain because
Marcus dead for quite some time so the

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,930
rock music is public domain but any
recording is it isn't gospel there's

7
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:37,970
people who actually done that

8
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:43,550
I'm she didn't like that so she
basically open source back and we like

9
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:46,070
that lots and we are home

10
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:50,030
their will and we liked her for a we
like we like her we lie

11
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:54,470
so we asked her to give a presentation
on a conference and she jets well Cheryl

12
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:58,009
do that but once I'm there I might as
well play a bit

13
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,309
that's a well that could be a problem
because she's a classic be honest

14
00:01:04,309 --> 00:01:09,259
so she needs an actual piano you can't
really give her a keyboard canyon so we

15
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:14,840
need him a burden door which is
expensive is also expensive to insure we

16
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,100
wanted in the middle of a field in a hot
tent and so it has to be tuned over and

17
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:26,089
over and over again and we have to find
and actually supplier who is willing to

18
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:31,579
lend us some do something like that so
it's a lot of problems with a potential

19
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:34,880
awesome and as hackers

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,170
of course we did it because and in the
end it was awesome

21
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:46,609
so as hackers tend to not steer away
from big problems or for bigger problems

22
00:01:46,609 --> 00:01:52,429
stand absolutely necessarily because
potential awesome arm becomes like this

23
00:01:52,429 --> 00:01:59,389
and others arm spawns quite a lot of
very good initiatives that were better

24
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:02,689
dad that better the world i mean i'm
talking about open source is piece

25
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,850
episodes initiative at all

26
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,810
I crypt the phones also stuff well you
guys know

27
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:13,010
so if you look at at at all these well
it could be

28
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:19,399
federal agents written so after that
jumbo but at the sports i think these

29
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,500
are the these these venues are important

30
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,720
and not just a digital world but the
world at large but if you look at all

31
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:33,290
these I mean yes there's lots of some of
us every four years somebody two years

32
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:40,489
for every years but it all boils down to
about one week a year and that's less

33
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,860
than two percent efficiency

34
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:48,200
that's not really what we're aiming for
I think you might think well you can do

35
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:48,739
that

36
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:56,330
more like an echo space but then again x
pace most active spaces don't really

37
00:02:56,330 --> 00:03:01,760
like sleepovers elite you at least not a
mass so it's not really a 24-7 thing

38
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,170
it's not even a seven thing let alone a
24-17 ok

39
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:10,458
Who am I your wires i'm a member of tool
in the matter of had member of had 40 to

40
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:19,610
get stuff for ohm and during day time I
do the cybers arm and i have a dream the

41
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:24,080
dream starts off with the most awesome
hackerspace in existence

42
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:28,250
those are not my words might you are
those are the words of Haqq a day who

43
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:32,780
visit quite a lot of hacker spaces and
well I came up with that

44
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:39,680
listen awfully nice building and at this
and there's even a church that we can

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,260
use and we even did a hacker wedding
there so it's full operational

46
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:52,399
so this I think is an awesome actor
space that we maybe need to supersize

47
00:03:52,400 --> 00:04:01,700
make it bigger have more rooms to enable
it to have sleepovers and maybe we need

48
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,040
a nice entrance

49
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:12,709
just because can are a couple of weeks
ago this plot came on the market

50
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:17,560
and I wanted

51
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:22,930
it's at the moment is housing refugees
but that's that's supposed to be a

52
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:29,080
temporary situation and it actually is
krista because this is an old jail and

53
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:34,510
the the DPR thing of housing refugees in
jails is apparently frowned upon

54
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:40,270
so but i don't mind i want so a couple
of weeks ago this disc came to market

55
00:04:40,270 --> 00:04:45,820
and i had a dream for way longer than
that but because it came to market and

56
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:51,130
we kind of got a cake in about to
actually place a bit on there on the

57
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,290
thing and are actually at the moment
it's not but that means we just have

58
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:59,710
more time and the spots

59
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:05,289
how big it is well this is our main
building at the hackerspace this whole

60
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,430
building

61
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:10,810
Fitz of course it doesn't work if it
does you see this

62
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:17,740
ok fits in this one so yes it's super
sized the tiny little round thing here

63
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:25,630
is a open space and because you guys do
feed in inches and shillings and God

64
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,800
knows what the we do meters i have no
idea how to wear how to compare to that

65
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,800
so we'll put some stuff in it in this
open space

66
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,340
this building fits and yes that's the
White House

67
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:43,539
so much for world domination you can
actually and you can still walk around

68
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:46,060
it so it's pretty big

69
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,370
and if you're not into architecture this
also fits to follow of fully adult

70
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:54,070
ground blue whales back to back

71
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,250
yes you still walk around it height

72
00:05:57,250 --> 00:06:05,110
if you put the at this miracle thing
straight up and it just does not fit

73
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,680
but just if you leave no stone you're
done

74
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,389
so if you Prince a one-to-one mock-up of
a special to have to spot to do that

75
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,600
cool ok

76
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:28,040
is the plot is has lots of it and it's
billion and what we're gonna do is we're

77
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:36,350
going to start a foundation and that's
gonna procured funds and with those were

78
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:40,880
going to buy the stuff and this
foundation were the wood the first

79
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,760
tenant will be actually -

80
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:50,630
and yet that will have Brooks what I
want in this course the the facility has

81
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,889
just a dome alone has 200 rooms

82
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:05,239
that's just a dome rooms are rooms are
us if you look at this

83
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:12,020
let's do it to her so 200 still visible

84
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:19,880
okay so that's two hundred tiny hotel
room like like dormitory kind of hostile

85
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:23,330
that that kind of level because my puter
are tiny

86
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,729
so those were going to give out and hire
out a readout it depends on who's coming

87
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:35,419
and so that gives you your
twenty-four-seven presence and this will

88
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:36,830
be where are we

89
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:43,639
this will be office space for startups
tech companies and mind you tech

90
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,470
companies we like and it's going to be
really I'm gonna be different

91
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:55,400
uh that's a sports arena so we just
print a big white h on it and be

92
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,210
dominated

93
00:07:56,210 --> 00:08:04,909
and again we will have a church goes
well come down great can you arm so it

94
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:11,969
will be a hackerspace but stupidly
super-sized

95
00:08:11,969 --> 00:08:17,939
my idea is it becoming a a European
hacker help like the European hacker up

96
00:08:17,939 --> 00:08:21,869
so if you come to Europe of course you
go there and there will be more

97
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:28,319
luxurious accommodations than just the
hostel and those will be primarily for

98
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,419
paying customers arm

99
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,879
we're looking at ways to get electricity
virtually for free and that will get us

100
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:43,169
as one of the first Lions will be a is B
or a Colo location cause well that the

101
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,639
domain and the main causes electricity
and ours isn't armed but we're also

102
00:08:50,639 --> 00:08:54,750
having a having contact with
universities you can house PhD students

103
00:08:54,750 --> 00:09:00,389
here for God's love God's along and of
course as a hackerspace now you can have

104
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:04,800
hackers in resident so if you have a
hacker coming from abroad

105
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,639
just look you can have him there will be
eating facilities at this is around here

106
00:09:11,639 --> 00:09:16,709
that this is a disability entrance you
you saw the picture of and there will be

107
00:09:16,709 --> 00:09:22,050
a coffee place with all the all the
things that should be and there will be

108
00:09:22,050 --> 00:09:28,709
a canteen also which will be serving
food at almost cost so not leaving their

109
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,779
hacker compound will not kill you

110
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,170
that's the idea of how my own time

111
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:38,128
ok cool

112
00:09:38,129 --> 00:09:45,870
ok that's the around so that that's the
initiative and well you saw me pointing

113
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:49,949
it at buildings and every now and then
telling what we're going to do with it

114
00:09:49,949 --> 00:09:53,219
and I didn't point at the mall for a
reason

115
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,129
I have no idea because it's so stupid
big that there are still a ton of

116
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,000
options

117
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,500
actually our old beggar space which was
bigger than a new one

118
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,769
also had that we had rooms to spare

119
00:10:07,769 --> 00:10:12,029
which gives you options and flexibility
so if you come if somebody comes along

120
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:14,069
and says I have the school project

121
00:10:14,069 --> 00:10:18,628
I need that room for about three months
and then it's a tiny tiny vote in a

122
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:20,010
fucking delivered

123
00:10:20,010 --> 00:10:26,160
so that's that debt kind of flexibility
works because just looking at that human

124
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,020
space in the middle

125
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:31,500
what the hell do you want to do it I
don't know

126
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,510
I have some options but I mean what one
of them was because it's an old building

127
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:44,490
and we thought a message system and
being not IP so tiny quadcopters moves

128
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,630
around from between all those two
hundred rooms that will be awesome

129
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,930
it's a bit of harry potter ask but then
techie so it's really so the idea is to

130
00:10:54,930 --> 00:10:59,310
actually get there because it's an arm
which is quite central in Europe if you

131
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:06,390
look at it in a way which is what we do
and then it will be quite central and it

132
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:08,040
will be really you can get there

133
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,670
it's it be in a prison of call of course
it's world

134
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:15,180
it's in the middle of the city but
because its wall then the walls are

135
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:19,800
quite thinking quite high and you can
get away with quite a lot without

136
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,050
disturbing the neighbors which is

137
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:25,290
yeah kind of what we want to do so

138
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:30,689
the church will be used for well of
course all or weddings and at least once

139
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:33,769
a week there will be given a lecture and

140
00:11:33,769 --> 00:11:38,600
and that will be open for the public of
course and yeah basically that's it

141
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:41,629
I mean so you have tech companies who

142
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:47,209
oh yeah and one thing we do we try to
have to make the canteen and the coffee

143
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:52,248
place that interested in that cheap that
no one will even think of putting the

144
00:11:52,249 --> 00:11:58,759
coffee machine is in his own room so the
canteen will be the living the domingo

145
00:11:58,759 --> 00:11:59,989
place of all the people

146
00:11:59,989 --> 00:12:04,519
so if you just come in now that's that's
that's cheap office space or read it and

147
00:12:04,519 --> 00:12:08,600
I won't bother with the rest of us then
you'll have a very short leash

148
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:13,339
basically the same goes for their for
the housing costs for therefore for the

149
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:14,779
building itself

150
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:20,749
that's basically it so we're looking for
a couple million now and actually what

151
00:12:20,749 --> 00:12:24,259
we're looking for is not so much well of
course we're looking for money

152
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:29,059
everybody use but we actually have that
you were actually looking mostly for I

153
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:30,319
ideas

154
00:12:30,319 --> 00:12:37,009
so if you have a bald idea that needs
room that we will have time wise this is

155
00:12:37,009 --> 00:12:37,910
about

156
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,179
hopefully will be here in about three
years so it's a process

157
00:12:41,689 --> 00:12:45,110
so if you're interested

158
00:12:45,949 --> 00:12:51,258
drop me a line at this address there's a
little tiny quiz asking a couple of

159
00:12:51,259 --> 00:12:56,329
questions and then you have to answer
but please do and well looking forward

160
00:12:56,329 --> 00:12:59,479
to your great ideas and hopefully i can
join you

161
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,920
you will join us at the opening party in
about three years in this or some space

162
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,920
and number

163
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:23,969
so I'm BSB and i'm here to try and keep
things moving as they all fall apart

164
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:27,120
this is affectionately known as The
Muppet Show because the lightning talks

165
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,010
and there's always some technical
difficulties

166
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:32,640
I have to say thanks again to you ask
for opening things up for us I really

167
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:36,990
enjoy this guy's company because he
rocks a suit and steel toed boots at the

168
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:41,160
same time and as an industrial systems
hacker I really appreciate this right

169
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:44,399
a lot of times i got an engagement and I
have to find dress shoes that are also

170
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:48,600
steel cap so i can go out to the to the
you know electrical plants and do some

171
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:53,279
work but also go back and present the
findings to to the to the exact

172
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,820
so I'm we have a couple basic
announcements one is they need lots more

173
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:00,480
volunteers today so if you're willing to
work in the kitchen will feed you and if

174
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,899
you're willing to work audio video stuff
tonight

175
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:07,620
they really need people on the AV teams
and speaker Ops teams for this evening

176
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:11,610
so please volunteer we really appreciate
it and secondly if there's anyone else

177
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:14,940
doing a lightning talk in the room that
sign up in advance I'd like you to

178
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:18,480
please come to the front so i can
identify you and no no who's here

179
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,900
we had lightning talk difficulties this
year because we're trying to schedule

180
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,520
some of them and leave the friday night
was open and flexible and that wasn't

181
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,130
made sufficiently clear to everyone else

182
00:14:29,130 --> 00:14:32,130
so we good we good for the next one

183
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:43,500
alright so i really enjoy standing up
here in these bright lights because then

184
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,500
you know I'm blind and I can't see
anything and I don't know what any of

185
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,889
you are doing and so I appreciate it
when you make noise for the speakers

186
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:54,029
I'm and in particular this speaker got
cut off last night which is really quite

187
00:14:54,029 --> 00:14:58,889
a tragedy because he wanted to show you
his API he was hoping that you would

188
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:02,970
have some things here at the camp and
they have a really exciting project so i

189
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,120
won't say any more about it i'll let him
let him say what he likes about his own

190
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,110
project but please give a warm round of
applause to to Charles yarnold for

191
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:13,110
waiting until today to give his talk

192
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,220
what's going on with the 10 is right

193
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:40,759
good and i'm also giving out badges
while things continue to not stream

194
00:15:40,759 --> 00:15:45,259
properly so I've been to a lot of
conferences and I've enjoyed myself and

195
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:47,420
we might play a game with these badges
later

196
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:50,899
I'm just talking until you let me know
that that presentation is sorted out

197
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,220
so anybody want a badge are you awake

198
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,910
is anyone awake if you had coffee you
want a badge alright so the right side

199
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:01,219
is louder than the left side where you
guys going to do about that you can

200
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:02,329
imagine

201
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:06,680
there you go I'm sort of the redneck mr.
t in this sort of scenario

202
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:11,389
partly because the Hat partly because I
grew up in the States so left side not

203
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:12,860
awake hasn't had any coffee

204
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:19,790
all right right side yeah you're not
doing very well and so what is the left

205
00:16:19,790 --> 00:16:20,360
side done

206
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:24,319
anybody giving talks yes no

207
00:16:24,829 --> 00:16:27,769
are you awake this talks over there are
your lightning talk speakers as well

208
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,750
right okay cool come on up to the front

209
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:32,839
you can have badges just take a batch

210
00:16:32,839 --> 00:16:37,670
yeah just take them in a little while we
we will use these for some sort of silly

211
00:16:37,670 --> 00:16:46,969
game and you can see how you enjoy that
cool one for each of you and we still

212
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,069
having trouble with the streaming

213
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:52,639
yeah this is why this is the muppet show
so usually we play The Muppet Show theme

214
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,779
- because you know where Muppet
shuffling right we move around we do our

215
00:16:56,779 --> 00:17:00,230
lighting talk and like I said I really
appreciate the lightning talks I don't

216
00:17:00,230 --> 00:17:03,079
know about the rest of you but I'm it's
difficult to get up and speak for the

217
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:06,198
first time and even if you've spoken
before you have a strange idea

218
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,640
yesterday I told a joke about lambda
calculus and the audience actually

219
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,449
laughed

220
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:14,959
I i found it amazing i'm not used to
audience laughing at jokes particularly

221
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,770
lambda calculus jokes but that's a MF
camp for you right

222
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:23,480
I've had a really good time I hope you
guys have a have you said thank you to

223
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:29,690
the organizers now on twitter at least
or like in a text message though they do

224
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:30,740
appreciate that

225
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:33,950
how's it going Charles all right good

226
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:37,550
well I'm how about a warm round of
applause for the MF camp organizers

227
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,820
thank you very nice it feels good

228
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:52,340
almost there I'm moving slides around
all right cool j doc presentation i'm a

229
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,689
big fan of Jay duck

230
00:17:53,690 --> 00:17:59,030
in fact that's worth an actor i went to
44 con two years ago or something and

231
00:17:59,030 --> 00:18:02,210
there were a bunch of people playing the
capture the flag competition and there

232
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:07,340
was one team there was beating all of
the other teams severely had something

233
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:12,620
like 40 challenges out of 50 and the
others were still solving a 10 or so and

234
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,439
I was standing outside and I said you
know who is this person

235
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,740
this team and Jack walked up and I was
like oh that's me

236
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,429
I just thought i'd do the whole CTF on
my own i didn't i didn't to teammate I

237
00:18:22,429 --> 00:18:22,910
just

238
00:18:22,910 --> 00:18:28,610
rock on and he is a very talented guy so
he did win that competition and then let

239
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,580
the second place people have the prize
because it was sort of unfair to be

240
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,230
competing against jadek right

241
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:36,470
noj dog right stuff

242
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,770
no still not set

243
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,889
it's really difficult up there honestly
those lights really bright that's why

244
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,450
I'm hang out down here with you

245
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:49,250
I'm not used to sunlight as you can
imagine they don't let industrial

246
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:53,870
systems hackers out into the sun all
right we're all set

247
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:58,189
great Charles nice round of applause for
Charles again we're talking for every

248
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,090
once in a while I guess

249
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,090
yeah

250
00:19:21,890 --> 00:19:30,620
hello yeah again how this never gets not
nerve-racking and hi I'm Charles and I'm

251
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:36,889
responsible for the weird white cubes
are all around the camp and thank you

252
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,370
they are Lumos nodes they're also known
as what's that weird white box you put

253
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:49,429
it next to my tent it's not going to
make lots of noise is it

254
00:19:49,430 --> 00:19:53,870
I promise you there's no hidden base
speakers but i'm thinking next time

255
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,679
distributed based around the camp just
so we can drop the bass at midnight as

256
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,240
the curfew hits

257
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:04,910
I'm not sure what the organizers were
like that or not this is a project that

258
00:20:04,910 --> 00:20:10,670
actually wanted to do way back at the
first EMF and the idea was to have

259
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:15,680
distributed light around the campsite
that was running off of the same n RF

260
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:21,110
modules that the first camp bad she uses
man is going to be a nice distributed

261
00:20:21,110 --> 00:20:29,120
network of blinking leds at but then EMF
actually happened and I was responsible

262
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,120
for setting up the stages getting in all
the higher kits designing the first DMF

263
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:39,080
badge and getting manufactured driving
around in a golf buggy and delivering

264
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:44,870
stuff and and at the last moment our
caterer is pulled out and Claire and I

265
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:50,419
rented a food truck and cooked meat for
an entire weekend and then we didn't eat

266
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:53,750
meat for about three months because we
couldn't stand the smell of cooking meat

267
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,670
anymore so sadly that will have to go in
a box in the corner and he never got

268
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,450
made

269
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:06,260
so I thought as it's been a couple of
VMS time and actually try and get these

270
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:10,280
projects done that I'd never managed to
do so

271
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:15,139
yeah this year I thought I'd actually
try and make it at

272
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:20,450
I had all of the gear from the first DMF
but I thought I've got time

273
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:23,450
it's January have got a few months so

274
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:29,360
maybe I'll improve it so instead of just
using these Wi-Fi modules that are a bit

275
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,209
flaky and they can't be back very far
apart

276
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:36,140
I thought why not use Wi-Fi we've got
Wi-Fi around the camp that that will be

277
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,310
stable a nice

278
00:21:37,310 --> 00:21:42,110
this was before I heard from my friends
who made the badges this year that

279
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,530
they'd also be using 2.4 gigahertz for
the badges so it's a it's still holding

280
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,070
up

281
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:53,210
but they have to be very close to the
decays to get a nice strong signal

282
00:21:53,210 --> 00:21:59,120
that's getting past all the badges those
also the first one was going to have one

283
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,330
LED so i thought why not have three

284
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:09,110
nice and bright and also art that I
trained as a theatre technician and our

285
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:14,240
net is the network version of dmx and
DMX is the kind of control protocol that

286
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,780
you use for lighting and moving lights
and theatrical stuff

287
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:22,340
so all of these nodes can actually be
used by lighting desks so somebody

288
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,500
brought their own life and death they
could use it

289
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:32,660
they also the first version used 5am
power batteries from China that when I

290
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:36,380
tested them there were more like 500
milliamps so they wouldn't have lasted

291
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,340
long either

292
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,330
but luckily I managed to find the same
supply the Adafruit uses for their

293
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:46,909
batteries and what it's not the cheapest
they are actually the rated amount that

294
00:22:46,910 --> 00:22:51,200
they say so the new nodes now have eight
point eight and powers and then they can

295
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,900
pull quite a lot of power from them

296
00:22:53,900 --> 00:22:58,130
I thought their space on the board so
let's add a connective neopixels so they

297
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,050
can also do strips neopixels now and
before they were just going to be in

298
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:09,590
tupperware boxes i found i thought it
needs to be bigger so making boxes out

299
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,389
of trouble sacks

300
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:15,920
which sounds like a good idea until you
realize that woman plastic is like a

301
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,390
dull cheese grater

302
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:20,840
so when i'm flipping them inside out to
put into our sewing machine

303
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:25,520
my hands got ripped to shreds as I
regret that quite a lot next year or the

304
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,800
next day m-f it's gonna be different and
original was gonna be 10 but now is 50

305
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,149
around the campsite

306
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:38,270
because quantity means cheaper but I'd
also didn't factor in quantity means i'm

307
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,940
going to be sitting in front of netflix
for a lot of time I've based how long

308
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:48,440
this project is taking me mostly in
series of netflix making all of the big

309
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:55,010
cube housing was for series of deep
space nine so that that that's a quite a

310
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,480
while

311
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:05,990
this is the custom PCB that I ended up
making it's got an esp8266 runs the the

312
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,750
wireless and all of the logic for it

313
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,590
there's three boost LED drivers

314
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,590
it's got three points 7 volt lithium
iron in it

315
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:22,520
it boosts that up to about 12 volts or
so to light up the leds and then pwm is

316
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:28,190
for the nice colors and then also on the
bottom right there's a connector for

317
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:32,690
neopixel strip if you want to put those
in a non the color changing that you

318
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:36,500
seen at the moment they are going
through the rainbow

319
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:40,220
they lost about nine hours on the
batteries before i go around in the

320
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:45,380
morning and charged them all up and got
those all manufactured and brought

321
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:51,140
across and then i SAT and placed about
5,000 components by hand which is

322
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:53,390
actually quite fun

323
00:24:53,390 --> 00:25:00,410
I also realized i needed charges they're
all nice one power charges for the

324
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:04,370
batteries that let me charge them
individually rather than having to do a

325
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:05,689
whole pack slowly

326
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:10,940
i also had some space left on the PCB so
i thought why not make it an Internet of

327
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:14,270
Things because that's that's the cool
thing these days

328
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:18,620
so yeah they can tweet me once they're
finished charging

329
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:22,310
I regret being one of those people that

330
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:29,350
yeah so in my tent at the moment is a
lots and lots of challenges

331
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:33,428
I can do half of the nodes in one go and
then flip them over and do the other

332
00:25:33,429 --> 00:25:38,470
half as if you see a giant lithium fire
raging over near the dome

333
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,860
it's probably my 10 just keep a wide
berth

334
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:49,030
so yeah the housings are cheap
industrial rubber bags with bamboo canes

335
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:53,830
and webbing sewn into keep them in place
to get them structure

336
00:25:54,610 --> 00:26:01,240
luckily our sewing machine we bought it
to make course it's which means that it

337
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:06,340
can go through about an inch of leather
at speed with no problems

338
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:12,040
so it can do several layers of plastic
quite nicely mostly the only bad thing

339
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,200
about it is that it goes so fast

340
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:19,330
I'm like yeah but yes I managed to make
50 of those without killing myself

341
00:26:19,330 --> 00:26:23,320
finally killed three needles which I
feel proud about but probably should

342
00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,210
have done better

343
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:31,090
people in my local park have been
looking at me very oddly when I've been

344
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:37,240
out there at nine o'clock midnight one
side finished testing out new bits and

345
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,470
pieces

346
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:42,070
so if you're in the hammersmith area and
you saw a random guy that was me

347
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:47,649
I also built a control server for it
rather than just having a standard

348
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:54,850
artnet there's a node to jas server
which gives me an overview of all of the

349
00:26:54,850 --> 00:27:00,129
nodes they heartbeat back to the server
with their current voltage at their

350
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:05,710
settings so i can see their calibration
and then that all goes into here you can

351
00:27:05,710 --> 00:27:09,669
see which one's alive which one's of run
out of battery so i need to go and

352
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,929
charge them up

353
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:17,140
I can also enable disable them and mess
around with them and i spent far too

354
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:22,900
long making and also updating graph so i
can see as their powers running out or

355
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:27,309
if anything's wrong with them and a few

356
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:33,070
tools which I need to flesh out but I
feel like God when I'm standing up on

357
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:34,990
top of the hill

358
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:39,610
seeing all of these nodes around the
place and then just going off on off on

359
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,800
for air

360
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:45,370
yes if you see me with an ipad giggling
to myself that's that's why

361
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:54,790
yeah that there's 25 charges 15 notes
250 RGB LEDs quite a lot of stuff it

362
00:27:54,790 --> 00:27:59,050
looks more impressive when there's big
numbers but it all adds up into these

363
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:00,520
nodes that are

364
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:10,870
I hope pretty there's an open API with
the control server and if you go to any

365
00:28:10,870 --> 00:28:16,419
of these links or just search for Lummus
nodes and there's a github page with all

366
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:18,340
the details you can do

367
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:25,179
HTTP requests with Johnson data you can
get information of all the notes are

368
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:27,160
online their battery status

369
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:32,530
what color they are and then you can you
post it back and you can set the color

370
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,550
of any of them

371
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:36,790
I currently there's no api keys

372
00:28:36,790 --> 00:28:39,520
so anybody can set them and if people
are fighting they're going to change

373
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,129
color so I'd love it if anybody wants to
write some really nice stuff for the

374
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:49,150
nose around we put up 10 on the ridge
last night

375
00:28:49,150 --> 00:28:52,000
so if anybody wants to make a lasting
scanner that goes across there that

376
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:58,030
would be awesome and just hit me up on
Twitter or freenode my details are at

377
00:28:58,030 --> 00:29:01,540
the end and I'll turn off other scripts
that you can play with them once they're

378
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:07,210
running but all of the code will be open
source and open hardware and put on the

379
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:10,210
licenses yet but you'll find all of
those details on there

380
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,790
a huge thank you to Nexus interactive
arts they sponsored the project and gave

381
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,060
me some money to buy all of the hardware

382
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:25,050
they're an awesome company who work a
lot with google on their made with code

383
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:31,649
projects which is designed to get girls
young girls into coding we did the White

384
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:36,270
House's lon for their christmas trees
couple years ago where you could use

385
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:41,940
blockley which is a visual programming
language to animate their trees which is

386
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:45,690
partly where the idea for this came from
and also LED dresses and stuff

387
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:52,320
thank you to Adrian goldwind fuse around
who put up with me

388
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:55,710
poke in at one o'clock in the morning
and IRC going

389
00:29:55,710 --> 00:29:58,710
I chose the wrong drivers and they're
not working please help me

390
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:06,870
and if you're around tonight my friend
Tom Wyatt is making a vibe experience

391
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:08,939
over in the gold members lounge

392
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:16,590
it's so he's making a version of his own
visual scripting language so important

393
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:23,669
in VR and you can drag around components
make chases to color transitions and

394
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:27,030
then that all get propagated out to the
nodes that all around the place

395
00:30:27,030 --> 00:30:30,360
so if you haven't used divided before
it's a good excuse to come over and play

396
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:34,080
with one and a thank you to everybody
else who's let me their pictures for

397
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:35,100
this talk

398
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:38,070
and yet if you'd like to get involved
and I'd really love that you do because

399
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:42,689
at the moment it's just my laptop
running a rainbow chase during the night

400
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:48,150
hit me up on Twitter or on freenode I'm
sexiest and yeah that's my notes

401
00:30:54,470 --> 00:31:01,070
they say good lightning talks should be
like a comment right it should be

402
00:31:01,070 --> 00:31:05,928
dazzling and brilliant and over in a
flash and I certainly feel that that was

403
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:10,220
I like the blinking lights the shiny
lights I know other people do too

404
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:14,210
so thanks again for all of that no
apologies for not being able to put you

405
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:17,600
on yesterday and so hopefully you guys
will get out there and write some code

406
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,559
and play with the API and do some other
stuff and our next speaker is going to

407
00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:28,039
speak to us about robots i believe and
in particular dangerous things does

408
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:32,539
anyone here like danger and once again
the right hand side left hand side what

409
00:31:32,539 --> 00:31:33,590
are you doing are you sleeping

410
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,850
are you awake all right now the left
hand side non danger not in danger

411
00:31:38,570 --> 00:31:43,580
okay good so yes

412
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,360
are you ready I think so

413
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:47,969
Robert is

414
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:52,020
daddy and he's going to talk to you
about building your first combat robot i

415
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,129
believe right

416
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:56,640
music doesn't work ok huh music doesn't
work is fine

417
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,640
all right we should do you should be
able to just buy it

418
00:32:00,390 --> 00:32:03,390
yeah she's going to try the presentation
of it

419
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:16,800
ok as you wish one round of applause
Roman i have a good read i right

420
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,149
ok cool alright so this talk about
building the first combat robot

421
00:32:21,150 --> 00:32:27,810
Robert was just started back on TV it
will be on tonight 8pm bbc2 i don't know

422
00:32:27,810 --> 00:32:31,440
if you can actually get iplayer in the
10 to the on the campsite the moment

423
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:33,930
because um maybe see you think

424
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:39,960
yeah thnkx for in Germany or something
um so yeah I'm Robert

425
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,740
I've been into combat robotic stuff
since about nineteen ninety-eight which

426
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,020
for the first season started up

427
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,129
that's my website that's my twitter so
feel free to give us a poke prod later

428
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:55,260
on so I just covering my experiences I
don't profess to be any sort of

429
00:32:55,260 --> 00:33:01,170
Professor expert on this yet but I'm so
in the UK

430
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:04,140
you've got three what classes because
you've gotta split robots in two weight

431
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,130
classes

432
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:08,490
the ones you see on TV or heavy weights
right at the bottom there they cost

433
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:11,820
about a hundred what are they worried
about a hundred kilos

434
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,750
I think we've got up to a hundred and
ten kilos now for new rewards they cost

435
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,720
anywhere from two grand to about a grand

436
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:23,340
there's a lot of money so when I just
got up on stage for the way there are a

437
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:28,560
lot more cheaper so that was about a
hundred quid a 13 point 6 kilos

438
00:33:29,190 --> 00:33:32,700
it's quite popular for getting started
it's big enough that you learn how to

439
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,600
build robot

440
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,080
it's small enough that it doesn't break
the bank there's another type called me

441
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:42,330
two weights there one point three six
kilos there about 200 quid maybe or less

442
00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:44,669
and get away with a lot less for me to
wait there

443
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:48,780
they're absolutely tiny they're also
good for getting into robots if you're

444
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:51,960
into that if you want to start

445
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:57,030
so the way I look at building robots is
balanced you you'll find more money but

446
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:01,470
you won't find more weight your it's
always all just another speed control

447
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:06,300
just another motor but you have a limit
on how many grams something way you

448
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:09,300
can't change that if you can talk to me
afterwards

449
00:34:10,409 --> 00:34:14,460
so you gotta split what what you have on
your chassis

450
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,230
the thing that everything else gets
bolted into the armor that stops you

451
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:23,699
getting beaten up some sort of dr motion
system so you can actually drive around

452
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:28,919
and something to hit the other guy with
and if you focus on one of them then you

453
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,240
lose out on the others

454
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:36,060
so starting with a chassis everything
bolts to it every time you get hit it's

455
00:34:36,060 --> 00:34:38,969
going to go into the chassis so the
chassis needs to be able to take that

456
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:45,029
hit need to be kind of rigid which will
include you getting thrown up in the air

457
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,240
couple of meters and then dropping on
your weakest edge

458
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:52,859
that's me to think about where you can
be a little cheeky and make the chassis

459
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:56,460
in the arm of the same thing but then if
someone hits the arm hard enough your

460
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:59,910
chassis gets bent which means wheels
don't touch the ground

461
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:03,600
so that's what my chassis looks like
once you take away all the outside skin

462
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,250
on my little robot down here at the
front got two big motors at the top that

463
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:14,880
make it move and the big motor in the
middle makes the arm go up and down so I

464
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,970
was quite important because you're not
gonna dodge everybody

465
00:35:17,970 --> 00:35:23,520
you're always going to get hit the two
popular ones are special steal the stuff

466
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,960
they use to make bigger buckets out of
its very tough but it's very heavy

467
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,830
the other option is plastic to use
chopping boards and well

468
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:38,460
HDPE you can because it's so light you
can make it really thick and it hasn't

469
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:43,380
really weird tendency to tear rather
than stick together

470
00:35:43,890 --> 00:35:47,759
so when a big weapon hits you it just
has a chunk out of your armor rather

471
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:52,350
than tearing the armor chunk off of your
robot which is useful because it means

472
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,150
the rest the i'm still there for the
next hit

473
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:55,940
there's always another hit

474
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:59,120
you want to avoid vertical sides oops

475
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:04,670
anyone avoid sharp corners double loops
because what happens with spending

476
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:08,720
weapons they will catch these these
edges and then they will drag your robot

477
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:13,669
and throw around then if you've watched
the first episode of our wars but you

478
00:36:13,670 --> 00:36:16,130
saw the little robots getting thrown out
of the arena

479
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:20,330
yeah that was some sharp corners and
flat sides so that's what my room looks

480
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:26,630
like that covered in the thicker steel
armor and I've got polycarbonate until

481
00:36:26,630 --> 00:36:28,010
the top of the bottom

482
00:36:28,010 --> 00:36:31,340
it's not particularly strong but it is
very light and it does look cool

483
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:39,500
so motion that's all about kind of bring
big motors in even you need to have you

484
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,780
need to be able to drive around so you
can control the arena

485
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:46,040
so you can put your opponent where he
doesn't want to be and where you want

486
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:46,820
him to be

487
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:51,680
namely in front of your weapon you'll
find a lot of people are quite bad at

488
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:55,339
driving their robots and I constantly do
bad things like driving into the wall

489
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:59,750
instead of driving at the other guy or
driving into the pit and that's because

490
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,700
a lot of people don't practice enough

491
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:04,790
don't actually drive the robot is when
they're fighting it they don't take it

492
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:08,960
home and have a play around in the
garden or out in the street and it's

493
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,190
really fun so you should totally do that
these days a lot of people using

494
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:16,310
cordless drills for featherweights so
you got an to home base

495
00:37:16,850 --> 00:37:20,720
Alfred so I've got another you buy
yourself a cheap 18-volt cordless drill

496
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,980
take for the plastic a nice powerful
motor you can I scare box you got a nice

497
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:26,360
big shaft pit

498
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,850
what wheels on it's great and then for
speed controllers with there's a

499
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:36,290
australian company that takes very cheap
Chinese brushless motor controllers and

500
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,850
says we have brushed motor controllers
by changing software is the cheapest one

501
00:37:40,850 --> 00:37:45,410
out there there are others there are
better and more expensive heavier says

502
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:46,850
there's a lot of options

503
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,440
that's what mine looks like so I've got
one big motor in the back and then that

504
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,410
drives one wheel and I've got about the
drives the front wheel

505
00:37:54,410 --> 00:37:57,470
so I've got four wheels god I've got
four-wheel drive

506
00:37:57,470 --> 00:38:02,270
but with only two motors works quite
well until the belts come off and then

507
00:38:02,270 --> 00:38:04,190
it kind of

508
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:07,880
looks so weapons

509
00:38:08,839 --> 00:38:11,900
so if you have been watching your
rewards or even American battle bots

510
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,790
which is on the moment she's awesome

511
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:18,890
spinners are amazing they that they look
kind of simple because I just basically

512
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:23,359
some metal bar or desk with a tooth and
they spend it really really really fast

513
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,569
and if it hits you it kills you

514
00:38:26,569 --> 00:38:31,160
so I quite simple but that there's a lot
of nuance and it's quite hard to get

515
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:32,540
right

516
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:35,420
the other option is flippers to use
pneumatics which is something that's

517
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:39,319
been very popular in the kind of the off
television

518
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:43,430
Robot Wars that's been happening it's
probably the most effective weapon

519
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:47,720
the way the UK arena is a belt is we
have a gutter around the outside of the

520
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:48,439
arena

521
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,730
so you can throw your opponent into that
gutter they've lost and it means you

522
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:56,270
don't take damage they don't take damage
and you can win a fight in three seconds

523
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:58,160
and people have done that

524
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,598
unfortunately makes for terrible TV
which is why they've changed the arena

525
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:05,030
to not have such a big gutter now

526
00:39:05,030 --> 00:39:08,270
the other option is to be around but so
lots of armor

527
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,160
lots of big motors and just drive into
the other guy at full speed 13 kilos

528
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:16,490
running at about 20 miles an hour will
hurt

529
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:22,279
I'm i'll show you my weapon but it's
really awkward to show so i'll probably

530
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,609
have it going in a second at the end of
the talk

531
00:39:25,609 --> 00:39:31,880
so it's not very easy there is no
perfect robot you get to keep having a

532
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,660
go at it

533
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:37,399
it's quite good I mean as long as you
build it all right

534
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:43,280
it's very rare for your robot to get
torn into complete shreds see you can

535
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:47,660
iteratively tweak stuff and make it
better and fix the thing that broke last

536
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:50,660
time and most of all it's really good
fun

537
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:55,819
so for finding out about building stuff
these are places to go

538
00:39:55,819 --> 00:39:58,369
so the fighting robots to Cody case
we're pretty much all the guys from

539
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:03,800
robot wars hang out there are live
events so that stuff held leisure

540
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:04,940
centres and the like

541
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:08,569
roughly every month and a half two
months so it's worth going on to them

542
00:40:08,569 --> 00:40:13,099
either as a look-see or just to watch
robots kick the shit out of each other

543
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,630
there's the American websites park .
tools which is where a lot of the guys

544
00:40:17,630 --> 00:40:20,930
from battle bots and the other homegrown
events hang out

545
00:40:21,559 --> 00:40:25,819
you got Robert was a robot wars . com is
the Australian website

546
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:30,170
Australians have got some nice robots
going on e to the I plus 1 is this

547
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:35,329
American guy from MIT who doesn't matter
robots this worth looking out for some

548
00:40:35,329 --> 00:40:39,619
nicely vehicles so I'm from Cambridge
make space which I built most of my

549
00:40:39,619 --> 00:40:40,609
robots

550
00:40:40,609 --> 00:40:44,450
we've got some great kit and yeah find
your local hacker space is full of cool

551
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:48,259
kit to do we have any time for questions

552
00:40:50,599 --> 00:40:53,630
they go in and a half I can't see nothin

553
00:40:54,140 --> 00:41:01,190
sure my work family show family show

554
00:41:01,190 --> 00:41:07,190
haha so yeah something called a latke
which then if you can see so you need to

555
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:10,220
be able to remove that to stop it from
going out of control and hurting people

556
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:14,420
she was

557
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:29,520
yeah that can toss about 30 kilos

558
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,260
fantastic

559
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:47,550
yep excellent yeah and now we have to do
is change / I don't believe I've ever

560
00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:51,390
had to do a robot change over before
that's a that's a first for me

561
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:54,779
so we remove the robot from the stage
and our next presentation involves a

562
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,800
demo

563
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:59,850
Bob Durham is going to get up and do
something very special for us in just a

564
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:05,069
moment and and i know it involves two of
my favorite scientists right one of you

565
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,280
one of whom unified theories of time and
gravity

566
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:12,150
I'm sure you know who that is and
another one who unified theories of

567
00:42:12,150 --> 00:42:18,090
electricity and magnetism is a min ship
let's just go for it

568
00:42:18,090 --> 00:42:24,660
like who are those two gentlemen anyone
inside Maxwell fantastic right and I

569
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,779
learned recently that Einstein

570
00:42:26,779 --> 00:42:30,529
I have started the work on time because
he was trying to unify the time travel

571
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:35,059
the time tables are various railroad
stations in different time zones and so

572
00:42:35,059 --> 00:42:36,829
when he got to thinking about relativity

573
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:41,119
he had kind of already thought about the
relationship of time and distance across

574
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:42,919
multiple time zones

575
00:42:42,919 --> 00:42:46,429
hopefully we'll learn a lot more about
that stuff in the next few minutes and

576
00:42:46,429 --> 00:42:48,559
once again if you just come along

577
00:42:48,559 --> 00:42:51,979
they're desperate for volunteers at UMF
camp particularly for speaker ops this

578
00:42:51,979 --> 00:42:56,868
evening and for cooking and doing dishes
and they're offering food tokens for

579
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:01,609
people who helped out a lot of things
have been done in this kind of temporary

580
00:43:01,609 --> 00:43:06,529
autonomous zone by us and I certainly
appreciate that so maybe a warm round of

581
00:43:06,529 --> 00:43:11,089
applause for yourselves for setting up
camp and sticking it out in this tent

582
00:43:11,089 --> 00:43:14,089
while it's very very warm today so round
of applause

583
00:43:16,819 --> 00:43:20,839
are you doing on you also

584
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:25,099
yeah ok so I'm going to introduce you to
Bob and he's going to do some demos for

585
00:43:25,099 --> 00:43:27,739
you and enjoy yourselves

586
00:43:27,739 --> 00:43:33,859
good morning huh my name is Bob at today
are interesting enough

587
00:43:33,859 --> 00:43:39,288
I'm a maker primarily I used to be a
professional programmer but don't do

588
00:43:39,289 --> 00:43:40,519
that anymore

589
00:43:40,519 --> 00:43:47,538
now I go to make affairs with my mate
Dave and we call ourselves we just like

590
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:52,459
to make stuff you might have seen our
table with the chess sets that we've

591
00:43:52,459 --> 00:43:54,288
made an undiscovered

592
00:43:54,289 --> 00:43:57,650
I'm but we got together we know you have
a long time but we got together because

593
00:43:57,650 --> 00:44:01,699
we built a heavyweight robot and it's
about the size of that cabinet over

594
00:44:01,699 --> 00:44:04,819
there and now we got flipped

595
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:10,219
we got annihilated they're harder than
you think and and it did really cost us

596
00:44:10,219 --> 00:44:13,009
over 2,000 pound but great fun

597
00:44:13,009 --> 00:44:16,759
we got on the telly and those tell you
the telly competition was actually a

598
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:20,329
quarterfinal have to be a couple of
robots before they let you on so we

599
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:22,699
didn't do too bad but we were tired

600
00:44:22,699 --> 00:44:29,599
the two leading heavy I know today I
thought talk about electromagnetism now

601
00:44:30,170 --> 00:44:34,250
it's very common to assume that
everybody knows about electromagnetism

602
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:38,810
particularly an event like this but we
find that to make affairs

603
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,940
people don't know what they know little
bit and so hopefully are all them in

604
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:48,350
line and some of you and those already
know that's great

605
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:52,310
those who don't hopefully you'll leave
knowing

606
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,850
okay i'm gonna start with a couple of
classic demonstrations and then talk

607
00:44:55,850 --> 00:45:09,140
more about how they work in your
mid-back can hear me the bank mother

608
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:26,270
plastic number plate magnets stairwell
you take these tables level i can swing

609
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,890
this plastic through this

610
00:45:27,890 --> 00:45:32,540
these two magnets oops is that is that
is a stage is not level

611
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:36,830
not me as you see it's one quite freely

612
00:45:37,340 --> 00:45:45,910
this is a bit of copper and now the

613
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:49,058
they did that I did read somewhere that
you shouldn't start a presentation by

614
00:45:49,059 --> 00:45:53,920
apologizing so I apologize that you
can't see it but take this opportunity

615
00:45:53,920 --> 00:45:59,289
that if you want to see some of the
demos more closely were only up the path

616
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,490
up there at the end

617
00:46:00,490 --> 00:46:03,939
another table out after this threat for
a little while

618
00:46:04,510 --> 00:46:09,490
this is copper and it stopped

619
00:46:10,089 --> 00:46:33,460
ok that's a classic demonstration of
electromagnetism are come in and a

620
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,090
couple

621
00:46:34,090 --> 00:46:42,340
plastic wall plug Festival Park copper
pipe in this and one-handed I'm going to

622
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,260
drop the plastic through the pipe that
goes

623
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:53,860
brass bolt icon

624
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:20,360
spoke again is talking

625
00:47:21,019 --> 00:47:24,319
just a couple seconds and I've got no
slots to go wrong probably everything

626
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:25,429
else to go wrong

627
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,429
demos are hard right

628
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:34,038
we usually find one doing demos you have
to sacrifice a calculator before you get

629
00:47:34,039 --> 00:47:47,539
onstage and then everything works fine
I'll tell

630
00:47:48,339 --> 00:47:52,509
the thought experiment just think about
the little magnet my fingers and a drop

631
00:47:52,509 --> 00:47:58,450
it through the pipe now and it comes out
the bottom it drops very very slowly

632
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:01,930
it's another classic easy demonstration
of electromagnetism

633
00:48:01,930 --> 00:48:12,450
I don't want to explain what's going on
and I have

634
00:48:12,450 --> 00:48:19,348
if i pass if I make a charge electric
charge move along that wire which called

635
00:48:19,349 --> 00:48:23,160
the current i'm gonna get so i'm always
going to get something i'm always going

636
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:25,890
to get a magnetic field produced

637
00:48:25,890 --> 00:48:39,150
that's the electromagnetism bit I always
get a magnetic field which is I can

638
00:48:39,150 --> 00:48:41,250
concentrate on making if i call up the
wire

639
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:46,170
I can concentrate that magnetic field
many times it becomes very effective

640
00:48:46,829 --> 00:48:54,599
now the converse happens if I pass that
if i can make magnetic field change or

641
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,869
in the presence of an electric charge

642
00:48:57,869 --> 00:49:01,140
I can make the charge move to something
about two things now I've got three

643
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:02,040
things about

644
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:08,190
I'm electric field magnetic field and
movement

645
00:49:08,190 --> 00:49:18,900
ok so what's happening in this expert in
this demonstration is that my electric

646
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:24,150
charge was on top of the metal the metal
has has electrons that are free to move

647
00:49:24,150 --> 00:49:27,630
about their passing through this

648
00:49:27,630 --> 00:49:33,420
these two magnets a large magnetic field
and which in which caused those charges

649
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,339
to move that and that's called a scorned
eddy current ok and because it's now a

650
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:42,690
moving charge it generates his own
magnetic field which opposes that of the

651
00:49:42,690 --> 00:49:49,530
magnets and if you come up after the
start a blog and share that's that feels

652
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,530
quite sticky feels like it's going
through honey or glue or something

653
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:57,690
this is same with a copper pipe when i
drop drop drop a magnet through here

654
00:49:57,690 --> 00:50:03,359
the the passage of that the breaking of
that field causes eddy currents in the

655
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,279
pipe which then oppose the passage of
that magnet and which is what whiterun

656
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:10,170
so slowly as you saw earlier

657
00:50:10,170 --> 00:50:14,970
ok so that's that's the basics

658
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:16,509
big deal so what

659
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:23,920
well it turns out that this is
incredibly useful i have here and

660
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:29,710
apologize for you can see the back door
damn i'm gonna do that was this is this

661
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:34,870
is a coil of wire held in the frame and
round it goes this magnet

662
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:40,990
so if I if I turn that course I got the
motion

663
00:50:40,990 --> 00:50:47,080
I've got my charge carrying the wire
what am I going to get out the bank or

664
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,520
other it's in a magnetic field

665
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,120
so I'm gonna get some I'm going to get
movement of that charge

666
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:58,180
it's a generator ok on building the same
principles as this the eddy currents and

667
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:01,720
so I can generate so i can turn that
with a windmill or content with the

668
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:06,100
steam generator or my electric power
station also does this just he's water

669
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:12,310
making the steam and turn it now if if
fun if i'm going to go the other way if

670
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:17,500
i put electricity in my moving electric
charge electric fields

671
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:20,800
I've got there not got charged

672
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:24,340
I've got my magnetic field or to get out
the back motion

673
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:30,190
so for power and I get motion that's my
electric motor all for all that running

674
00:51:30,190 --> 00:51:44,460
from this basic principle of eddy
current this is normal

675
00:51:44,460 --> 00:51:50,040
it is talk I'm just one or two people
intimately here and that and they can

676
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,640
see things like this and i can ask
what's this

677
00:51:55,080 --> 00:52:02,009
I'll try it was this we can see a
connector this is a little electric

678
00:52:02,010 --> 00:52:02,849
motor

679
00:52:02,849 --> 00:52:06,390
ok and we see how that worked in my very
clear demonstration just now

680
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:12,720
does anyone know what this is it's
written on it this is a stepping motor

681
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,930
so the coils here arranged not

682
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:23,368
I'm continuously but in but I'm arranged
such that the turning motion is is quite

683
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:25,410
discreet turn to step at a time

684
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:28,859
very useful for reported control skid
turning that sort of thing

685
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:34,049
ok stepper motor made possible by modern
electronic certain control the current

686
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,540
going into each individual coil

687
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:39,900
now here's a good one

688
00:52:40,410 --> 00:52:45,810
and this usually it is usually get those
most people don't know this is this is

689
00:52:45,810 --> 00:52:47,130
our stop that sorry

690
00:52:47,130 --> 00:52:51,359
this is this is a brushless motor now
I'm sure you've all seen a lot of these

691
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:55,799
particular got drones or radical by
aircraft because they're very small very

692
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,880
powerful

693
00:52:56,880 --> 00:53:00,869
how does this work compared to the other
motor will listen in this one on both of

694
00:53:00,869 --> 00:53:05,700
these examples I've got my magnet round
the outside and it's the call of water

695
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,500
it is turning on this one

696
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:11,700
I've got coils inside and it's the
magnets and spin

697
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,779
so now we don't have to have a brush to
carry the current to the coils

698
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:21,720
I'm electromagnetic induction which
produces the turning force so very very

699
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,109
efficient very lightweight and that's
the end difference between a brushless

700
00:53:25,109 --> 00:53:29,400
motor and a brushed motor is mentioned
in the previous talking

701
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,650
we use motors that we found on the
internet for our robot and now you say

702
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,700
that they were noticeable actuators from
english electric lightnings but no one

703
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,710
really believed the Sweden will come
from

704
00:53:40,710 --> 00:53:42,599
ok

705
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:46,019
I'm getting to the interesting part

706
00:53:46,019 --> 00:53:49,019
soon

707
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:57,720
everything

708
00:53:57,720 --> 00:54:03,810
this all this always work was done by
Faraday essentially in a workshop he was

709
00:54:03,810 --> 00:54:08,580
training he trained as a bookbinder and
he was employed by Davies as in his

710
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:13,920
workshop and discovered all this says
just shows how important making is and

711
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,950
doing stuff in your shed all the
practical stuff

712
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:21,598
this this is a Faraday torch sometimes
called is there's a magnet here which

713
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:25,170
are bouncing up and down between two
Springs and to cause a wire

714
00:54:25,950 --> 00:54:30,720
this is designed so that the current
that is produced the electric charge

715
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:36,390
stored in a pasture and Jenna

716
00:54:36,390 --> 00:54:40,769
tuesday ok that's how to ride a torch
works and it's all built on the same

717
00:54:40,769 --> 00:54:52,600
principle of electromagnetic induction
here I have

718
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,600
a bit of bread board which a lot of you
will be familiar with

719
00:54:56,170 --> 00:54:59,500
I have here a throw right ring

720
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:02,620
the fair is just something that will
concentrate my magnetic field

721
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:07,779
I've got a call of wire if you remember
that a call why I officially makes a

722
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,280
magnetic field

723
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:15,250
I've also gone here at an LED and a
transistor transistor is just a switch

724
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:22,720
on my intimate demo and other thoughts
on this

725
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,859
I can show that this battery is one-half
of battery is not powerful enough to

726
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,560
like that led there's not enough juice
left in it

727
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:35,529
however if I put into this circuit what
you got the blocking our slider is a

728
00:55:35,530 --> 00:55:38,950
lovely was certainly to make I know
soldiering involved

729
00:55:38,950 --> 00:55:44,259
so push push it into this breadboard and
the light will then light the reason is

730
00:55:44,260 --> 00:55:48,370
that the battery is enough juice in it
to turn that transistor on

731
00:55:48,370 --> 00:55:54,250
don't take that point 6 volts that
current then India creates a magnetic

732
00:55:54,250 --> 00:55:57,760
field and that coil so stores energy in
in a magnetic field

733
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:02,530
however and the way things are

734
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:08,530
when the the magnetic field is that is
created wants to create his own current

735
00:56:08,530 --> 00:56:12,280
and that's backwards against the current
that's changing it that's Lindsay's lure

736
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,920
back amen

737
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:19,559
that's enough to turn that transistor
off so I've got a sec and development

738
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:23,579
field will collapse again generating a
current now I've got a secondary winding

739
00:56:23,579 --> 00:56:28,530
here which takes that current and feed
it to the light which added to the

740
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:31,020
limited parent battery lights light

741
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:37,230
this is called a and then and then
because there's no back MF the

742
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:41,190
transistor then turn on again and the
whole cycle starts again this is called

743
00:56:41,190 --> 00:57:01,829
a blocking our selection oscillates
about some a thousand Hertz preparations

744
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:07,930
a lot preparation is the key this is
another example and it's called a mini

745
00:57:07,930 --> 00:57:09,339
Tesla coil

746
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:15,490
this is exactly the same thing except
that my coils my two calls on my right

747
00:57:15,490 --> 00:57:22,330
ring and now in a fraud and I've got one
of my one of my IM coils the pickup coil

748
00:57:22,330 --> 00:57:25,480
has many many more turns than the
original coil

749
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:33,850
this is effectively a transformer it'll
transform the power output voltage

750
00:57:33,850 --> 00:57:41,140
output into it into a higher voltage and
this is demonstrated by the fact that

751
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:45,549
here are not using LEDs i'm actually
using neons neons what we used to have

752
00:57:45,550 --> 00:57:51,970
those leds in the old days before these
were invented these little tubes of gas

753
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,859
the arcade about 90 volts I'm running
out from a 9-volt battery so you can see

754
00:57:56,860 --> 00:57:59,950
that just by using induction and
changing number of terms between those

755
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:02,980
two worm coils of wire

756
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:06,940
I can get i can get at least 90 pots
after that and you see all those lights

757
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:07,840
being lit

758
00:58:07,840 --> 00:58:12,100
what you can't see is that these are all
the legs of these new ones are joined

759
00:58:12,100 --> 00:58:15,190
together in a kind of w shape and on
this end

760
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,330
there's nothing there's nothing nothing
connects to it

761
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:26,259
how are those being lit well the answer
is in the previous circuit

762
00:58:26,260 --> 00:58:30,010
it's an oscillator this one is
oscillating at about 1 megahertz

763
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:37,000
now that is a radio frequency and so
essentially all those neurons are acting

764
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:44,200
as an antenna and the oscillating
electric wave is coming out the end and

765
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:45,819
disappearing off into space

766
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:49,000
ok and we see that's working

767
00:58:49,510 --> 00:58:54,580
you have taken me that that's not a
joint i can i can shorten like that last

768
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:57,940
one the battery is a bit bit loan

769
00:58:57,940 --> 00:59:03,339
I'm sure

770
00:59:04,569 --> 00:59:09,849
all right yes I'm let off

771
00:59:09,849 --> 00:59:14,680
it's not exciting but let me um this is
this is an antenna

772
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:21,129
this is a man Duda yagi antenna Buddha
was the student

773
00:59:21,130 --> 00:59:25,960
yeah and yogi was his supervisor but he
gets his name on this is sometimes

774
00:59:25,960 --> 00:59:27,579
people call these yagi antennas

775
00:59:27,579 --> 00:59:32,349
now i want to mention this because this
is this is part of an electromagnetic

776
00:59:32,349 --> 00:59:37,660
system this antenna is tuned and it's
tuned to two different frequencies

777
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:43,839
determined determined by the length of
these other these arms

778
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:47,140
this is called a dipole antenna

779
00:59:47,140 --> 00:59:52,359
it's got when fully assembled it's got
to us some more radial arms

780
00:59:52,359 --> 00:59:55,900
there are two meters and it's for
satellite communication basically 70

781
00:59:55,900 --> 01:00:01,150
centimeters up two meters down so you
can communicate with satellites using

782
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:05,380
this all based on that principle of firm
electromagnetism

783
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,910
I didn't get to Mentor the arm

784
01:00:10,420 --> 01:00:15,430
how many seconds coming up well I think
we should probably cut off their replies

785
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:19,660
the next speakers need to come in but
Bob does have a demo a table somewhere

786
01:00:19,660 --> 01:00:20,920
in the camp where is that

787
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:26,050
yeah haha well no no you stay upstairs

788
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,109
it's just that it's just on a path ok so
i don't know why don't you invite people

789
01:00:29,109 --> 01:00:33,430
to come and see your demo which is on
which passed it sits up near the

790
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:37,779
successful camping just on the corner
there so it's not the main one of these

791
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,300
paved part up here

792
01:00:40,300 --> 01:00:44,109
fantastic so just keep an eye out for
the demo and I see Bob again i'm going

793
01:00:44,109 --> 01:00:46,060
to talk about you sorry that's about all
that's right

794
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:49,060
one round of applause thanks Bob

795
01:00:49,569 --> 01:00:54,310
you're too kind too generous thing after
admit that is the most matter

796
01:00:54,310 --> 01:00:59,109
presentation i think i've ever seen
about EMF at amf so that was kind of

797
01:00:59,109 --> 01:01:03,369
fantastic and and apologies to the three
lightning talk speakers who didn't get a

798
01:01:03,369 --> 01:01:07,900
chance to speak this year but again meet
them outside and go and have demos

799
01:01:07,900 --> 01:01:09,400
inside the little camps

800
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:13,030
that's part of what EMF is about is just
doing it anywhere

801
01:01:13,030 --> 01:01:17,530
sit down and have a conversation and
learn some stuff from each other and and

802
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:20,260
thank you again for coming and seeing
all the Lightning talks speakers

803
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:23,530
I've had a difficult time because i
usually work in circus and Alaskan

804
01:01:23,530 --> 01:01:27,730
cabaret keeping it clean so particular
with the Faraday torch

805
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:32,650
you know I found that that was a notable
sort of moment for me and so thanks for

806
01:01:32,650 --> 01:01:33,490
coming if you did
