1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,410
alright so the next we've got

2
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:15,860
is

3
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:19,788
Theriot and it's how is the universe
like a light bulb so a big hand please

4
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,288
good afternoon everyone you're having a
good EMF camp

5
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,610
excellent so what I'm going to be doing
is kind of a bit of a cross between a

6
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:45,469
physics talk and a comedy show so who in
here enjoys watching comedy a excellent

7
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:49,430
excellent who and here enjoys watching
physics talks

8
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:55,519
hey you in here likes niver excellent
you all into my place

9
00:00:56,180 --> 00:01:02,090
I'm know that this is a bit of an
experiment and as such i'm going to say

10
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:06,530
well I'm my aims of the experiment heart
out the front which is a good

11
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,869
experimental practice idea actually want
to be doing a double blind experiment to

12
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:14,899
see whether or not this was a good way
of transmitting physics

13
00:01:14,899 --> 00:01:18,799
so I was going to try and put in a
second event which is going to have the

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:25,729
exact same title but be contemporary
dance but luckily that turned out to be

15
00:01:25,729 --> 00:01:31,369
too much bass so you are excused on that
but what I'm going to be doing is I'm

16
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,690
going to be talking through some stuff
with and basically linking get through

17
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,009
the physics

18
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:42,020
so things like how is universe like a
light bulb all

19
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:45,289
how is you might you might know this one
already this is an old joke

20
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:53,060
how is duct tape like the boss and they
are answers joke is it has a light side

21
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:58,310
and a dark side and it holds the
universe together and no no it's all

22
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,920
comparison that you might make another
famous one is how is a raven like a

23
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,259
writing desk and there are a couple of
almost canonical answers to this one of

24
00:02:09,258 --> 00:02:16,429
them is they're both in key and no one
is powe wrote on both but because i'm

25
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:20,329
coming at this from a physical
perspective I think the answer is both

26
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:24,380
bizarrely and made of exactly the same
constituent parts and obey the same

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,609
physical laws

28
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:29,720
despite being really very obviously
different and if you don't mean

29
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,790
obviously different then

30
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:36,950
yeah there's no hope I'm sorry you have
to leave it there but there's so many

31
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:41,510
things that are linked by the physics
underlying them and I was a bit

32
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:46,429
disappointed a while back I was reading
the garden Guardian education blog and

33
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:47,300
they had a letter

34
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,379
well an email i assume that had been
written in by someone who is choosing

35
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:58,640
her a-level subjects and she said I
don't want to do physics because I've

36
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,679
been doing physics and biology GCSE and
biology just seems so much more relevant

37
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,930
to my everyday life learning about
things like stem cells and I think if

38
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:13,459
we've got to the point where the subject
of physics which is literally about how

39
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:17,810
everything in the universe works is not
relevant to your everyday life

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,709
then we're doing something badly wrong

41
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:27,110
also if you're doing if your everyday
life requires stem cells when you're

42
00:03:27,110 --> 00:03:31,519
doing your gcse's then it's possible you
might also be doing something wrong

43
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:37,670
so I wanted to put this together and
kind of bring all of the different

44
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:41,510
things together and also a lot of physic
talks they're all they're all about

45
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:46,010
astrophysics all about particle physics
and they're brilliant but there's such a

46
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:50,959
lot so much more to physics and I wanted
to kind of talk about some of the always

47
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,280
nitty-gritty they're often gets lost so
I i hope you'll appreciate all of that

48
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,940
so we're going to start with is how is
around about like a space station

49
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,609
1 answer that i have heard is a lot of
Americans haven't seen either of these

50
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:16,680
and don't honestly believe that they
exist but there is one that them as

51
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,918
anyone here driven through milton keynes

52
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:26,820
yeah did you enjoy driving through
milton keynes know now it are used to go

53
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,780
and there's a bus between cambridge and
oxford that I've been on called the x5

54
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,369
and it for some reason it did it goes
from Milton Keynes and all that you get

55
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:41,550
all the way through is getting shot to
one side and shoved back to the other as

56
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:46,830
you come out to the roundabouts and this
is this

57
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,710
don't understand this you've got to kind
of like we're going to use some actual

58
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:53,940
technical physical terms here because
most of the time in your life we talked

59
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,469
about how to speed

60
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:59,669
something is moving at but what we
really care a lot of time bout is its

61
00:04:59,669 --> 00:05:05,070
velocity which is just a speed plus the
direction direction is really important

62
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,219
because if say i was wondering out
outside and then you said

63
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:12,479
which way is it to the toilets and I
said oh it's okay

64
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:15,630
there are only 300 meters away

65
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:19,860
and think of your direction I am giving
you not enough information is the same a

66
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:23,640
lot of time physics we need directions
as well and so technically the

67
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:28,950
definition of acceleration is a change
in velocity so it can be a change in

68
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:33,510
speed or it can be a change in the
direction and so in when we go around

69
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:34,530
the roundabout

70
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,520
because we're changing direction we are
accelerating and it seems to be this

71
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,340
weird link between acceleration and
being thrown about and feeling feeling

72
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,960
being pulled somewhere

73
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:50,130
so I'd like to do a bit of an experiment
with all of you

74
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:53,370
this is just a force experiment so it
doesn't require you to be from your

75
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:58,140
chairs and I just like you to imagine
that after this talk

76
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:02,910
you can wear out you had a fun rest of
the year and a half and then you went to

77
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:05,580
bed and then you woke up

78
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,450
bizarrely in what looks like a lift

79
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:13,200
you have no idea how you got there
perhaps you party too hard at the bar

80
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:19,590
tonight and you are just there stood on
the bottom of the lift and you think

81
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,520
that's usual

82
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,359
that's what normally happens I'm stood
on something I can feel the ground

83
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,680
pushing up against me

84
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:31,500
this is usual but since you don't know
how you got there something else might

85
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,430
be happening

86
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:38,400
you might be out in deep space where
you're so far away from all the other

87
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,520
stars and planets that the force of
gravity is negligible almost zero and

88
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,789
all that's happening instead is you
would be floating apart from the fact

89
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:52,770
that your rocket ship is constantly
accelerating in one direction so to you

90
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:59,010
it feels like there's gravity pushing
you away from that but then if you're in

91
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:02,280
the left something bad happens

92
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:08,190
the lift cable snaps the live starts
falling down and you start falling down

93
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,460
at the same rate as the left you at you
you lose contact the floor and just

94
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:17,430
floating floating there is a lift
plummets heading towards what seems

95
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,139
inevitable

96
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,530
at this point you're probably hoping
very much that you are actually in the

97
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:27,119
rocket ship and in fact all that's
happened is a rocket ship has stopped

98
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,639
accelerating leaving you free to float
around in zero g and it was this kind of

99
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,120
equivalence between acceleration and
gravity that caused eyes and using the

100
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,779
cause

101
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,449
albert einstein to actually come up with
his general theory of relativity which

102
00:07:45,449 --> 00:07:49,889
is basically a theory of relativity
number two the first one was special

103
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:52,139
because it involved gravity

104
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:56,400
why that make something special is an
answer there is lost in the mists of

105
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,560
time so i think so

106
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:08,550
when Einstein did this he realized that
actually gravity did more than that

107
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,610
oops i mean it's just . slides on

108
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:16,199
he realized that gravity did more than
that because in theory of relativity

109
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,089
healing space and time and in the
general Philip very of relativity

110
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:27,629
he put gravity into the mix in that
warped space-time which is of course a

111
00:08:27,629 --> 00:08:31,979
really poor naming system by I'm saying
is literally just taking space and time

112
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,838
and ramen together

113
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,099
I wonder whether or not Einstein was at
the time you thinking about this

114
00:08:38,099 --> 00:08:45,209
getting slightly angry because and
perhaps even eaten a ham bread which I'm

115
00:08:45,209 --> 00:08:47,189
sure is what you would have called a ham
sandwich

116
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:53,880
so he's got all that is put it all
together and oh one thing you might not

117
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:59,699
know the mathematics all relativity gets
very complicated and Einstein was the

118
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:05,640
master of the humble brag because he
said no matter what your problems are

119
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,319
with mathematics

120
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:14,040
do not worry for mine are far greater
i'm not i'm not struggling with that low

121
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,540
level mathematics

122
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm struggling with the really epic
mathematics say than that and under you

123
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:27,180
eat food as he wrote some equations
which are basically the old einstein's

124
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:31,120
field equations and some of these
described kind of

125
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:39,160
how the universe changed over time and
Einstein actually joining this was an

126
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:43,360
awful awful scientists because the
results that came out of this

127
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:49,720
we're not what he wanted they basically
said I've a well they basically said all

128
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:55,180
of the matter and energy in the universe
will effectively be pulling back inwards

129
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:59,920
and so the universe will be up be
shrinking or if it was already going out

130
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,540
words that would at least be
decelerating come back in and Einstein

131
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:10,060
didn't like that so he put in what we
put call in physics in a very technical

132
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:12,339
term a fudge factor

133
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:17,800
he had literally no idea what this was
it was just because he wanted the

134
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,380
universe to be unchanged and eternal he
had no explanation for that

135
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:30,760
he later called it his greatest mistake
but we'll come back to that later as to

136
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:38,740
why it might not actually have been his
greatest mistake but the other thing

137
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,070
about this is that we've kind of got a
long way from our initial point which is

138
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:47,589
that acceleration and gravity are
completely linked in the last in

139
00:10:47,589 --> 00:10:51,310
situations you cannot tell the
difference between them and these this

140
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:56,500
picture of space stations is actually
one that was kind of drawn for NASA as a

141
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:59,709
suggestion of what future space stations
might look like

142
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:04,239
as you can see there long cylinders are
pointing towards the Sun to always pick

143
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:09,670
up things and solar power but what you
can't see because it's still picture is

144
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,849
that these would be rotating and so you
have basically exactly the same

145
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:20,350
situation as a car going around the
roundabout you would feel yourself as

146
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,980
you know is going constantly around the
roundabout pushed out towards the side

147
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:28,029
and that is what you would feel inside
the space station

148
00:11:28,779 --> 00:11:34,060
so this variable gravity doesn't just
link roundabouts and space stations but

149
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,650
also link some too

150
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,870
so they'll come back to later which is
just the fate of the entire universe

151
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:46,420
so the next one starting again little
close to home

152
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:54,100
how is a streetlamp the opposite a light
from a distant planet

153
00:11:54,730 --> 00:12:00,220
now this is a very specific type of
street lamp who he recognizes this team

154
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:02,860
can tell me what element is using it

155
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:07,779
sodium yes this is a sodium streetlamp
firms to those you are watching earlier

156
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:13,060
cat was talking about sodium lights
being used in film special effects and

157
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:16,119
reason that they were used is because
they put out

158
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:20,320
technically a few but only one very very
close

159
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:28,600
colors of yellow light and the reason
they do this is down to quantum

160
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:33,130
mechanics and I realize I'm pushing a
bit in that i'm only about 15 minutes

161
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,779
into this and I've already gone through
relativity and quantum mechanics you can

162
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:43,660
like the big theories of the 20th
century but it's not as complicated as

163
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,850
sometimes it can be made a sound

164
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:49,330
you can have lots of people talking
about Schrodinger's cat and is it half

165
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:53,950
dead are half alive or is it both dead
and alive until you look at it and

166
00:12:53,950 --> 00:12:58,360
there's lots of quantum weirdness like
that but the thing about quantum physics

167
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,200
is we've tested it really rather well

168
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:10,719
and we know that it's weird but
eventually we know how weird it is we

169
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,000
can quantify that witness and that means
we can use it and you can use it for

170
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,950
example to tell us what will happen when
you put has electricity into a sodium

171
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,410
light and what we've got there is what
I've got one equation followers which is

172
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:31,390
the Schrodinger equation which is kind
of the key equation of quantum mechanics

173
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,180
don't worry there are many equations
here but basically are on the right hand

174
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,630
side you've got

175
00:13:38,630 --> 00:13:43,939
the energy of a state and on the left
hand side the far left bit you've got

176
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:49,430
basically some fundamental constants the
mass of whatever it is you're looking at

177
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,469
and a mathematical operator which some
of you may or may not recognize and

178
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:57,560
that's kind of that's kind of just a
quantum mechanical way of looking at

179
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:03,380
some things motion the v term on the
other hand is a little bit more

180
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:10,910
it basically says insert the rest of
physics here all of the rest of the

181
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:14,839
physics is basically combined into that
one B term there

182
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:18,980
this is actually a great frustration to
some people because obviously the rest

183
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:24,140
of physics includes gravity and we still
haven't worked out really how to

184
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:29,420
properly get that in there we can't get
relativity and quantum physics two play

185
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:33,920
nicely together but when we're looking
at that that's that's everything we're

186
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,209
looking at a solid

187
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:38,630
that's basically saying look at the
effects of all of the other surrounding

188
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:42,890
atoms electrons in that the electric
field we put up our cross things

189
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:48,740
basically not inside a particle inside
of an atom in a sin to its all of the

190
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:52,460
forces a strong and weak force which
involved inside the nucleus in various

191
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:59,420
cases but mostly it's going to be
electric and magnetic fields and that is

192
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:04,130
what's going to change things inside our
sodium light but no there's a funny

193
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,800
outcome of this equation which is
basically that we have very few specific

194
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:15,020
energy levels for things this is in fact
well I quantum mechanics gets its name

195
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:20,780
it comes from the word quanta which
effectively translates as a bit of stuff

196
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:27,099
and so in quantum mechanics we could
have only very specific sizes of stuff

197
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,240
in this case it's the energy of the
electrons inside the sodium light

198
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:37,540
they said in very specific energy levels
and when we jump up when we want to give

199
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:41,920
them some power by basically switching
to comment on what the electron will

200
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,979
jump up to a higher energy level and
will then fall back down again some

201
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,170
random time later

202
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,550
and when it does so it's got to give up
that energy somehow and how it does that

203
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:00,699
is by emitting a particle of light or a
photon and it turns out that the color

204
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:07,030
of the light that you see depends on the
energy of this photon and because we've

205
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:14,290
got just one size energy gap we get one
specific color of light coming out of

206
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:19,449
our lamb and so so why do we why do we
even use this in lamps and the answer is

207
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:25,270
because we're cheap at this like this
color lie is actually picked up really

208
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:30,100
well by our eyes and because it's doing
going this way

209
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:33,400
basically most of the energy that we put
in through these lights are coming out

210
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:39,459
as the light and it means that we can
use less energy in order light and our

211
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:44,710
streets at night and we can still see
really well but you might wonder what

212
00:16:44,710 --> 00:16:50,230
does that got to do with light from
distant planets and it

213
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,280
this is the kind of the opposite and we
have to have to take a step back and

214
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,290
look at distant stars first

215
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:02,410
so in these distant stars we've got a
huge giant balls of plasma and light is

216
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:05,889
being produced in the center of the star
is kind of making his way out is being

217
00:17:05,890 --> 00:17:08,890
absorbed its being we admitted loads and
loads of times

218
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:14,349
but eventually it's got to come out past
the router bits of the star and there

219
00:17:14,349 --> 00:17:19,329
are some gases there as well and what we
have exactly the same situation we have

220
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,550
gases with specific energy levels but
different energy levels because they're

221
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:28,780
different chemicals the electrons inside
them are bound to the nucleus

222
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:36,820
differently so we get we can see when we
look at these distant stars we see a big

223
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:43,030
spectrum of light just as we see from
the Sun but there are some gaps because

224
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:46,540
basically what's happening there is
light is coming out of the Sun but it's

225
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:50,770
trying to get get through this gas is
coming out towards imagine you are now

226
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:56,050
representing earth a lot of pressure on
such a small group of people but their

227
00:17:56,050 --> 00:18:03,730
way and i will be a distant star and now
is gas in front of me and the lesser

228
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:05,440
light goes into that gas

229
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:10,720
some of it gets absorbed it's a right
energy to actually make an electron jump

230
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,059
up an energy level it precisely matches
that gap but then when it gets we

231
00:18:16,059 --> 00:18:19,960
admitted it can get we admitted in a
completely different direction to where

232
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:23,740
it was coming from originally is coming
at you but now it might instead be going

233
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,350
in that direction it might be going back
into the star

234
00:18:26,350 --> 00:18:29,949
it might be going somewhere else and so
most of the light that was coming at you

235
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,840
of that specific allure color that is
being absorbed will never reach you

236
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:41,950
and so we see these gaps in the spectrum
these dark lines where we'd expect

237
00:18:41,950 --> 00:18:47,740
normally to see a color but we can go
one further than that because we've been

238
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,530
detecting exoplanets recently

239
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:53,200
have any of you seen the news about all
the exoplanets that we think the Kepler

240
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,080
mission have been detecting yeah

241
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,240
one of the ways that has been done is
basically just a planet passing in front

242
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:07,120
of the star and blocking out a tiny tiny
bit of the light that's coming towards

243
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,209
us and we actually have sensors which
are fine enough we can actually detect

244
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:16,929
the dimming as the planet passes in
front of its star

245
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:22,260
but even more than that when a star
passes in front

246
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:28,860
ok when a planet passes in front of the
star so does apply its atmosphere and

247
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:34,260
that's made up of gases as well and so
some of the light will be absorbed by

248
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,309
the atmosphere and again scattered in
lots of different direction so it won't

249
00:19:38,309 --> 00:19:39,418
come to us

250
00:19:39,419 --> 00:19:44,940
so what we're seeing is not just dimming
of light due to the planet physically

251
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,740
blocking the light

252
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,190
we're also seeing some doing because the
light going into that planet's

253
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:54,960
atmosphere and then being sent off in a
different direction and the frequency

254
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,760
and hence color of that light

255
00:19:56,760 --> 00:20:02,640
depends on what's inside that's planet's
atmosphere and so we can tell what's

256
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,500
there

257
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:10,409
ok I don't think excited enough we can
detect atmospheres and planets in other

258
00:20:10,409 --> 00:20:16,530
solar systems by the light that is
blocking from a distant star forget jet

259
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:17,428
packs

260
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:22,500
we are living in the future now and
we're hoping that we are actually be

261
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:28,890
able soon to recognize some of the some
of the molecules or compounds that we

262
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:31,950
associate with life as well

263
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:38,159
all from just a slight dimming of that
light being captured from the light from

264
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:42,600
the star being captured by those
molecules and admitted in a completely

265
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,370
different direction

266
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:49,709
according to the rules of quantum
physics and I think this is a really

267
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:57,000
exciting there and it's all coming from
this key equation of quantum physics

268
00:20:57,809 --> 00:21:02,970
so I mean that's pretty awesome and I'm
looking forward to seeing what comes out

269
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:03,900
later

270
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,990
no next

271
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:17,480
how is the sound of formula 1 like light
from distant stars and the sound of

272
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,320
formula 1

273
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,909
I don't mean the sort of sound which
involves that lots of rich people

274
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:28,100
sponsoring teams and money possibly
being used in dubious ways

275
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:33,649
well I mean is the sound that you hear
while stood next to the track and I want

276
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,630
to recreate that sound here

277
00:21:35,630 --> 00:21:40,940
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
. sweep across the entire audience and

278
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:45,980
what I'd like you to do is I'd like you
to make the sound of a formula 1 car

279
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,230
going past

280
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:51,230
on the count of three one two three

281
00:21:56,740 --> 00:22:00,940
ok

282
00:22:01,510 --> 00:22:05,020
and so what we've got there is the
Doppler effect

283
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:12,010
this is something which i'm sure most of
you will recognize and be able to talk

284
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:16,179
about but I am aware that for some
people in here some people might not

285
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:19,840
have actually got to this point in
school and for some people i know

286
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,439
GCSE or low level physics was a long
long time ago

287
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,690
so can I have a volunteer please come on
the stage

288
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:34,899
it's ok you know you're not going to do
anything complicated than that

289
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:38,260
please go to the stage big round of
applause for volunteer please

290
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:51,820
ok thank you so if you could just take
one end of this slinky and just take a

291
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,990
few steps back

292
00:22:52,990 --> 00:23:00,880
so we've got it basically taught so i'm
sure most of you are aware that sound is

293
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,600
vibrations in the air and why I'm going
to be doing is I'm going to be using

294
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:09,580
this slinky to represent those you can
imagine can I each bring a slink a

295
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:15,428
slinky being a molecule inside the air
and when I'm talking and it's going on

296
00:23:15,429 --> 00:23:19,270
the speaker's what's happening is we're
getting a vibration back and forth and

297
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:24,010
some in some places the slinky is
getting tighter than humans are getting

298
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:28,690
closer together and in other places
they're getting stretched out and that

299
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:34,929
those compressions and stretches are
traveling down the slinky also getting

300
00:23:34,929 --> 00:23:40,390
reflected at the other end there there
which we know is a function of waves of

301
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:44,440
which sound is one but that's a fine if
I'm just standing still

302
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:50,740
if I start menacingly approaching Sarah
all of as I'm pushing this back and

303
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,640
forwards

304
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,940
you'll notice that the areas of with
other again

305
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:59,830
the as I'm getting closer the areas of
bits we just squished together are

306
00:23:59,830 --> 00:24:04,360
getting closer to each other and the
areas of stretch are also getting closer

307
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,229
to each other

308
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:08,630
where is if i'm doing that while I'm
reversing

309
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:11,630
they're getting further apart

310
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:22,640
thank you very much a big round of
applause my phones in you and so we're

311
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,230
basically what we've got there is a
Doppler effect in action as I was moving

312
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:31,250
closer to the person who is hearing the
sound the sound waves were getting

313
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:35,630
squashed together we call the wavelength
which is about equivalent to the gap

314
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,630
between the squish together regions
where is getting smaller

315
00:24:39,140 --> 00:24:43,370
the frequency of those getting too
obviously was getting higher and the

316
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:49,189
picture sound goes up which in the case
of the sound of formula 1 is the knee

317
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:55,400
whereas when they go past we get them
spread it the waves spreading out the

318
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,770
frequency going down and we get the
album to again

319
00:25:00,770 --> 00:25:06,050
technical terms but one interesting
thing is that you get that weird

320
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,730
continuum between them

321
00:25:07,730 --> 00:25:14,750
it doesn't go me Alma gosney I'll and
slides along the way one way I've heard

322
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:23,780
of explaining this is this only happens
because the f1 car doesn't hit you and

323
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,610
this is because when it's coming

324
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,899
almost every toward you its speed with
the way back to the directions being

325
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,060
important again all of its speed is in
toward you and so that gives you a

326
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:38,540
higher pitch but as it's getting closer
to you

327
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:42,139
less than a smaller and smaller
component of that speed is actually

328
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:46,730
coming to watch you it's going past
things going past you don't change the

329
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,410
frequency and so as it's going down
there getting close and close to you

330
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,980
the amount of which sound is Doppler
shifted get smaller and smaller and

331
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:58,730
smaller and then as it's going away from
you the opposite happens as it gets

332
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:02,630
further and further away the Doppler
effect gets bigger and bigger and bigger

333
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:05,630
and the frequency goes down even more

334
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:12,230
but this means that when you're watching
all the kindly old films and kind of

335
00:26:12,230 --> 00:26:17,360
looking at World War two documentaries
the scary sound of the bomb falling is

336
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,760
not the one that you think it is

337
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,379
the scary sound of a bomb falling is not
the one the slides it's a one that is

338
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,700
just a whistle

339
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:31,850
which sounds exactly the same as you are
hearing in because that means it's

340
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:39,409
coming directly towards you and this
often happens happens for a lot of their

341
00:26:39,410 --> 00:26:44,450
different waves including light

342
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:48,950
his light is an electromagnetic wave is
got oscillations in the electric field

343
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:52,670
in one direction and in the magnetic
field basically at 90 degrees in that

344
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:58,730
direction and it can have the Doppler
effect two things at the same way but

345
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,450
the reason you don't see it when our
projector screen is wobbling back and

346
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:07,580
forth is because light is very very fast
and basically what you need to get to an

347
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:11,060
appreciable fraction of it in order to
be able to see it

348
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:17,720
so what so we don't have anything really
hear that is going to be going fast

349
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:22,430
enough on this planet to be able to see
it but we can look at these distant

350
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:28,640
stars and we can look to see where the
light is Doppler shifted good but

351
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,930
compared to what

352
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,220
how are we going to tell the difference
between light being changing frequency

353
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:39,770
because a star is going towards us or
like that was just that color when the

354
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:44,810
star admitted there anyway and this is
where all of the spectra that we were

355
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:48,620
just talking about coming useful because
when we were talking about the sodium

356
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,370
lights

357
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:54,919
it wasn't quite just one yellow line it
was a few different types of yellow

358
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,340
which were very close together in
frequency and so

359
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:04,409
they have very specific gaps between
them and so we can help

360
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:09,180
look at the lights come from these
distant stars and look for those patents

361
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:14,190
in the light that has been absorbed by
the gases around them and so we can

362
00:28:14,190 --> 00:28:20,550
therefore measure whether or not they're
moving towards or away from us and a guy

363
00:28:20,550 --> 00:28:31,440
called edwin hubble in 1929 did this and
noticed that for basically every star in

364
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,380
the galaxy that was not our own

365
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,580
the light was being redshifted it was
moving towards a red and inspection

366
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:43,740
which is the same as going to a lower
frequency and so the objects were moving

367
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,140
away but more than that he discovered
that the further away

368
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:56,310
this galaxy was the faster it seem to be
moving there was a linear dependence

369
00:28:56,310 --> 00:28:59,760
between these two things and we call
this

370
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,820
Hubble's law he was actually the first
one to notice this

371
00:29:03,390 --> 00:29:08,820
actually there was a guy called george
lemaitre who actually published results

372
00:29:08,820 --> 00:29:10,679
about this

373
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:15,720
two years earlier but he had something
of a disadvantage

374
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:22,560
he was French now that that wasn't this
advantage disadvantage was any published

375
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:29,399
his paper in obscure French journal
which meant that something French wasn't

376
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,890
really being read as much in scientific
journals by that time and so people just

377
00:29:34,890 --> 00:29:40,080
in me that whereas Edwin Hubble's paper
on it got distributed and science is all

378
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:43,649
about not just getting your results but
sharing them with the wider scientific

379
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:49,800
community and so poor the measure not
only did he not have his paper read it

380
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:55,530
was later translated into English and
the translator left out

381
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:02,399
some of the key bits about this because
what we don't know but possibly because

382
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:06,149
they matched what Edwin Hubble had
already published in english and so even

383
00:30:06,149 --> 00:30:12,539
then he didn't get the recognition of
actually discovering this first but

384
00:30:12,539 --> 00:30:16,860
going back to the idea of Hubble's law
it does just luck

385
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:21,629
like all other galaxies just really hate
us and have been trying to get away of

386
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,169
us was basically you were if you want
i'm back

387
00:30:25,169 --> 00:30:30,750
they've been trying to get away from us
all the way back until a point where it

388
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:34,590
looks like they were basically on top of
us and this was on the first evidence

389
00:30:34,590 --> 00:30:40,799
for the theory of the Big Bang the idea
that the entire universe basically

390
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:44,970
started in one . and has been expanding
from there ever since

391
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:53,549
but there's still another few twist to
this tale which is that one inside this

392
00:30:54,360 --> 00:31:00,750
we've looked at the acceleration and
we've been measuring it over time and we

393
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:05,340
expected based on Einstein's theory of
relativity that the acceleration

394
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,899
if they were going out the acceleration
must be decreasing because of all the

395
00:31:09,899 --> 00:31:14,039
mass and energy pulling everything back
in words but when we look at the

396
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,889
measurements we don't see this

397
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:21,330
we see I'm not entirely up to date with
what we see as i believe was still a

398
00:31:21,330 --> 00:31:29,730
small acceleration out the universe is
expanding faster than it should and so

399
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:34,080
Einstein is cosmological constant of
fudge factor that he put in these

400
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,220
equations

401
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:41,100
it turns out we needed that we needed a
bit bigger than he put it put it in

402
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:46,019
there and they're not so can be
competing theories as to what this

403
00:31:46,019 --> 00:31:52,380
actually is and some people say it might
be the energy of the vacuum in quantum

404
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:57,269
physics your ground state has some
energy and it might be this which is

405
00:31:57,269 --> 00:32:01,139
causing space to expand but there's a
slight problem with that

406
00:32:01,139 --> 00:32:05,189
and that's formed particle physics
measurements

407
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:10,860
we've got quite a good idea of how big
this should be and if we compare that to

408
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:15,539
the size of how big it should be for
astronomical purposes

409
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:20,789
there's an error of 10 to the power 120

410
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:25,889
that's a one we have a hundred and
twenty 0 is activated which is really

411
00:32:25,889 --> 00:32:32,908
rather embarrassing and we don't know
why we still don't know what this is

412
00:32:33,450 --> 00:32:40,590
and then there are lots of theories
going around but fundamentally we just

413
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,620
don't know this is still an active bit
of research and so we've come a long way

414
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:53,939
from the same effect which gives us the
sound of f1 cars going past an ambulance

415
00:32:53,940 --> 00:33:01,260
siren is it going past two boys now one
of the biggest mysteries of the universe

416
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,960
why is accelerating and that we still
don't know

417
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:15,000
ok how you all how you're doing you are
following a moment there

418
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,620
yeah it's good and what I like say we've
gone through some of the biggest bits of

419
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:25,168
science there but now for this next bit
i am actually going to get you all

420
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:30,899
involved because i have here a set of
elastic bands and i'm just going to

421
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,379
throw these out lately told you might
need some help getting to the at the

422
00:33:34,379 --> 00:33:39,330
back and if you could all just grab one
of these passive and share them around

423
00:33:39,330 --> 00:33:42,330
that would be brilliant

424
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:57,250
and yes you can just pass those all
around because what we're moving on to

425
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:07,240
next is how is an elastic band like a
fridge and for this I'm going to have to

426
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,460
be asking all of you to take an elastic
bands and make your own observation

427
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:17,889
so those of you who've got them widely
to do is I'd like you to take elastic

428
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:22,480
band into hands and hold it up so that
is just touching your face here like

429
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:26,740
some sort of natty mustache and like you
very quickly but we will be able to have

430
00:34:26,739 --> 00:34:27,908
time in between them

431
00:34:27,909 --> 00:34:31,929
stretch out really quickly and then
relaxing really quickly

432
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,310
stretch out relax it and just feel what
it does

433
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:39,310
what does it feel like on the top of
your lip

434
00:34:46,179 --> 00:34:51,580
but when does it get warm when you guess
what when you stretch it what about when

435
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,899
you let me relax

436
00:34:52,899 --> 00:34:56,138
was that

437
00:34:56,139 --> 00:35:05,589
and when you relax it it gets cold and
bizarrely this effect is down to one

438
00:35:05,589 --> 00:35:12,160
want one of the most fundamental rules
of the universe and time

439
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:15,640
so who here has heard of entropy before

440
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:18,879
yeah yeah a few people to people

441
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:24,640
entropy is a quantity we like to define
in physics which is always increasing

442
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,868
inside an isolated system and that's a
very important bit of the rule entropy

443
00:35:31,869 --> 00:35:38,140
always increases inside an isolated
system an entry can be thought of as a

444
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,910
measure of disorder

445
00:35:39,910 --> 00:35:46,000
mom I actually almost like the number of
ways that you can do something so

446
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,810
there's gonna be a lot of people like
most people say are the entropy means

447
00:35:52,810 --> 00:35:56,140
that things just naturally get Messier

448
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:59,319
so for example I shouldn't need to clean
my room

449
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:05,170
he'll just get Messier any way to which
the fundamental flaw is your room is not

450
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:11,440
a closed system and so you can't use
that excuse them for exactly the same

451
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,460
reason

452
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:17,140
if you're creationist you can't say that
and she always increasing

453
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,290
it is it disproves evolution because it

454
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:23,740
evolution obviously things are getting
more order to come to the final time

455
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:28,149
audio coupe to the fine specimens we see
out here today and they say oh well

456
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:30,160
that's more they can't have happened

457
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:34,029
you've ignored half of the rule you
cannot ignore half of the rule that

458
00:36:34,030 --> 00:36:38,320
would be like me saying the rule is you
can drive at 70 miles per hour on a

459
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:43,060
motorway and then proceeding to drive
through the center of town at 70 miles

460
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:44,080
per hour

461
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:51,970
it doesn't work and and yes some people
still trying to use this as a result but

462
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:57,310
going to the elastic bands and basically
the reason it heats up is because we

463
00:36:57,310 --> 00:37:00,759
need entropy to always be increasing

464
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:04,210
so the first way that we've got entropy
inside elastic band is it's got lots of

465
00:37:04,210 --> 00:37:10,000
long fiber chains inside it and these
are all giggling about in space in lots

466
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,770
of different directions and when the
elastic band is small there wiggling

467
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:18,580
around the normal lot and basically
there's lots and lots of ways they can

468
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,890
wiggle and the elastic band be small

469
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:24,368
which means that in this state they have
high entropy

470
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:31,599
but when you put taught all of those
bands line up nicely and then there are

471
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,869
only a few ways you can do that so that
physical position has low entropy

472
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:42,849
but there's more than just how to change
chains can wiggle

473
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:48,220
there's also how they can jiggle because
none of these chains a stationary

474
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:55,480
they're all moving all the time and if
things are moving faster then again they

475
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:59,770
got what they have got many more ways in
which they can achieve this and so the

476
00:37:59,770 --> 00:38:02,830
moving faster means that you have a
higher entropy

477
00:38:03,550 --> 00:38:09,250
so when you stretch your elastic band
you all the entropy based on how the

478
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:13,900
chains are aligned goes down but it gets
warmer all the entry based on how

479
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,530
they're moving goes up and basically
when you're letting go

480
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:20,800
exactly the opposite is happening is
still ended up with a net increase in

481
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,640
entropy

482
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:27,609
but you have to put energy in so he eat
up your get kind of getting a pull out

483
00:38:27,609 --> 00:38:31,598
that collect elastic bands can pull
things they'd be giving the energy to

484
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:35,920
that and so they've got to lose energy
and cold cool down as well and so you've

485
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,310
got all of this going on but that
there's a blow it

486
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:44,049
no more there's also just how they're
losing heat to the outside world

487
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,609
this is my last equation so we can sure
you're glad

488
00:38:48,609 --> 00:38:54,460
and this is a really simple equation for
change in entropy now on this left-hand

489
00:38:54,460 --> 00:39:01,450
side we have D s as entropy and so TS is
a change in entropy and on the right

490
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:03,669
side are going to be on here

491
00:39:03,670 --> 00:39:08,440
that's nonsense I equation that is
actually a nonsense equation i do

492
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:12,730
apologize that that d on the bottom has
snuck in and shouldn't be there the

493
00:39:12,730 --> 00:39:18,070
bottom of that equation should just
safety so cause DQ is the amount of heat

494
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:22,630
flowing into a material that's positive
it's flowing out of material is negative

495
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:26,680
and tea which should be on its own on
the bottom and i'm going to have words

496
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,859
with that d later is the temperature of
that and so as you can see he goes in

497
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:37,960
the entropy increases he goes out the
entropy decreases but the amount by

498
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:42,010
which it does so is related to the
temperature of the body and this

499
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:46,330
basically explains why when you've got a
hot thing and a cold thing together

500
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:50,470
the hot thing gets cooler and the cool
thing gets hotter because

501
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:56,950
the heart of thing higher temperature
there measure of course in kelvin and

502
00:39:56,950 --> 00:40:00,520
the the color thing has a lower
temperature so for the same amount of

503
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,720
heat moving

504
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,209
there'll be a greater change in entropy
for the cold object so the heat moves

505
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:10,090
the color object overall entropy

506
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,390
well increase there's a bigger change
for the color object to say my feet

507
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:17,740
lower temperature so that's great

508
00:40:17,740 --> 00:40:22,839
and that explains kind of heat flowing
but the fridge doesn't really do that

509
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:27,640
it'd be kind of a rubbish fridge if it
did it in the fridge we've got a cold

510
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:32,859
area inside and he is removed from that
and dumped in the hotter area outside

511
00:40:33,820 --> 00:40:38,830
so how we always getting an increase in
entropy and this equation shows that as

512
00:40:38,830 --> 00:40:46,690
well because usually a fridge again is
not an isolated system

513
00:40:47,590 --> 00:40:52,930
it's plugged in and so we can get
something so when transferring heat we

514
00:40:52,930 --> 00:40:56,379
can create some extra heat basically by
using some of the electrical energy

515
00:40:56,380 --> 00:40:57,790
we're getting flowing in

516
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,470
so the energy goes it goes leaves from
the inside the fridge and the energy

517
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,319
that comes out the back of the fridge as
heat is not the same amount more energy

518
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:13,359
is coming out so we can put a bigger DQ
and we can overcome the higher

519
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,060
temperature of the outside and still
keep entropy increasing and this in fact

520
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:21,369
all the way around inside the fridge

521
00:41:21,369 --> 00:41:25,240
entry is always increasing you've got
you start off their inside afraid you

522
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:29,169
got cold fridge you got a cooler with
regimented now in the back

523
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:35,589
he flows from hot to cold increase in
entropy then you let that then you don't

524
00:41:35,589 --> 00:41:40,480
you let that go through a that i can get
it

525
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,980
excuse me then when you've done that you
your heat your your-your-your now

526
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:52,660
slightly warmer fluid goes on the back
and is compressed is getting compressed

527
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:57,279
into a smaller space which means there
are fewer ways all the particles inside

528
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,960
it can be arranged

529
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:03,460
and so that would not only be a low
engine be put to counter that it heats

530
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:07,839
up higher entropy is now at the back of
the fridge is now in the little wavy

531
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:10,210
been to the back but now because it's
got hotter

532
00:42:10,210 --> 00:42:13,510
it's hot on the outside it flows from
the hot to the cold

533
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:17,920
increase in entropy and finally it's
allowed to go through an expansion valve

534
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,430
and spread out it spread out more space
more ways of actually being able to have

535
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,379
the particles and arranged and higher
energy there and it cools down as it

536
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,660
does so and so all the way around

537
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,029
we've got this fundamental increase in
entropy and in as a physicist

538
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:44,320
that's really really weird is normally
in physics things people have any one

539
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:48,490
direction happen in your direction all
the laws of physics basically apartness

540
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:52,930
look the same depending on which way
round you look at the meantime this is

541
00:42:52,930 --> 00:42:57,700
the only one that seems to have a
direction and this is Labor lot of

542
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:02,020
people start pondering on whether this
it gives you the meaning of time at the

543
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,950
only problem there is basically what
you've got is physicists talking

544
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:09,339
philosophy which is never a good plan

545
00:43:10,599 --> 00:43:14,230
hello i am willing to do it with a few
points inside me if you see near the bar

546
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:19,839
later but when we've got one of these
weird lack of symmetry we should start

547
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:23,680
looking for more because they're
interesting places and one of the

548
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,009
perfect place we get them is in matter
and antimatter perhaps because inside

549
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,310
when we have energy of the vacuum i was
talking about earlier

550
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:38,680
sometimes that can spontaneously cause
some matter to be created and when you

551
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,890
get a particle and antiparticle at the
same time

552
00:43:42,430 --> 00:43:44,770
normally these their meat and I late

553
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:50,350
done that's fine we not changed anything
but we expect the Big Bang equal amounts

554
00:43:50,350 --> 00:43:56,380
of this matter and antimatter to have
been created but you look around and

555
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:58,540
we're all made up out of matter

556
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:02,050
you can tell because we not basically
exploded when we come into contact with

557
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:03,190
anything else

558
00:44:03,190 --> 00:44:08,860
and so like we got this weird difference
between matter and antimatter and this

559
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,180
again is a current research project
partially at CERN we're just trying to

560
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,830
work out where it is

561
00:44:14,830 --> 00:44:20,080
there's a difference between matter and
antimatter that actually allows anything

562
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:23,080
to exist at all

563
00:44:24,250 --> 00:44:29,770
so we've gone through an awful lot of
physics

564
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:34,390
we picked up quantum physics we picked
up general relativity and we picked up

565
00:44:34,390 --> 00:44:39,520
the contact concept of HP and these are
all kind of like always the fundamentals

566
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:43,780
of what we've got to work with and so
we're finally ready to go to a grand

567
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:44,620
finale

568
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:51,580
how is the universe like a light bulb
and I kind of jumped over a bit earlier

569
00:44:51,580 --> 00:44:56,080
where I was talking about lights coming
from stars because I said you get a

570
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:57,610
whole different colors

571
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:02,440
loads of different colors of light and I
didn't really explain how that happened

572
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:06,460
how we had the entire spectrum before it
was absorbed by the gases surrounding it

573
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:12,730
and so the reason I didn't say that is
actually in some ways it's quite

574
00:45:12,730 --> 00:45:18,760
complicated but it wasn't that way we
look at the light coming out from the

575
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:23,950
stars and we look at the ideas of
entropy and likelihood of various things

576
00:45:23,950 --> 00:45:26,049
and with the entropy

577
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:29,620
we have said things go too high energy
things go to more disordered well as

578
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:34,660
more different ways of doing it and with
light as you get into the high-energy

579
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:39,970
light the high-frequency UV rays and so
on

580
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:46,049
then there should be more ways for that
we happen in caused by the jiggling

581
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:51,540
around of all of the plasma inside the
Sun but and so in that case we should

582
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:53,490
expect to see a lot more of it

583
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:58,500
we should expect basically to have the
entire planet irradiated by UV rays and

584
00:45:58,500 --> 00:46:00,420
none of us existing at all

585
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,010
bizarrely it's the fact that this
doesn't happen that physicists have

586
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:08,010
called the ultraviolet catastrophe

587
00:46:08,730 --> 00:46:16,020
yes yes I'm physicist again bit poor at
naming things often and basically we

588
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,869
didn't know why it was this didn't
happen until a max planck basically

589
00:46:21,869 --> 00:46:29,940
looked at the shape of the emission this
is an example of the sort of shape that

590
00:46:29,940 --> 00:46:35,099
we get from the the emission spectra of
stars and saying well and the

591
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:39,839
high-frequency why do we get this taylor
and he basically said let's go back to

592
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,130
quantum physics

593
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,190
it was a back to it basically was a new
thing around then he was kind of just

594
00:46:44,190 --> 00:46:48,809
making it up and said well let's assume
that there's a possibility of getting

595
00:46:48,809 --> 00:46:55,140
things which goes down as the energy
quanta involved gets bigger and more

596
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:59,009
people said to him why that why would
you do that

597
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:06,930
and he didn't know but it worked and
then allegedly they normally I teach

598
00:47:06,930 --> 00:47:09,359
physics sometimes an end to my students

599
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,930
I'm always very keen that they write out
there working in their explanations

600
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:18,000
I wouldn't have accepted it just works
normally the only reason we were it was

601
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,170
really accepted by then is because it
gave us grass like this this is some

602
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:27,930
experimental data and basically the
error that the line that's going through

603
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:33,660
all of these points does it so well that
that the predicted line which is from

604
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:38,460
his theory goes with it so well that we
basically can't distinguish between the

605
00:47:38,460 --> 00:47:39,530
two

606
00:47:39,530 --> 00:47:43,790
and so this was brilliant and men that
we actually were getting somewhere

607
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,890
but still is kind of unsatisfactory

608
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,530
so it took a little while of quantum
physics actually coming in before this

609
00:47:54,530 --> 00:47:56,570
was kind of accepted

610
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:59,090
we talk about all the different energy
levels and this kind of basically

611
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:07,490
eventually all worked but this data
isn't from a son

612
00:48:07,490 --> 00:48:13,279
our star this data is in fact something
which is very similar to that which was

613
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:18,560
developed and discovered by arno penzias
and robert wilson in 1964

614
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:24,950
they built basically a radio telescope
and wanted to take lots of measurements

615
00:48:24,950 --> 00:48:25,730
with it

616
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:29,900
they were good physicist say they cool
down the senses so that things weren't

617
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,320
talking about in there so much said it
had less noise inside it

618
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,040
but no matter what they did they got
some constant noise and they did

619
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,370
everything they could think of their
appointed the antenna all in different

620
00:48:43,370 --> 00:48:45,770
places they still got this noise

621
00:48:45,770 --> 00:48:49,820
they tried doing get join a day by doing
a night same noise

622
00:48:49,820 --> 00:48:55,160
they tried doing get or different times
and unlike many experiments they had to

623
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,710
clean out what was referred to as
dielectric material which have been left

624
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:04,850
in the Horn of that their antennae
because some pigeons have been using

625
00:49:04,850 --> 00:49:14,569
inside it and they clean it all out and
they still got some noise and they

626
00:49:14,570 --> 00:49:20,030
couldn't work out where it was and then
this is where we see how the world of

627
00:49:20,030 --> 00:49:23,870
real physics is very different from
school because basically what they did

628
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:30,830
is a phone . their colleagues nearby and
said we don't know we've got a signal

629
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:33,710
we need to get rid of it so we can do
our experiment do you know what it is

630
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:38,960
and then going contact with contact with
some physicists and nearby lab

631
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,970
who were very very disappointed in order
to get this phone call because their

632
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:54,689
reaction was I think we can we know
precisely what this is this is the

633
00:49:54,690 --> 00:49:57,510
remains of the Big Bang

634
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:01,080
this is like that has been bouncing
around since basically shortly after the

635
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,650
Big Bang and as universe is cooled

636
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:11,609
it's shifted and basically this is a
spectrum for the University of a few

637
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:18,000
Kelvin a few degrees above absolute zero
and that is what this particular one is

638
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:24,150
it's exactly the same shape as you get
form stars and also from things like

639
00:50:24,150 --> 00:50:30,330
eight filament light bulb but when they
were doing this

640
00:50:30,330 --> 00:50:34,080
yes

641
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:41,700
so this was an amazing results and they
want a lens is on wilson won the nobel

642
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,890
prize for this which i think is
brilliant not only because it's an

643
00:50:46,890 --> 00:50:48,150
amazing discovery

644
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,230
but what they won the nobel prize for is
basically being business who did

645
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,630
everything right

646
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:57,630
they try to remove all the sources of
error in the measurement

647
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:03,150
they went through it nice and
systematically and then they asked for

648
00:51:03,150 --> 00:51:05,640
help and then they finally found
something

649
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:10,710
a very with someone else and come up
with independently which matched and so

650
00:51:10,710 --> 00:51:15,300
I'm i think this is a wonderful place
was to be at but it's not the whole

651
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:18,359
story because this isn't actually their
original results

652
00:51:18,359 --> 00:51:23,940
this is some later measurements taken by
NASA and in fact if you

653
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:28,320
oh one of those things like their color
ways of thinking about this but based on

654
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,010
the shape is the same for black bodies
but the position of the peak changes

655
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:36,090
depending on temperature so one way you
can think about this is is this

656
00:51:36,090 --> 00:51:39,600
temperature because universe was
originally very very hot and has cooled

657
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:44,339
down since but another way of thinking
about it is going back to our formula 1

658
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:48,420
cars and our definitions from different
distant stars you can think of this as a

659
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:52,049
light originally basically being having
a lot

660
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:59,369
smaller wavelength and gradually being
stretched out as time has gone on and

661
00:51:59,369 --> 00:52:06,150
moving towards left hand side of the
graph and so we're now a point where

662
00:52:06,150 --> 00:52:07,949
we've seen the universe

663
00:52:07,949 --> 00:52:12,029
you see how it's like a light bulb but
no matter how good with some results are

664
00:52:12,029 --> 00:52:14,519
as soon as you start looking deeper

665
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:19,678
you're likely to find something else and
this is w map project

666
00:52:20,369 --> 00:52:24,179
this is looking basically at the sky and
looking in all distant different

667
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:29,429
directions and these colors are
basically slight differences in the

668
00:52:29,429 --> 00:52:34,109
temperature that we get from that nice
grab in different but when we look in

669
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:36,029
different directions

670
00:52:36,029 --> 00:52:40,199
obviously red and yellow is hotter than
green and blue is colder and these are

671
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:47,939
all on the order of 1000 of a calvin
1000 of a degree temperature difference

672
00:52:47,939 --> 00:52:52,259
which is quite a bit when you're looking
at just kind of 2.7 Calvin to start with

673
00:52:52,259 --> 00:52:56,789
and this is where we are now and we're
wondering whether or not this is kind of

674
00:52:56,789 --> 00:53:02,880
an imprint of fluctuations in the early
universe which basically meant there was

675
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:07,019
actually a way for things to start
coalescing rather than being forever a

676
00:53:07,019 --> 00:53:12,419
diffuse equal throughout the entire
universe just set of matter things to

677
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:19,140
start coalescing and forming stars and
galaxies and planets and eventually all

678
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:26,279
of the processes that led to people and
the modern world today so I i hope you

679
00:53:26,279 --> 00:53:26,939
enjoyed this

680
00:53:26,939 --> 00:53:30,509
I hope you feel like we've come a long
way and we started from things that you

681
00:53:30,509 --> 00:53:31,650
are used to

682
00:53:31,650 --> 00:53:36,719
and I hope you enjoy the rest of EMF
camp one thing that I need to pop my

683
00:53:36,719 --> 00:53:40,769
hand is all of the wonderful people who
made all of the figures and images i

684
00:53:40,769 --> 00:53:42,209
used throughout this slide

685
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:45,239
attribution is very important especially
when you see science images on the

686
00:53:45,239 --> 00:53:50,400
internet please make sure that
attributed to who made them but so just

687
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,179
two questions to evaluate do your thing
you've learned something

688
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:58,949
yes excellent and have you enjoy doing
so

689
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:04,150
as well thank you very much after we can
call this experiment and accept success

690
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:05,650
thank you very much and enjoy the best
your cam
