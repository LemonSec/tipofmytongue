1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,580
right

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,530
hi my name is James I

3
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,570
I'm from

4
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,160
our cat vines creativity affinity
technical whiz kid hurry

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,830
basically we do cool creative stuff with
technology but the affinity bit means

6
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:30,418
related brands related to people so it's
all related to a greater strategical

7
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:35,340
purpose but i'm here today to talk to
you very briefly about EEG

8
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,769
so I'm going to give you a really top
line overview of what is out works i'm

9
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:44,129
going to show you some cool examples of
what people have done with it

10
00:00:44,129 --> 00:00:47,940
what my company done with it and then
i'll give you a quick demo if we have

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,989
time / if everything is charged so yeah
go for it so EG is electro and said

12
00:00:54,989 --> 00:00:55,829
follow

13
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:01,230
graphy basically it's a method that's
used to track brain activity by putting

14
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,718
electrodes on your head

15
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,160
specifically how it works is your brain
has loads of yours in it and you always

16
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:13,560
communicate but with each other by axons
and dendrites so the orange cable

17
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,220
it's going between those two new orleans
is an axon

18
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,039
that's a communicator and the little
orange bits on the edges of the neuron

19
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,650
are the dendrites they receive

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:30,540
so essentially neurons communicate to
other neurons by sending a voltage

21
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,060
between each other when that essentially
happens is a polarity shift in the two

22
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:44,490
cells that is what the sensor picks up
and reads so it's normal use is for

23
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,679
understanding application cheezer's or
hunting migraines or behavior

24
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,930
abnormalities or brain death

25
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,720
predicting comas or another use of it is
for research

26
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:03,060
so in your science people study the
nervous system or in marketing my old

27
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:08,880
company actually use deg as a way to
detect if people actually focused on

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,980
advert that they just made which is
quite a cool use of it but i think the

29
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,790
really cool uses when people like ask a
little bit and they have stuff together

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:21,209
so this guy he bought a little toy

31
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:31,360
a EEG headset and he 3d printer by hand
and he made this really cool thing I let

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:32,650
the video play

33
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:40,120
I'm really prepared for this

34
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:52,390
ok

35
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:00,790
yes chef tell was 14 when he first
started taking apart toasters five years

36
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:01,179
on

37
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:05,799
he's being touted as a global leader in
robotics for his range of low-cost and

38
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:09,040
remote robotic hands developed in his
bedroom

39
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,159
some can be controlled by users mind

40
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,450
I'm a good example is rigid an amputee
use the wireless brain with headset to

41
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:20,768
control a hand and he was able to
completely control the robotic and about

42
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:25,989
10 minutes so the learning curve is
hardly a learning curve anymore

43
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:31,359
- appel taught himself how to design
Mike and code his creations using a

44
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:35,019
device that picks up on electrical
impulses coming from the brain

45
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:39,459
he can manipulate his robotic hands
fingers we actually track patterns and

46
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:42,310
you try to convert that into movement

47
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,090
I'm so with this I'm actually able to
change groups based our group patterns

48
00:03:46,090 --> 00:03:50,410
based on our faithful jesters and then
use the raw arm actual brain waves and

49
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:56,230
focus to actually close the hand or open
the clamp over hand / appelles robotics

50
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:00,548
aren't the first to be controlled by
brainwave frequencies scientist in

51
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:04,359
Austria visit the truck driver with
something similar in 2010

52
00:04:04,359 --> 00:04:08,799
but that's not where the magic happens
3d printing allows you to create

53
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,639
something that's human like something
that's extremely customized again for a

54
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:16,000
very low cost which for certain
applications such as prosthetics

55
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,310
there's a pretty big part of it

56
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,840
the hands cost as little as six hundred
dollars to make sure pal want others to

57
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,650
use his work as a platform to create
customized versions for themselves

58
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,660
he's made his software open source that
could eventually mean robots being sent

59
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,680
in to control the search-and-rescue
missions as well as improving the lives

60
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,860
of amputees globally

61
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:45,430
cool so that's basically just an
entry-level tool that he was using to

62
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:47,230
pick up those EG waves

63
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:51,340
this next one uses a slightly more
advanced to EEG headset

64
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:54,489
I won't at the whole video player just
basically just sum it up

65
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,310
I'm but basically what's happening is
they're tracking different different

66
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:07,360
ranges of brainwaves and so as the fires
alpha beta theater Delta there's another

67
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,250
one but basically there to do the
frequency of of the how often the brain

68
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,080
waves move

69
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,680
so essentially as there's a five rabbits
the five different brain patterns and

70
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,700
when one is more active and another it
will activate those circles their

71
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:25,479
speakers so activate the speaker so
sounds will play

72
00:05:25,479 --> 00:05:28,479
so it's quite a call Artie peace

73
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:45,550
supposed to

74
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:52,360
yeah

75
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,440
we did it

76
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,389
so you get a good understanding of that

77
00:06:08,389 --> 00:06:14,000
so this one was done by BBC

78
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:19,639
they took the EEG headset and they
allows use of basis of a basic methods

79
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,419
to control

80
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:24,919
I player so people who struggle to use
remote controlled or probably no

81
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,299
problems too

82
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:30,080
ack access their teeth if they're just
sittin down they can just put on his

83
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,060
headset and they can just think and you
by focusing or relaxing depend on how

84
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:42,530
you set it so either you have to focus
so writes it on the left basically you

85
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:46,130
can see it's moving up and down that's
your focus level and then you basically

86
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:52,250
relax your mind and then selects the
show you want to watch it and we've

87
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:59,330
effectively we get so this is still in
our in the am what I don't think this is

88
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:02,930
like we have here this is the
combinations that are on the wedding

89
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:06,169
coming allowing him to

90
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:13,789
so finally what we did with its this is
my company and we made a mind-controlled

91
00:07:13,789 --> 00:07:15,919
car for money supermarket

92
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:22,190
the campaign was about smarter driving
so i don't know how many of you know but

93
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:26,870
car insurers are going to be putting a
little black boxes in your car in the

94
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:31,639
future and these boxes can easily track
where you're going how fast you're going

95
00:07:31,639 --> 00:07:36,740
how how you're driving basically and
they basically determine your premium

96
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:42,139
rates based on on that information so
they want to market it in a positive way

97
00:07:42,139 --> 00:07:49,010
and so this whole idea of rewarding
smarter drivers came about and they want

98
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:53,360
to join really cool innovative and tacky
so we proposed making a mind control car

99
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,360
that all the best drivers got a chance
to use so

100
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,980
I'll just play the video

101
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:05,610
this is our web

102
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,820
hmm

103
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:22,920
this is a unique UK first driving
experience where we give people the

104
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:28,530
opportunity to drive a real car live
around the track just using their minds

105
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:34,470
we've got a high advantage to EEG
headset that has 16 cents adds that can

106
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,030
measure brain activity

107
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:41,130
we then have a software that can take
that different brain activity and sign

108
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:45,570
it's a certain function our software
then programmed to send a radio

109
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:48,840
frequency signal to a robot inside of
the car

110
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:51,870
telling the wheel and pressing on the
accelerator and the brake

111
00:08:51,870 --> 00:09:00,390
I now going to demonstrate this working
so i'm not going to think left as you

112
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,030
can see the wheels turned left

113
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,030
I'm not going to think right

114
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:13,160
cause now turning right I'm involved
with many supermarkets and the car

115
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:18,709
insurance and Alec I drive this is all
about reminding drivers really about the

116
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:23,630
power of thought of and about using
their heads with driving obviously be

117
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:25,010
safe behind the wheel

118
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:29,660
use your brain at all times this is all
about using the power of thought and all

119
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,260
of my life I've been a strong advocate
of using your brain as much as you

120
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,250
possibly can

121
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:39,380
this really is the ultimate test drive
full that brains of Britain

122
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,439
we're going to have people controlling
cars with their minds

123
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,950
this is epic

124
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,610
so yeah that was really epic

125
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:59,300
I'm so yeah that was last year and that
was Carol Vorderman on

126
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,469
she was actually quite good at it but
are ya

127
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,420
she didn't like it very much and I'm
species but I was only taught how to use

128
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:08,900
them

129
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:14,209
I had to put this device on her head and
yeah she wasn't a big family to ask her

130
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:17,150
to remove her metal hair extensions
because they're interfering with the

131
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:17,810
signal

132
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:25,040
so yeah i'm yeah i don't have much time
you have left because i know we started

133
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
late right ok

134
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:32,089
a little bit of time okay right I'm
going to try and give a quick demo now

135
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:35,210
of course everything is going to work

136
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:49,600
so I'll just walk you through roughly
how things work for the mind control car

137
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,940
and this is sort of a similar ish demo
to that in the sense that i'm basically

138
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,800
what I had to do was you

139
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,199
right so you put aside to honor the
calibrated which are going to see me

140
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:03,250
doing in a minute

141
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:06,640
and once it's got to them

142
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,319
God right everything's going wrong with
this talk I'm right

143
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:15,610
depend on how well my computer behaves
out what might do I might just do that

144
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:19,480
the demo afterwards if it's going to be
difficult but basically the way this

145
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:23,290
works is you have to train the software

146
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,490
what understand what a left signal means
or what the rights of all means to you

147
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:33,820
so what it does is armed I say to you
think left and you then in your head you

148
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:39,250
then think left whatever that is to you
and I then press the record button in

149
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,020
the software records

150
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:46,150
what those patterns of electrical
signals happening your brain equal left

151
00:11:46,150 --> 00:11:48,730
and then i do the same for right

152
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:52,570
I do the same for forward and so then
what you've got is a patterns the this

153
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:57,310
soft waiting recognize the patterns it
then once it to text left right forward

154
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:01,930
and then sends a radio frequency signal
to a robot inside of the car which then

155
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:07,839
controls the steering wheel and controls
the accelerated this later in the break

156
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,430
well it's working

157
00:12:12,430 --> 00:12:15,109
that's it I'm sorry

158
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:18,260
eyes because normally when i put this
headset on these those green bits there

159
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:22,459
means that every month every note on my
head is basically connected and is

160
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:24,439
getting a signal from my brain

161
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:29,029
I've never had it that is put on my head
and it's just his work - great ok

162
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,750
I deal right

163
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:45,350
ok so when we actually built it for my
supermarket

164
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:50,300
this is this is the example software so
we didn't code this this is the sample

165
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,189
software that comes from a motive but we
use the sdk that came with this

166
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:59,360
basically to build the similar
functionality you about see into

167
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,350
essentially our app which then worked
the radio frequency controllers in the

168
00:13:03,350 --> 00:13:06,769
mobile and so on the right

169
00:13:06,769 --> 00:13:14,570
i'm going to add some actions here that
I can train

170
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:18,380
ok so far

171
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:24,680
great neutral state so he understands
what my car is ready for it starts from

172
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:29,420
mutual then from there if i have any
active thought and then record them so

173
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:33,530
it's gonna have like a neutral starting
point so I'm going to tell it I'm gonna

174
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:37,970
tell us offer what my neutral is so it
can then learn other actions from there

175
00:13:37,970 --> 00:13:49,100
so cool

176
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:56,930
so it's not accepted my neutral so now
i'm going to train it to understand what

177
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:59,719
left means we'll go from there

178
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:06,200
so I'm going to go cheat this to make a
bit faster so normally with this kind of

179
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,950
thing you have to trade it for hours to
understand what left is because it to

180
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,150
pick up the signal

181
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:15,620
it's not as simple as thinking the word
left and then suddenly it just works

182
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:19,880
it's much stronger when it comes to
understanding muscle movements

183
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:24,830
so if I was to clench my fist because as
a signal and strong so let me go to my

184
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,580
arm

185
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,240
if they see pics that much clearer
equally it's also really good at picking

186
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,650
up facial expressions

187
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:34,340
so I think we're going to make this a
bit quicker i'll just put a silly face

188
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:38,630
and then and it will pick them up with
that said let's have a strong signal for

189
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,660
the senses to understand so hopefully it
will speed the process up

190
00:14:53,110 --> 00:15:04,779
ok so Charlie left school left go left

191
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:16,690
do it come on let's try again try again
so that bc and record it and record it

192
00:15:18,730 --> 00:15:22,720
cool

193
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:28,450
this is a long video as well great and
her catching my finest

194
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:32,410
ok so usual

195
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:45,220
well beyond my control her and ok cool
how much time we got left

196
00:15:45,220 --> 00:15:50,170
so five minutes I think so yes close a
cake already

197
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,310
listen that's actually end of the talk
but yeah i'm i'm gonna stick around

198
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:58,839
longer after this off the stage and the
person set up an almost have a go put it

199
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:03,130
on or ask me questions feel free to grab
me and I'm yeah hope you enjoyed the

200
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:05,800
talk

201
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:06,040
look
