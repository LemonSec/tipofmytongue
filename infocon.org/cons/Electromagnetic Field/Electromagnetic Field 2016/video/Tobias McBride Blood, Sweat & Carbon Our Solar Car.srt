1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,110
okay we're gonna make start now

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:16,480
so we have time with

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,539
to talk about blood sweat and tears and
electric some with solar cars so without

4
00:00:22,539 --> 00:00:25,270
further ado I will hand over to him

5
00:00:25,270 --> 00:00:28,840
thank you very much indeed a good
afternoon everyone thanks very much for

6
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,850
joining me and being here today it's a
lovely day and great to be here at two

7
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:37,900
what I to Glastonbury for geeks and
guilford fantastic festival have been

8
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:41,589
running around for most of the day and
look at some of the stands is and

9
00:00:41,589 --> 00:00:44,890
workshops it's been great to be here so
I'm giving a talk actually its blood

10
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:47,050
sweat and carbon and not blood sweat and
tears

11
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:52,360
this was a phrase coined in australia by
the team and its really going to give

12
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,609
you this presentation is kind of give
you an overview of how we actually

13
00:00:54,609 --> 00:01:00,520
designed we built and raced this so the
car is pretty incredible feat where all

14
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,239
students at Durham University including
myself are moving into my third year now

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,990
we've got a very exciting time ahead so
I'm going to give you a glimpse into our

16
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:12,610
past and a very exciting future ahead so
let's begin

17
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,539
so we are a student LED and student-run
team as I said and we're mixture of

18
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,740
undergrad and postgrad all doing this in
our free time so we're mixture of

19
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:29,348
anything from engineers normally to
business students marketers and it think

20
00:01:29,349 --> 00:01:33,940
of any type of degree and we have one
and as a variety of degrees and its

21
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:37,270
entirety extracurricular so although
University you will think you're going

22
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:38,289
down the pub for a drink

23
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:42,369
no we are actually doing this in our
free time so we have a favorite of free

24
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:44,679
time at University and we and we like to
do this

25
00:01:44,679 --> 00:01:49,929
what about the team history well we
actually are the longest running a team

26
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:56,950
to do this we are found in 2002 and we
built our first so the car in 2004

27
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:00,789
now a lot of you probably want to see me
so the car before met some of you may

28
00:02:00,789 --> 00:02:03,250
have and i'll show you a picture 1 in
the second

29
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:06,580
it's a very unique design it's a
basically a table with solar panels on

30
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,060
as well people often say to us why is
there a table at a motor show why is

31
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:12,700
their table here today with solar panels
on

32
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:16,390
it's a very unique design and we built
our first one in 2004

33
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:22,569
so quite a while ago now we then took
this car and we raced it across America

34
00:02:22,569 --> 00:02:25,689
now this is a race called Nazca North
American so the challenge

35
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,700
and we race this is two and a half
thousand miles so it's not like a test

36
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:34,208
track where you raise and she's got the
fastest time of star and the reason we

37
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:36,010
price over the car roll or something

38
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:41,109
what it is is a two and a half thousand
mile race all the way across America and

39
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:45,190
we actually won what's known as the best
rookie team award which we which we

40
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,320
liked in 2011

41
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:51,310
we took this car and enhanced a great
deal we put a lot of new refinements

42
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,550
into it and we raced across Australia
this time

43
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,790
so another big challenge this was 3,000
kilometers

44
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:03,880
so no mean feat 1,800 miles in in that
form and actually we were known as

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,209
durham university solar car now merged
with the formula soon team many of you

46
00:03:07,209 --> 00:03:10,630
will perform in a student of course our
primary focus going forward is on

47
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:16,810
so the cars but we do it for me to shoot
attribute to the team as well so this is

48
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:21,489
the car itself in 2008 pretty unique
looking if there's any Americans won't

49
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:24,280
show anyone knows the jetsons that's
what we kind of like to think it looks

50
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,640
like very futuristic very different
indeed

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,480
and that's it driving along normal
highways everyday roads really really

52
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,500
cool and a big challenge for us so we're
driving at highway speeds

53
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,760
here's some more shots of it by asking
some testing before the race actually

54
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,679
began and we also have again and a shot
of us on the road so this car could do

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,620
about 50 miles an hour or so pretty fast

56
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:53,019
I had three wheels as you can see their
steel stop frame chassis with a carbon

57
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:54,160
fiber top

58
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,829
now here's the actual pic garage at the
event you can actually see us we are

59
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:02,470
next to that big white trailer we
haven't got a big white trailer at the

60
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,310
time but we had humble beginnings and
that was us there with a low loader in a

61
00:04:06,310 --> 00:04:08,500
van so we still did very well

62
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:11,860
the best rookie team so they're a great
award for us to win

63
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:18,160
and still to 9,000 miles a big distance
now we took this car and we enhanced it

64
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,329
we made it longer

65
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,320
we made it lighter this is us with a 6
square meter array driving across

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,840
australia with infamous canopy bouncing
along

67
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,869
that's the ventilation i should point
out i obviously it clearly it is and

68
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,710
this is us on the just coming on the
shoot highway which is the main road

69
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:37,419
that runs from darwin in the north

70
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:41,320
all the way down to Adelaide so that's
1,800 miles it's a big distance and

71
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,030
that's actually finishing in a blade

72
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,200
so that's the car again similar design
to the one previously with a few

73
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,039
upgrades

74
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:52,420
now most you think what's happened here
is this car falling over know what we've

75
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:56,920
actually done is tilted on its side so
we raised from nine to five to eight to

76
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,150
five during the during the day and in
the morning and in the end the evening

77
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:04,120
we have an hour to charge up the
batteries and that's what we do he

78
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,350
pointed at the Sun and we managed to
collect the last bit of charge for our

79
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:13,150
batteries to drive the next day and
again there's another others they're

80
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:18,400
just going across the tropics and that's
in the pit lane and about 40 teams do

81
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,120
this so it's not like it's a small event
there's millions of dollars invested in

82
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:25,270
this and I'll go into that later on

83
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:29,080
now what's the point in all of this you
may be thinking what's the point in

84
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:33,729
designing building racing a car that
works in the sunshine but you think why

85
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,140
the developing in durham

86
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,530
I mean Durham's freezing cold and wet
that's a bit ironic isn't it

87
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:42,549
well we've got a very exciting future
ahead and we have three key arms to this

88
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,340
was showcasing the latest technology

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,090
it's all about proving to the public is
proving to ourselves that this

90
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,520
technology can work in any conditions

91
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:55,719
it's educating the public it's saying to
the public look what solar power can do

92
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,600
we can drive infinitely as long as the
sun shining

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,950
we are driving and it's also inspiring
the next generation because we do a lot

94
00:06:02,950 --> 00:06:06,099
of outreach to schools will take this
schools across the UK when we go to

95
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:10,510
major events and say become engineers
think differently as to how to build

96
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:12,789
things and think differently about our
planet

97
00:06:12,790 --> 00:06:16,240
now i'm going to walk you through our
brand new car

98
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:20,470
our new car well it's unlike anything
we've ever done before and had to move

99
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:23,500
to a four wheel design and we thought we
could just add a fourth wheel to the

100
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,430
existing one

101
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,600
that's fine actually now see me I've got
some lights brilliant home

102
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:32,590
we could have done that but we thought
we'll start from scratch so for three

103
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,539
years of design and development

104
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:40,210
we built this car this car has a four
wheel design six square meter array and

105
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:42,310
is unlike anything we've ever done
before

106
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:46,150
now this car itself we thought well
we're going to make it better obviously

107
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:50,469
because we're doing well we qualified in
the top 10 in 2011 had some technical

108
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:54,070
issues but we did well we can do better
though we can do better with a plucky

109
00:06:54,070 --> 00:06:55,120
British spirit

110
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,400
so we can do forty percent faster top
speed than our existing car at 70 miles

111
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,210
an hour

112
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:06,820
70 miles an hour in a car that is 5
meters long and 2 meters wide and weighs

113
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:10,420
a third of the way to the previous car
as 200 kilograms

114
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:14,710
it's an unbelievable feat of engineering
and a true triumph for our team

115
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,460
so actually build on how to actually do
it

116
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,979
what does it take to walk you through
four key areas first one is aerodynamics

117
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:27,340
we've got to make a car that streamlined
to make sure it cuts through the air

118
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,200
that most in the most efficient manner

119
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,979
we're going to make a car that's very
sound structurally it's very light and

120
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:38,380
strong and that's why carbon fiber comes
in the electronics are key part we can

121
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,100
build a car that's very aerodynamic we
can build a car that has a very good

122
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:45,220
structure but we've got something that
goes as fast as a milk flow

123
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:48,970
we've gone backwards so we need the best
power output with the most efficiency

124
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,680
and that's where the electronics comes
in and finally we need the business side

125
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,370
of things

126
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:57,520
we are entirely student-run and led we
are financed through sponsors and

127
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:01,419
private donors and we have actually
pretty the one the lower budgets have

128
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:05,740
any of the teams out there as an example
our budget for this coming year is about

129
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:10,150
a hundred thousand Michigan have four
million dollars a team in the

130
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:14,950
netherlands i believe it is has 28
million dollars so we are the plucky

131
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,130
Brit doing this in a shared in our free
time but we do very well

132
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:21,909
so let's walk through this the first
things aerodynamics this is a CFD model

133
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,640
of our car as I said it spent three
years in the design and development

134
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:29,050
stage and it's a truly groundbreaking
design an asymmetric design

135
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,500
now when you add a fourth wheel that's
fine when we put the driver what we

136
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,520
could put them in the middle

137
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:37,179
makes sense but actually had aerodynamic
drag you add weight because we're going

138
00:08:37,179 --> 00:08:40,150
to make the center of the car stronger
we have no God no longer go to throw

139
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:45,040
third wheel in line so we moved into the
left hand side in between the wheels

140
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,250
why is the left hand side on the
right-hand side when Australia drives on

141
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,120
that side

142
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,600
what is actually to cast the least
shadow on the solar panels

143
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,750
we're driving for hours in the morning
five hours in the afternoon

144
00:08:55,750 --> 00:09:00,520
evening time and with that content with
those conditions we cast the shadow by

145
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:05,439
putting the canopy on the left hand side
as i said we sit between the front and

146
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,130
rear rules

147
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:09,790
we r rear wheels and we've also got some
innovative suspension double wishbone at

148
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:13,810
the front and a trading arm rear
suspension at the rear to make sure it's

149
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,079
incredibly light we're actually moving
to carbon fiber suspension as part of

150
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,100
the upgrades this year

151
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:23,440
so really exciting time for us the area
of the car that actually hits the the

152
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:27,760
air itself is less than the square meter
less than a square meter that is

153
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,540
unbelievable for a car of this size to
make it strong and light is very

154
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:37,270
difficult and now i'm coming onto the
kind of the structure of the car now

155
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:41,439
we've got a big team at Durham who are
now pretty much experts in the area as

156
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,020
to how to build a car from scratch out
of carbon fiber

157
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:47,380
this has never been done before by us to
build the entire car we've done bits and

158
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:47,920
pieces

159
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,729
you know I've meter squared let's say
we've never built a car that's 5 by 2

160
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,750
meters

161
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,010
how to actually do this well i should
also point out that we use five times

162
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:01,300
this power than the price when we're
cruising how to actually manage this

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,630
well let's go through and look at it the
first will create molds this is a cnc

164
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:05,610
router

165
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,630
cutting the mold out of model board in
order for us to make the complex shapes

166
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:14,700
needed to construct the car so we form
layers of these we build them up and

167
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,570
this is part of the process at southwest
durham just me around down the road from

168
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:21,240
us they gave us this machine said you
can have a machine

169
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:25,410
one problem is broken so you need to fix
it and then build the car so we actually

170
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:29,459
fix the Machine and build the car from
scratch one of the only teams to do this

171
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,869
most teams just say oh Ford you're now
down the road from us Michigan filled

172
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,310
the car for us thanks very much

173
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:38,550
so we built the car entirely from
scratch and this is what we ended up

174
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:43,349
with for the molds so we then created an
oven in order to heat the carbon fiber

175
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:47,279
up and get the epoxy to set when we put
the carbon fiber in but when you

176
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,399
obviously build carbon fiber you've got
to make sure it seals and and is

177
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,480
correctly formed and to do that you got
to create a vacuum and create a vacuum

178
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:55,740
need a bag this size

179
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,100
what about the length of this room big
lecture theatre we got there at the room

180
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:04,019
oh sorry it's a pretty big letters we
got a Durham and that cover all of it

181
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:08,100
so if there's one tear in the bag we've
had it we've got to make sure that the

182
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,600
seal is optimal across the entire range
and that's a key part of our layup and

183
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,070
building of the structure

184
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,430
it's a really interesting part of us
again we've never done this before and

185
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:20,790
yet we created a car that is very
lightweight and very strong

186
00:11:21,329 --> 00:11:26,219
moreover when we move look at the
structural side we also think about

187
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,690
safety for the driver

188
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:32,430
the rules are excuse me the rules are
very specific and they say you gotta

189
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:33,930
survive a certain impact

190
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:37,380
so actually reinforce the side of the
car and the front of the car with kevlar

191
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:41,459
that means that we've got great shatter
resistant so when in god forbid if we

192
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:45,119
did have an accident the graph carbon
fiber doesn't shatter incredible

193
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,800
innovation there that we came about with
so that's the structural side that's the

194
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,729
mechanical side

195
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:53,730
what about the electric side about the
power tronix of the car again we need

196
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:58,110
this to go fast but on very little power
so

197
00:11:58,899 --> 00:12:02,019
we've got a really innovative new motor
that we've designed and built from the

198
00:12:02,019 --> 00:12:02,920
ground up

199
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,920
we're moving onto I think our fifth
generation motor the next time that we

200
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,920
go to Australia and it's an in wheel
motor

201
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,099
it's inside the hub of the most of the
wheel there's no separate gearbox

202
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:16,509
drivetrain chains anything inside the
motor itself and that means we got

203
00:12:16,509 --> 00:12:22,179
incredible efficiency and we've got
incredible top speed as well as i said

204
00:12:22,179 --> 00:12:25,329
we will have now got a second generation
of this particular form of in her motor

205
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:30,638
overall it's all our fifth one that
we're building and we designed this

206
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:34,059
ourselves and built it ourselves with
the only team in the world to go well

207
00:12:34,059 --> 00:12:37,868
let's build our own motor rather than
going and getting one by one so we got

208
00:12:37,869 --> 00:12:41,439
you built and designed from the ground
up and that's an able to stop demise it

209
00:12:41,439 --> 00:12:43,899
to around ninety-four percent efficiency

210
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:46,749
we're actually looking at increasing
that was ninety-eight percent going

211
00:12:46,749 --> 00:12:47,649
forward

212
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:52,089
so that's an incredible efficiency for
us and the total output is around about

213
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:56,050
five kilowatts we're looking at now
that's about what you run on a sort of

214
00:12:56,050 --> 00:12:57,878
cattle or or similar

215
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:01,600
so we're not using that much power but
we're still doing 70 miles an hour

216
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,290
so by no means is going to set any World
Records for naught to 60 time but it's

217
00:13:05,290 --> 00:13:07,990
only going to set world records in you
know the longest distance shall we say

218
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:09,189
you can travel

219
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,860
now what about the actual electronics
themselves well we have all did we

220
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,139
designed ourselves a patch management
system

221
00:13:17,139 --> 00:13:20,740
we got maximum power point trackers MP
pts to ensure the solar panels are

222
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:22,089
operating at their best

223
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:25,389
we got the solar cells and Driver
management tools so we're going

224
00:13:25,389 --> 00:13:28,240
completely designed from the ground up
ourselves and we've recently partnered

225
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,449
with Seth Conn just have the right in
Newcastle to assist us with with this as

226
00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,109
well

227
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:36,670
we've also got really clever telemetry
so when we're driving across Australia

228
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:41,529
we have been or America or wherever it
is we have a lead and chase car and we

229
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:46,569
were able to feel it feat real-time data
to those cars via of high-powered Wi-Fi

230
00:13:46,569 --> 00:13:50,649
to say well how the motors performing
how the batteries performing so we got

231
00:13:50,649 --> 00:13:54,759
incredibly advanced data and that also
means we can actually control the car we

232
00:13:54,759 --> 00:13:57,970
can set the speed of the cruise when we
are we going along so it's really

233
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,970
incredible feat there

234
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,459
and excuse me we also use standard can
bus in our abs and other electronic

235
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:11,209
components in the system now what about
these solar panels

236
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,390
there they are there's the the cliq they
are in question there's three engine

237
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:15,649
ninety one of them

238
00:14:15,649 --> 00:14:18,890
so we're not see the count them up until
this winter 91 there about twenty four

239
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,830
percent efficient and their
silicon-based so these are the part of

240
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:25,580
the most advanced silicon solar cells
you can get in the world today that are

241
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:29,540
available there are the types gallium
arsenide for instance to go up to forty

242
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,740
percent efficiency

243
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:36,230
we've stopped with twenty percent the
actual weight of the whole solar array

244
00:14:36,230 --> 00:14:40,339
you see there is five kilograms and it's
only a millimeter things there's no

245
00:14:40,339 --> 00:14:42,800
glass or any extra weight holding us
back

246
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:46,370
it's just those raw panels and then
captivated by a company called

247
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,940
government in Germany using a process
that's unbelievable that increases the

248
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:55,070
efficiency for us we've also got a
lithium-ion battery pack on board we

249
00:14:55,070 --> 00:14:58,430
recently have the way to that but
keeping the same energy density so now

250
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,560
actually what we did have 40 kilograms

251
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:03,890
we're now moving to 20 kilograms makes
this lighter makes us able to go faster

252
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,209
for longer

253
00:15:05,209 --> 00:15:09,920
what about you know built a car would
actually do with it but we race it as I

254
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:15,709
said this is a cgi us bus by Ayers Rock
will have to go there this year

255
00:15:15,709 --> 00:15:20,420
pretty cool and that's Australia driving
all the way down the stuart highway

256
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:23,510
highway from Darwin down to Adelaide

257
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:28,910
as I said it's 3,000 kilometers were
actually specifically 3022 and trust me

258
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:32,149
the 22 is the the hardest bit for us

259
00:15:32,149 --> 00:15:36,680
darling to Adelaide as I said and it's
run every two years in the autumn in

260
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:37,750
Australia

261
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:43,060
next one's October next year 2017 we
race from eight till five

262
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:47,140
that's pretty long time to race
incredible heat to give an example we

263
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,710
saw temperatures of 50 degrees
centigrade inside the car and on the

264
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:51,550
panels

265
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:54,699
so our driver was the smallest person on
the team

266
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:58,750
her 13 of them are there to clinch
inside and not touch the carbon fiber

267
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:01,960
while sitting still that's how hot it
was it was be would burn you if you

268
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:02,860
touched it

269
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:07,150
we've got 45 other teams competing as I
said many of whom

270
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:10,300
most of them have six figure or more
budgets we've got one of the lower ones

271
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,240
but we do really well with it because
we've managed to design and build

272
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:17,170
everything ourselves and sees me

273
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:21,430
we've also got various different classes
of entry as an example we run in the

274
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,479
Challenger class

275
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,960
that's designed to go as fast as
possible for as long as possible but

276
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,050
there's also the cruiser class which is
a bit less table like a bit more

277
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:33,130
car-like shall we say I looked a bit
more you know the market car and that's

278
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,800
the actual distance were driving so
we're driving the equivalent of a kind

279
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:40,630
of Norway to Greece to give you an idea
to put it more Eurocentric so pretty

280
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,410
long way

281
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:45,069
now here's some of us are a picture of
us on the road with a land rover

282
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:47,620
discovery they're jagged and over one of
our sponsors

283
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:52,510
as I said we run entirely on solar power
we drive from eight to five

284
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:56,680
we can't where we stop now in 2011 we
kind of learned a lesson because we had

285
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:01,060
to stop and camp we decided to come next
for cattle grid which went well

286
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,839
imagine the noise throughout the night
as road trains thunder over it so the

287
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:06,970
person shows that campsite was not
popular

288
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:11,319
I think he was sacked the next day and
we entirely self-sufficient so we have

289
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:14,199
to collect how we have our water tanks
we have to have the ionized water for

290
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,620
the solar cells we have to have our in
food or in fuel everything we have to do

291
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:21,040
ourselves it's a it's a it's a challenge
for the car and it was a big challenge

292
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,020
for the team

293
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:26,139
let's have a look at some of the photos
from us there are of us there this is up

294
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,560
the pitch you can actually see some of
the cruiser class car as there are kind

295
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:34,000
of two in the center they look a bit
more car-like so we've got the the

296
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,530
challenge of class as well there

297
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:40,030
there's another shot of the cars going
down the pit lane as I said 45 other

298
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:42,910
teams do this so we're in the pits in
Darwin to qualify so there's a

299
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:45,460
qualifying round that we that we enter

300
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,870
and all the teams enter the various
dynamic scrutineering state stages and

301
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:53,770
Static scrutineering stages and that's
in the pit lane getting ready to to

302
00:17:53,770 --> 00:17:57,879
qualify as a team and another shot there
and I show the rest of hidden valley

303
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,360
raceway in Darwin as a great test track
in a great availability for us to build

304
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,840
things and design things at the last
minute we should anything go wrong

305
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,840
that's our motor being slotted into the
car you can see the trading armor and

306
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:11,500
suspension on it and the role who just
behind that sits directly behind the

307
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:16,659
driver it on the left hand side
scrutineering comes along so the drivers

308
00:18:16,659 --> 00:18:20,110
are wait there's a very interesting
technique which is basically we want

309
00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:23,799
them to weigh as little you know we want
them to weighs close to the 80 kilograms

310
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,279
ballast there we have so we have to make
sure the driver is 80 kilograms

311
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:32,169
if they're less than that their balance
it up to it so we can see le there on

312
00:18:32,169 --> 00:18:32,950
the right

313
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:37,299
she was basically force fed water to
increase their weight so we have various

314
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:40,418
tactics that we employ and other teams
employed to make sure that we get every

315
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:45,370
actually kilogram or less kilograms of
ballast to put in the car to a way to

316
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,719
the scrutineer as well

317
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,380
this is us in static scrutineering
inside a big hangar that they've got to

318
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:53,260
the other test track and all the other
teams to scrutinize on things like

319
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:56,620
you're braking distance when you're
doing dynamic scrutineering the design

320
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,699
of the car how many solar cells you've
got the safety systems in a fire

321
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,529
extinguisher city anything

322
00:19:02,529 --> 00:19:06,010
god forbid happen everything is checked
and prove there is a very safe event

323
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:10,450
this is actually managed to qualify we
did encounter a technical issue with the

324
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:15,429
motor is 50 degrees out there so things
do and it's like humans are things to

325
00:19:15,429 --> 00:19:19,840
short-circuit a bit easily shall we say
but undeterred we qualified a lot of

326
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:25,480
teams actually didn't qualify we are one
of the few to do so and this is ask

327
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,409
actually on the road

328
00:19:26,409 --> 00:19:30,460
this is driving from Darwin to adelaide
land rover discovery is flanking us we

329
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,260
had two very kindly provided to us by
Jaguar Land Rover as i said this again

330
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:38,799
driving across that way in proper desert
conditions you can just about see how

331
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,799
sparse and barren it is a real challenge
for us

332
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:48,639
now this is an arc AR don't worry when I
first saw this picture when guys you

333
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,840
didn't tell me about this

334
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,250
when did that happen now this is one of
the Malaysian teams they as you guys are

335
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,720
saying about the battery chemistry

336
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,720
lithium ion and particularly sometimes
the lithium-ion batteries aren't

337
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,140
incredibly susceptible to thermal
runaway if they're damaged

338
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:06,280
this is what happened to the Malaysian
team we got a call over the radio saying

339
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:10,780
guys we got a major problem so we sped
up and you have to basically once a

340
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:12,940
lithium-ion battery start a fire starts

341
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,179
it's not going to stop very quickly so
we have to shovel sand onto it we had

342
00:20:16,179 --> 00:20:19,210
fire extinguishers that we have to
deploy it was a pretty exciting moment

343
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:22,270
they might actually finish the race as
well they managed to rebuild their

344
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,658
batteries rebuild their systems all the
teams pull together to make sure they

345
00:20:25,659 --> 00:20:29,799
could finish a real show camera Audrey
there but incredibly incredibly dramatic

346
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:32,408
site for us to see the driver

347
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:35,770
proving that you could get out in 15
seconds that was that was the limit so

348
00:20:35,770 --> 00:20:39,400
it's a big challenge for us we mustn't
underestimate the challenge there and

349
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,240
the danger

350
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:44,650
this is us on the road fortunately not
on fire that we've stopped on the side

351
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:47,289
of the road just to get everything
sorted so we have various checkpoints we

352
00:20:47,289 --> 00:20:48,100
have to meet

353
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,250
so as an example we have to be at a
certain place at a certain time to make

354
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,700
sure that we are performing correctly
and they check that are we haven't been

355
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,150
tweaking anything on underwear on ways
to the observers we have and this is

356
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:02,890
actually one of things we have to do
whilst there

357
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:06,220
so when we are on the road we have camp
for the evening we have to watch the

358
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,490
solar panels down they get a lot of dust
on them that degrades the efficiency so

359
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:13,600
i have to watch them off but not using
any water using deionized water to

360
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,139
ensure that make sure they're clean and
have the optimal optical quality that we

361
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:19,330
need to perform at twenty-four percent
efficiency

362
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:23,470
again these are so fragile if you touch
them it damages them so we have to be

363
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:24,520
very careful

364
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:27,490
we have to keep saying hands off array
so we have to make sure we didn't touch

365
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:27,970
it

366
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:31,720
very very fragile indeed this is camping
nice evening shot we had as we were

367
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:36,250
settling down for the night so not to
not to do similar to here as opposed

368
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,990
camping in the middle of nowhere

369
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:41,350
although a few more spiders and snakes
and other things as well to get your

370
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:46,360
sleeping back but an incredible up an
adventure for us and is a nice nice shot

371
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:50,860
of the car on one of the final evening
before we reached adelaide and this is

372
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,639
also the finish

373
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,520
we managed to finish the spiral
technical issues minutes to complete the

374
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:57,639
whole 3,000 kilometers from start to
finish

375
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:00,730
we did manage to do actually drive all
of it unfortunately we still finished

376
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:05,140
with big feet next year we're going back
and gonna be the first ever UK team we

377
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,010
hope to go from Darwin's adelaide
entirely without stopping without any

378
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:10,269
malfunctions so

379
00:22:10,269 --> 00:22:13,479
we set a big goal because no team has
ever done that from the UK before

380
00:22:14,889 --> 00:22:18,609
again this is a strike the finish line
is a big event well as I said every two

381
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:21,789
years he's been going since about the
nineteen eighties when a couple of drunk

382
00:22:21,789 --> 00:22:24,879
Australian said let's go and have a bit
of fun with solar panels and see how

383
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,189
fast we can go because it's hot and
sunny

384
00:22:27,190 --> 00:22:30,309
so it's been going for a number of years
this event but it's really great to be

385
00:22:30,309 --> 00:22:32,889
the premier so the race

386
00:22:32,889 --> 00:22:37,330
what about other things we do we do
other events we want to showcase our

387
00:22:37,330 --> 00:22:40,928
technology to you guys now the car's not
here is these back in durham being fixed

388
00:22:40,929 --> 00:22:45,519
and being worked on enhanced but we take
this two major events we get huge

389
00:22:45,519 --> 00:22:46,929
publicity people go

390
00:22:46,929 --> 00:22:49,959
what on earth is this thing why is there
a table with solar panels on it or why

391
00:22:49,959 --> 00:22:50,499
is there

392
00:22:50,499 --> 00:22:54,009
what was the other one they had a boat
people think it's a boat this is us

393
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:58,450
meeting Prince Michael of Kent and as a
nigel mansell at the london motor show

394
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,509
it was a big shock to me because i was
chatting to the stand next to me I

395
00:23:01,509 --> 00:23:04,749
wasn't told that they were coming around
and managed to miss him on the first

396
00:23:04,749 --> 00:23:08,379
attempt but then he came over and had a
very nice chat with us about the car

397
00:23:08,379 --> 00:23:11,379
so very nice job and then if you
recognize this guy

398
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:15,099
your body more used to seeing him with a
white suit and helmet on

399
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:19,359
that was the stick Ben Collins he came
along and was very keen to see our car

400
00:23:19,359 --> 00:23:22,869
and find out more about it again I
didn't recognize him into the actually

401
00:23:22,869 --> 00:23:27,189
introduced himself as he was so was
pretty exciting to see him

402
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:29,799
that's myself talking to tiff needell
that's probably when I told him about

403
00:23:29,799 --> 00:23:32,649
the malay that reaction he's got what I
want to talk about the Malaysian team

404
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:37,570
and the fire they had a guy like that
shot of him and I doing a Q&A they're

405
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,899
not too dissimilar to this kind of
environment actually that's coming back

406
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:43,539
next year as well so keep an eye out for
it will be back next year hopefully as

407
00:23:43,539 --> 00:23:43,989
well

408
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,679
we were then really excited because we
were invited off the back of that to

409
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,469
come to probably the biggest motor event
in the world

410
00:23:50,469 --> 00:23:55,359
goodwood festival of speed they're
leaving idea that had 68 million people

411
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,639
hear about it around the world that just
one event

412
00:23:57,639 --> 00:24:00,728
hundreds of thousands came and source
that's the good that's the sculpture

413
00:24:00,729 --> 00:24:01,929
there by BMW

414
00:24:01,929 --> 00:24:06,399
we had a stand there that we managed to
get this is the car they're tracking a

415
00:24:06,399 --> 00:24:09,998
great deal of interest is it really
really cool but the kids as we build a

416
00:24:09,999 --> 00:24:13,869
new canopy for it as well and that's our
as i stand there representing durham

417
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:17,959
university and all our sponsors we see
huge reach and we see huge interest from

418
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:24,140
all ages and by all ages particular
reference as last week before last the

419
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,220
last week was last week

420
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,220
we're at the science museum we actually
exhibited for three days there's part of

421
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:31,610
the antenna live event and we were
featured on a number of programs in the

422
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,969
London area so we get really big
interest and kids going how on earth

423
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:36,140
does this thing work

424
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,399
its massive it's an incredible feat of
engineering and I know for example our

425
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:45,709
team principal saw during so the car
that jets and looking one in 2004 2008

426
00:24:45,710 --> 00:24:49,100
time and his team principal and now it's
gone on to it so you've been hugely

427
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,350
inspired and just quickly recognize
these are the list of sponsors that we

428
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:55,309
have

429
00:24:55,309 --> 00:24:59,629
so a variety of small and large
companies climb online as an example

430
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:03,710
recently signed a party might have heard
of a guy called Lord Sugar his

431
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:06,950
apprentice mark right the Australian
champion found a digital-marketing

432
00:25:06,950 --> 00:25:08,000
agency

433
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,659
he's building a new website for us
that's incredible new sponsorship deal

434
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:15,529
signed with the jaguar land rover in a
series of others so and we continue to

435
00:25:15,529 --> 00:25:18,289
look to expand this some of them like
connecting with our engineers and

436
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:21,980
offering them jobs others like inspiring
the next generation and others like

437
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,890
saying here's some technology going to
show how good it is

438
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:28,159
so as I said this car the 70 miles an
hour

439
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:36,380
it weighs 200 kilograms and uses five
times this power than a toy surprise but

440
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,279
what's next

441
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,390
that's the past what about the future
well I went into too much detail because

442
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:45,440
there's a lot of things which were
working on the economy mention but we've

443
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,210
got a very exciting future head

444
00:25:47,210 --> 00:25:51,740
we've got all the events coming up
leading up to Australia 2017 going back

445
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:54,470
to Australia racing all the way across
the outback

446
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:56,760
we look forward to welcoming

447
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,810
a lot of people to see us at future
events and we're very excited for what's

448
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,500

can see that our new values that we've

450
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,450
come up with of showcase educate and
inspire are truly showing by myself and

451
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,480
others members of the team and indeed
the car that we've designed and built

452
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,560
from scratch

453
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,610
this was a toilet a labor of love that
we were up to a four-year most mornings

454
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,020
getting it ready

455
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,720
most of the guys didn't sleep while they
were in Australia the team principal

456
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,490
told me at the best flight back

457
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:30,180
so why is that he said well I slept for
the whole 13 hours

458
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,720
so pretty much from Malaysia to London
so I remember going to bed

459
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:37,439
the falling asleep just as the plane
took off and then next thing I know I

460
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:41,310
was in London so he had very little
sleep over the entire race is some

461
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:45,270
really grueling challenge but we are
very excited to be going back there next

462
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:48,930
year i think i've just finished on time
which is good

463
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:52,860
I went any Q&A on the stage i'll just be
down at the front if you want to come

464
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,580
and ask me any questions about the
technology we've done the events we have

465

whatsoever i'm more than happy to answer
