00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,090
Heather

2
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:13,150
one thank you

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:16,160
coming I'm now going to hand over to

4
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,400
I'm just making sure I got that right
there just heading over to John is going

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,689
to talk to you about his self-made
eco-house so hands together for John

6
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,070
hi

7
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:34,640
so I'm gonna have a quick sort of
overview really i'm not going to go into

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,290
too much detail but i just thought if
you want to us and more questions

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:42,410
apart from that the end down but you can
come and find me around site somewhere

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:52,280
so I'm this is a the house I'd decided
to build myself Adam say well Adam when

11
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,520
maybe my for looking for a house we
decided we wanted to actually born with

12
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,829
a large garden maybe had a lot meant to
read wanted to so grown vegetables in

13
00:01:00,829 --> 00:01:05,810
our garden and that sort of progressed a
little bit as we started looking we

14
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:12,350
decided to me might want to have some
animals and so it started looking around

15
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,660
for places that they have an acre and
I'm not a sort of snowboard a little bit

16
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,740
more

17
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:28,610
oh and yeah they even thought to make
this would be nice that we never thought

18
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:33,170
we could afford that and then I'm the
device being the chief decisions

19
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,399
decision-making by your house and we
came into this time

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,550
well i thought was an ideal opportunity
I'm set to arrive to look at it as we

21
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,690
had a 646 hold six months also at the
time and indeed breastfeeding so she

22
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:52,550
stayed in the car I had a look around

23
00:01:52,550 --> 00:01:57,619
I decided that it's going to be a good
one so I went and bought this for that

24
00:01:57,619 --> 00:02:05,810
had actually see again and i'm a little
bit of a mess but are their mind that

25
00:02:05,810 --> 00:02:09,410
this was after a couple of guys who
spent a day's work try to clear the

26
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:10,568
stuff away

27
00:02:10,568 --> 00:02:17,078
so you can actually see the house and
are issues that agreement because we

28
00:02:17,079 --> 00:02:23,620
have always knew the other to get a
couple of acres and a nice house was

29
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:27,849
never going to happen so we were going
for ever building plot in some respect

30
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:33,129
so this had a house on it so we're going
to be able to rebuild a house there and

31
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:38,768
it was doing I am development boundary
of the village as well and so one of the

32
00:02:38,769 --> 00:02:44,230
first priorities we ended up having to
do which was there an interesting one

33
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:45,159
with them

34
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:49,030
we have to build a garage first reach

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:54,219
this was actually gonna be our our
second polity we were going to build

36
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:58,000
this but we haven't we discovered we had
that's in the house so we had to build

37
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,620
them a nice college first for the
bathroom - I'm but this became very

38
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:06,129
useful because I could install lots and
lots of the house building stuff in it

39
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:10,780
and so on to the real subject has faced

40
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:17,530
I'm we were required so we can largely
minded say we did a bit of looking into

41
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:22,720
what we could do on the eco-friendly
house side of things and some of the

42
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:27,099
first things and when you do searching
on this sort of thing is that they're

43
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:32,409
the first golden already is 2 inch late
and to put lots more insulation on it

44
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:36,790
I need for even more information on if
you can because installation is really

45
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:41,228
actually quite cheap and it stops you
having any sort of heating bills to any

46
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:44,500
extent really later on

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:49,150
but after I mean after you've instigated
a lot you start finding that there to

48
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:54,550
half of your heat last thing becomes
because at the the house leaks air and

49
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:01,330
all the war where escaping the house and
and this is one of the interesting

50
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,170
things that build this don't quite
understand yet while they didn't five

51
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:07,239
years ago when we were building the
house debts

52
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,720
there's a lot of attention to detail and
a lot of things off I found out about

53
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:15,370
how to make it a house airtight heated
not losing all your warm air for no real

54
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:23,320
reason and and then we also looked at
him too low impact of materials and so

55
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:30,070
you'll see a thing called passive house
which is kind of make a and no ng house

56
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:36,040
and running but it's a problem I have
with the passive houses that has no idea

57
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:41,560
about how much concrete save use and how
much of it is logical impact that does

58
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,669
on the environment

59
00:04:42,669 --> 00:04:48,370
building a house in the first place so
we wanted to do and bailed out would

60
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:52,780
mostly because that sort of is carbon
negative because you're storing would be

61
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:58,599
a CIT in the walls and got to have any
sort of really sort of trying to avoid a

62
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,020
Dominion is work that requires a huge
amount of energy to actually process the

63
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,909
other medium in the first place

64
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,120
I mean one of the other guy all the
girls was if we're going to go through

65
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,250
all this effort of building a house

66
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:13,750
we're never going to move the gate so we
tried to decide one that was going to

67
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,220
meet all our future needs to some extent
on today's is just making it a little

68
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:26,830
bigger than you really can't afford so
on the low impact side of things and I

69
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:33,130
want to do remove as much as possible in
dec 02 on the environment and in AC otey

70
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:39,909
use on constructions that's why we
avoided an ammonium and such

71
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:48,190
I know is there's also a time I don't
seem to think its submission and fast

72
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,190
these days there's this thing called
code for sustainable homes

73
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,330
that has a load of guidelines on how to
go about making a day returning a

74
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,099
zero-carbon house

75
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,690
the problem we have with a zero-carbon
houses to really go to that level you

76
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,430
need to generate energy on site somehow
and we have we have too many trees

77
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:13,140
shading are rules to be able to our
brief to be able to do and side side of

78
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,010
power of electricity which is what the
sort of thing wanted it to do

79
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:22,380
I know but when it comes to actually
build in the house is all sorts of

80
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,159
material so it's we went for it in the
frame house

81
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:36,240
- D word for the wooden walls ab we buy
used some eco-friendly paid so all the

82
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
glassware can order

83
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:42,750
normal mouse in the house is that are
impacted doesn't contain stuff like

84
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:47,669
titanium dioxide to make stuff white
because that's quite a bad thing

85
00:06:47,669 --> 00:06:52,830
environment making stuff as well in the
first place and we where we try not to

86
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:55,590
use too much plastic if we could inside
the house

87
00:06:55,590 --> 00:06:59,820
some of that was unavoidable but that's
how it goes

88
00:07:00,570 --> 00:07:07,200
so yeah I mean you can watch all these
grand design programs and they give you

89
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,580
an impression that builders may know
about some of these new technologies but

90
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,200
if you talk to actually build it so if
you what grand designs or no and they're

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,990
all quite a bit and that field for them
so it's quite difficult to buy a fire

92
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:22,800
builder

93
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,540
so I mean the builders we talk to you I
mean Grand Designs the time had this

94
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,890
idea of co 2 negative concrete but none
of the builders knew anything about it

95
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:37,590
and so there's a lot of all battles and
that was one of the ones i sort of four

96
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:38,820
went on really

97
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:45,270
so I mean we decided not in the same
house and there's a once you've got him

98
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:47,039
the same that we got to insulate it

99
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,640
I'm so you got to fit in and fill the
timber frame somewhere

100
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:55,450
and some of the ones that i found most
interesting is a straw bale but the

101
00:07:55,450 --> 00:08:00,280
straw bales actually a lot of labor to
actually put in

102
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,049
I'm and you have to go through a lot of
effort of finding a farmer who can build

103
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:08,320
your very tight straw bale in the first
place

104
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:13,180
and because i had a couple of a young
kid at the time I was working

105
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:20,080
I'm about an hour's drive away I we
tried to get at main building through it

106
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:24,340
do best a house for us and say that
wasn't even aware of this most

107
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:28,630
strawberryland him create as well as a
nice interesting technology but it is

108
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:34,510
out of time and still there's nothing
quite quite you and warm sell this one

109
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,780
I haven't had really heard of myself but
my architect

110
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,098
I'm mentioned it and that was actually
probably a good choice if we went with

111
00:08:42,099 --> 00:08:47,290
warm cell is I'm the term recycled
newspaper but i think it's when they

112
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:51,610
have a load of printed newspaper that
they don't sell so it's still in good

113
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:55,540
condition they did not mention the app
makes over the bed blonde so it doesn't

114
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,709
get more do anything

115
00:08:56,710 --> 00:09:03,760
and they've got this really sort of
fluffy tightly packed stuff that you

116
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,210
can't ban because there's no there's no
should I have inside it

117
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:12,910
I'm and the good thing is that it's
being unlocked for quite a while and so

118
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:18,370
some of the bells we talked to actually
build a house before using it and

119
00:09:18,370 --> 00:09:23,830
there's other things you have after lots
of rest looking

120
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:31,390
you can win days one of the things that
also we chose and initial initial search

121
00:09:31,390 --> 00:09:34,180
you will make you think that would
windows are premium product you have to

122
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:38,410
pay a lot more than a DP bc one day but
if you actually look around and find a

123
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:42,880
local timber in your local carpentry or
j chinese place they could make one days

124
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,260
they can actually do it for a similar
price two upvc and it

125
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,600
you can then use and linseed oil paint
which is a all traditional way to paint

126
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,820
you in days

127
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,870
not a not an eighties way to thank you
win days that they want to say if you if

128
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:02,040
you get to Papa join and you answered
all the page that those dishes glass

129
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,410
states like 60 years and the advantage
of witnesses said they were prepared for

130
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:08,189
that

131
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:15,120
upvc tends to get thrown away and also
on the structural insulated panels and

132
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,610
that's another building technique i
looked into and that's where they sort

133
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,710
of had these big panels that have gotten
plywood dog shit bored either side and

134
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,420
I've got a few PVR fame and stuck
between them

135
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm that a the five minutes . between is
not really it doesn't really

136
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,040
eco-friendly enough for us

137
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:46,980
Adam and they can paint as i mentioned
i'm so when it comes to power in the

138
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:47,850
house

139
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:53,580
there's a few things I i was looking
into how about how to create energy and

140
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:59,190
how to him here at the house in the
winter months because although you can

141
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:02,940
build a passive house even the
Passivhaus standard which tries to have

142
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,940
a minimal footprint asst and then she
sighed as possible

143
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:13,830
I requires some space heating to some
extent and and I tend to have a a

144
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,750
ventilation system which has been
heating in it but my concern was with

145
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:23,550
kids really was and you get and the kids
leaving the doors open and calling the

146
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,479
house down too much

147
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,030
so in the only energy front of things we
looked at solar power that can be your

148
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:34,860
your normal pv which is you're actually
tangle set

149
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,580
most people accustomed to you can also
get there are more things so you get am

150
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:44,010
two types of some more panels which have
had more stuff which generally a tap the

151
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:50,460
water in that in the panel so you have a
flat plate 1 which I'm is the more

152
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,440
traditional one any of these new one

153
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:56,130
last but not like you anymore that these
new ones called evacuated tube ones

154
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,000
which is a bit like a thermos fast he
had this long tube with the heat pipe in

155
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,360
it

156
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,350
in a vacuum and there was one of the
technologies we want to because they

157
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:13,560
work better and the winter and in the
spring and autumn times where you get a

158
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:20,518
little bit more energy out and then the
flat panel and we couldn't we have trees

159
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:23,490
Irish a during our south facing grief

160
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:29,010
so we couldn't really use a soda side of
things sparkle to that I'm i also like

161
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:33,930
to win power and when power was it gets
quite expensive when you want a really

162
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:38,550
big wind turbine and probably start
annoying your neighbors and I was also

163
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:41,040
going to go to cause huge problems we
have bats

164
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,149
so there are bats weren't gonna go but
we'll probably going to get permission

165
00:12:45,149 --> 00:12:53,310
for that and there's also a lot of you
go to love the South build type shows

166
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,579
i'll try and push on to these ideas to
the ground source heat pump more air

167
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:02,310
source heat pump and the problem i have
with those is they're quite expensive

168
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:07,140
and that you're really just using
electricity still to heat your house

169
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:13,740
so if you're somewhere where you don't
have names gas we could have got me and

170
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,640
asked if we wanted to

171
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,310
if there's somebody got mains gas is
probably more environmentally friendly

172
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:22,229
teasing - gasps and it is to install
your a source heat pump

173
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,290
well you guys the ground source heat
pumps the one where you have a big tube

174
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,880
into your garden and you take the heat
at the garden with electric type like

175
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,930
your French you like if how you frig
works and put that into your room and

176
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:38,040
the a source of the problem i have the a
source ones is the most efficient in the

177
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:41,370
summer when you don't need it and at
least efficient when it's really

178
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:47,279
freezing outside and it's cold and then
you actually need to eat some of the

179
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,720
other options we looked into a burning
wood and we also did look into - gasps

180
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,089
but decided not to connect up yet
because that's going to cost us

181
00:13:57,089 --> 00:14:01,320
foreground and also there that you can
you can take your house with you i'm

182
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,230
just using a normal makes electricity

183
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:09,840
and so the side of tiles are as I said
that there's the PV is not suitable

184
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:15,240
workers as I understand it you get you
can have your south-facing roof love so

185
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,230
the panels

186
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:20,820
Beth a tree mask still just a small tent
to Center for those panels

187
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,380
that's it you're the efficiency drops
right off on your solar panels you don't

188
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:31,110
really make much electricity and I
believe now there are it held in vertice

189
00:14:31,110 --> 00:14:35,760
can power so you can take the harvest a
powerful one thing out of time but at

190
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,370
the time i was looking into that that
that was a new technology that wasn't

191
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,510
quite released

192
00:14:39,510 --> 00:14:44,160
I'm so the flat panels and I said that
sort of traditional bit like a black

193
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:51,209
girl aged 80 by the whole thing is just
got water in it and say that that is

194
00:14:51,210 --> 00:15:01,290
affected more by the cold weather than
am evacuated tubes and yes so did you

195
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,589
pass on the actual heating is that the
Passivhaus world

196
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:09,120
you still need hot water people still
expect with hot water to be there

197
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,010
available every day of the year

198
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:19,290
so even if they even a passing you to
get your water somehow and for us and

199
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:22,439
especially living into it we we find the
space heating between november

200
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:27,600
february's when we start thinking about
whether we need to heat a house a bit or

201
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,200
not

202
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,260
outside these months it was just they
don't care they just don't think that

203
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:36,569
I'll whether we've got enough eat or
water 27 stone and we have a couple of

204
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,440
kids now so they they running at the
house and don't close the doors and

205
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,460
stuff so if we went for that whole pass
out house problem

206
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,520
I think we didn't have actually some
type of heating behind it

207
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:51,569
we made struggle so on are

208
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:59,720
Cena and so in the end i went with am I
thing called a step there more store so

209
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:05,360
I am thermistor is sort of best or out
as a large hot water tank been reverse

210
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:10,880
so instead of using the water in the
tank the water in the tank is what you

211
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:17,060
heat up and the actual color than the
tank is what you put your cold water

212
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,939
mains into any out the top it comes out
as hot water and domains pressure and

213
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:27,560
that's good for showers and stuff you
don't need any of their that shall come

214
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,760
to anything like that

215
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,600
we just showered the I am mains water
pressure

216
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:39,380
so we find that the am during their
spring summer autumn we get in a hot

217
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:47,600
water and really quite well and we just
find that when we have cloudy days we

218
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,740
just plan our showers or bars they were
out of the study days really

219
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:58,700
I'm out of work to do here house during
the winter we have am wood-burning stave

220
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:04,939
which is actually a German model and I
spent days i think on the internet

221
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:07,699
trying to find the best one and I think
I found it

222
00:17:07,699 --> 00:17:11,089
so this one's got I am I think all the
water jacket

223
00:17:11,089 --> 00:17:15,770
that's not just on the back of it comes
all the sides and the top as well that's

224
00:17:15,770 --> 00:17:19,520
that's good because we've done a very
well insulated house and we find that

225
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:25,579
and the one kind of what it puts into
the room and then it is so it's a 10

226
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,859
kilowatt and boy last days

227
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:32,510
it's dave your normal sort of small
state of about five kilowatts

228
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:37,610
so this was twice as aight size of a
small one and the one kind of wanted

229
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,350
persons to him

230
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,310
where does really like but a large
kitchen diner and that's it still can

231
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,020
get that quite warm

232
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:49,850
efforts are careful I'm and all the
other day i can what goes into that big

233
00:17:49,850 --> 00:17:51,889
thermal store that we can run there
enough

234
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:59,870
underfloor heating off I'm but we

235
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:05,840
that's don't store has a couple of Adam
imagine haters in it as well just in

236
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,810
case we need to use it and we're too
lazy at some point

237
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:21,889
not that we really come to that yet that
talks about working

238
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,140
uh-huh so the performance of our house

239
00:18:27,950 --> 00:18:31,130
I think this was with one of the bigger
nose i was having when I was trying to

240
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:34,670
design and build the house but you can
get all these e value calculations all

241
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,470
these sad calculations but you still
don't know what that means in reality

242
00:18:39,470 --> 00:18:51,350
i'm so we've got a better than what the
the sub Scouts we may actually an energy

243
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:56,060
rated beyond the SAP Scouts because we
don't have any actual electric

244
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:02,450
generation take care about and what we
find that when it's I'm freezing in the

245
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:06,620
in the middle of winter and we have the
house at 20 degrees c and he drops a

246
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:10,129
couple sees it too greasy every night
and that's where that big and you are

247
00:19:10,130 --> 00:19:12,200
under floor heating on it or anything

248
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:18,860
I'm and that the self at tubes do do a
good job of providing a hot water doing

249
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:19,189
this

250
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:24,800
Marshall october and we have a slight
worry occasion in the summer when we got

251
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:30,980
a few hot days and that the the set of
hands pumping away in the tanks at 210

252
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:35,870
degrees and the time is getting 2 95 and
stuff that hasn't seemed to cause any

253
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:39,979
problems yet there's but when you get a
solid the austin saw that that high it

254
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:48,320
seems to drop lose quite a lot overnight
anyway i'm leaving the winter the am if

255
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:52,070
we put the underfloor heating on and
really cool down at the thermal store if

256
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,189
you get a nice sunny day in the winter
we still get a bit of energy out of it

257
00:19:55,190 --> 00:20:04,490
which is useful I'm one of the things
that was on my real big richness to get

258
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:08,420
the builders install wizard the lane
water harvesting system but they're

259
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:10,490
going to charge me ten grand for it

260
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:15,680
I'm rate seems like a lot for just a
tank capacity attacking the ground

261
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:20,270
so about a year after Beltran

262
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:25,250
our company is after we moved in nothing
and I did it myself so that I got him to

263
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,470
put the sort Sol phrase all to the same
place

264
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:31,010
I don't spend about a thousand pounds on
high we can do you got to dig a trench

265
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,630
one of the things we really needed we
wanted water into a field anyway so I

266
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:38,330
love but why did Doug a big trench

267
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:44,659
I'm haha her hips slightly on the
civilian side of the way in hell i

268
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:50,840
bought 12 IBC's which are these big Adam
thousand need to contain us at the ship

269
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:56,360
liquid around the world are bad 10 days
into the ground covered in concrete perp

270
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:02,360
made it next to it and then put laps to
filled with the other and in the

271
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:06,350
trenches got everything you never think
of and that feeds back to the house and

272
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:10,159
that flashes our toilet window washing
machine so that sort of 1 i've actually

273
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:17,000
got after winning that sort of took two
thirds of our water bill and so some of

274
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,080
the other tack

275
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:21,800
I was just as i'm a geek i was i was
busy

276
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,700
it's in the early stages try to get on
towards the end of the project ended up

277
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:30,500
big I just want to get a house finished
so i put 1 y temperature sensors in all

278
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,790
the floors and staffing in the walls a
bit as a maybe I'll daughter at the

279
00:21:34,790 --> 00:21:38,659
house and the heating system but in
reality that's for me over killed

280
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:44,000
because we find that one when we attend
the on the floor heating system a couple

281
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,330
of hours later they could take this
court to cold anyway into workable

282
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:51,679
without the fire began to have to put a
wood burning fire on to actually hit

283
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:59,030
house and the other problem is the that
because the house is so well insulated

284
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:04,129
it doesn't really need that fine control
so as for me a pipe dream know that we

285
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,930
are finished

286
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:10,060
but I also program can cut five
networking everywhere so every Power

287
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:16,629
Point and houses got a cat five bucks on
the next to it because I could i don't

288
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:23,350
know i am working on it not as am an
open source energy monitoring that is

289
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:29,050
i'm sort of setting up now sir to
control with stuff there's a lot of

290
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:31,780
things that I learned and this is just a
few of them

291
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:38,740
I'm one of the things I've in hindsight
I maybe could have done would be to put

292
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,860
windows in the house claim of the house
get mortgage

293
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,740
I then use that mortgage money to build
a house cuz ya without house their

294
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:48,250
mortgage

295
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,240
you can't get a mortgage and get
self-build mortgage for that a too

296
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:59,560
expensive and be very quite restricted i
had the problems like the death

297
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:05,560
110 notes of hot water tank went into
the attic and I didn't think it really

298
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:10,419
looks strong enough and the bad melon
meeting minutes from the builders that

299
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:14,140
they said it was strong enough then the
builders sort of went bankrupt me

300
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:18,910
and then so i went to the timber frame
company said did you make them very

301
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:21,760
strong enough to hold water tank and
they go now

302
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,680
we weren't told about that so I'm glad
that I i did keep an eye on anything but

303
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:35,620
I just worried that what would happen if
i wasn't really on the ball but you live

304
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:40,179
in that I mean it could watch what grand
designs and there's all sorts of went

305
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,450
weird of 14 building stuff on God
designs

306
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,950
thanks again talk to you normal did
builders nice and haven't heard of any

307
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:54,310
of them riches interesting time

308
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:58,899
one of the things had but one of things
i ended up doing with the plot i bought

309
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,420
was a notion riches and on the day that
you're there the or should we have to

310
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:07,720
pay over ten percent of the deposit
which issues you're not going to like

311
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:11,910
check out for ID and yeah that's when
you exchange contracts

312
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:17,940
Dave and you have to be ready I don't
have the video option is good exercise

314
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:27,840
I'm stay one of the best I think things
i did do the same to be a load of times

315
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,470
to him

316
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:32,250
hire a proper professional
spray-painting machine the house we

317
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:37,050
built is a four-bedroom house with in
the attic space we actually use so i

318
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:41,100
made the pitch a bit bigger is if you
got a huge active actually that we have

319
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:46,860
a nicely done much with because we can't
afford it bad that four bedroom house

320
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,449
with a huge attic

321
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,660
I managed to Spain mystery because of
mystery case of paint

322
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,620
I'm painting walls different colors to
some extent and after weekend and got

323
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,239
there because you just mask off the
window so you put in

324
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:07,920
don't care about everything else really
I just go to town this paper machine you

325
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:11,580
can you can get a i'm sort of
rectangular piece of aluminium on the

326
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:16,020
boat on the stick so you can split a
white root your white ceiling and you

327
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:18,990
can hold it in the corner and going to
play your balls

328
00:25:18,990 --> 00:25:22,410
you get two of you and one holding that
the stair couldn't you the other one

329
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:23,580
spray painting

330
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:31,500
yeah as I safe 8 rooms will say enough
and we came three coats and my last

331
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,130
bears

332
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:40,440
if you are building an airtight house is
you do need a second amv HR system

333
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,590
images of mechanical ventilation heat
recovery system

334
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:51,629
I'm one of the problems with them react
we when we first moved in we were quite

335
00:25:51,630 --> 00:25:55,710
finished . it all sleeping in delivery
and we have serious concentration

336
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:58,710
problems for the first week until i
actually got my awesome together

337
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:04,290
did it got the m-th arts commission and
the conversation has disappeared

338
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:09,510
it wasn't an issue anymore and it also
removes the need to have trickle vents

339
00:26:09,510 --> 00:26:13,530
on the windows which is another way you
lose heat it stops you needing any

340
00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:17,160
extractor fans are the bathrooms or the
kitchen or anything like that it's just

341
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:20,850
I it's got heat exchange on it so it

342
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,850
why does it taste it and fresh air in
from the outside

343
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,639
and passes after in a change was all the
air is sucking out from the real and

344
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:35,488
moisture m0 kitchen your bathroom so so
worn out just kitchens bathrooms passes

345
00:26:35,489 --> 00:26:42,239
student in heat exchanger and uses that
hate to hit warm up the hair coming in

346
00:26:42,239 --> 00:26:47,850
I'm the SAPS calculation stuff that says
howard officially houses don't seem to

347
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:52,379
like it for some reason to consider that
Jesus small amount of electricity

348
00:26:52,379 --> 00:26:57,988
positive thoughts constantly but it
removes to me to have any ventilation of

349
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:01,320
the way and it's a it's one you can
control

350
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:07,710
so I'm i believe this time for questions
if anybody has any me or you can always

351
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,859
email me and come find me later

352
00:27:10,859 --> 00:27:15,178
and there's also i am one of the good
things is there in in bath

353
00:27:15,869 --> 00:27:19,678
I'll i was living and rest of the time
in bar there's a self-build the group

354
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,600
set up where it's just like her father

355
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,748
I'm people had fighting challenges
building their own houses and is that I

356
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,190
found really good

357
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:33,480
I think we have time for a question if
it's answered quickly maybe two

358
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,690
I saw the gentleman here at the back

359
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:42,659
first I'm going to hand you the mic cool
thanks for the talk

360
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:46,379
um baba internet provision doing that
you seem to have picked a random piece

361
00:27:46,379 --> 00:27:48,178
of one somewhere outside the village

362
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:53,009
so it may look like around the place
like it's actually a village it's got

363
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:58,200
about 300 houses and we we were actually
part of development boundaries the house

364
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,899
sold for the corner so that the house is
like on the beltline closest advantage

365
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:05,279
in the house was actually

366
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,389
and when we moved in yeah i was getting
about two-and-a-half Meg download speed

367
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:18,359
but now with the somerset and Evan
broadband initiative that actually can

368
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:21,210
put fiber to the cabinet in the village

369
00:28:21,210 --> 00:28:26,489
so I've now got 70 make which I'm quite
amazing because all of the sort that was

370
00:28:26,489 --> 00:28:27,359
never gonna happen

371
00:28:27,359 --> 00:28:32,279
ok and it's now four o'clock so if you
have any more questions for John just

372
