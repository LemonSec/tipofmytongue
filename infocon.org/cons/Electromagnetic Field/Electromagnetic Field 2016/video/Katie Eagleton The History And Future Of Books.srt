1
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,890
ok hello everybody and welcome to stage
be and we're going to start off nice and

2
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:19,950
relaxed so i'm going to do to myself
right of them having a big formal

3
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:22,000
introduction

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,780
I'm Katie Eagleton please forgive the
slightly corporate slides I last gave

5
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:30,849
this talk on behalf of my work which is
the British Library and on-site here you

6
00:00:30,849 --> 00:00:34,120
probably have seen me running around as
one of the first a team

7
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,500
so this is a talk about books because
that's my job but I'm also around on

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:42,550
site as one of the EMF crew so delighted
to take an hour out to talk about

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,449
something else

10
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:49,330
so at the British Library I look after a
team and collections from Asia and

11
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:54,099
Africa so from Turkey to Japan to South
Africa and what I'm going to talk about

12
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:57,910
today is some of the ways that gives me
a different perspective on this issue

13
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:01,660
around what the history of the book
looks like and what that means its

14
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,820
digital future might look like I'm and I
should say it's a talk that grew out of

15
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,850
rage at some of the tech journalism
which gets a bit overexcited about the

16
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:14,140
death of the book

17
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:19,360
so it's a sort of thinly disguised
response to some of the the lack of

18
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,300
debate and the lack of of depth in some
of the discussions around them so I

19
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,590
thought I'd start with something really
predictably exactly like you'd expect a

20
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:34,360
book to be this is shakespeare's first
folio the first collected edition of all

21
00:01:34,360 --> 00:01:36,939
of Shakespeare's plays it comes between
covers

22
00:01:36,939 --> 00:01:41,710
it's got pages it turns the pages you
read it and there are some but not many

23
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:46,809
pictures that's kind of a classic book
and we're really familiar with it if if

24
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:49,210
somebody put this book into your hand

25
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,929
I mean they'd be unlikely to because
it's really valuable and there's only a

26
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,829
certain number in the world but if they
did you know how to read it you know how

27
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,298
you as a person related to this object
in your hand and I think that's

28
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:04,090
something really important about books
there about people

29
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:07,659
they're not just about the words and the
content of them there about the way

30
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:12,370
people use them in the kinds of things
they do with them and arguably even with

31
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,220
a book that says famous of shakespeare's
first folio

32
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,609
we don't know enough yet about how
readers read it

33
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:21,410
so the people side of the story isn't
always clear

34
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:26,359
as you think and the story of the book
if you sort of think about the history

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:30,650
of the book typically goes a bit like
there was rioting and then there were

36
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:35,240
books and it was all very inconvenient
and then people came up with this format

37
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,480
of the book the Codex with with boards
and pages but that for me is a bit of a

38
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,130
Eurocentric story because some of the
earliest writing is from China and it

39
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:49,130
wasn't written in books it was written
on bones like this one

40
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:54,200
this is about 3,000 years old it's an
Oracle bone from Shang Dynasty China and

41
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,290
the really amazing thing about these is
they're different nations that tell you

42
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:01,130
whether it's going to rain or whether
you should travel but they also record

43
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,530
the names of the kings of the Shang
Dynasty

44
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,980
so they're kind of historical documents
as well and they were some of the first

45
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:10,850
proof of the existence of the Shang
Dynasty when these things were found

46
00:03:10,850 --> 00:03:14,720
I'm not sure if this is a book I mean
it's bone with characters on but it's

47
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,870
some of the earliest writing and it's
one of the earliest things in the

48
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,700
british library collection and if you
think about China just because I'm

49
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,850
trying to keep out of the kind of
European mindset a bit here

50
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:31,070
the next part of the story is books that
are written on bamboo strips like the

51
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:34,940
one I put up on the screen with
characters running vertically and string

52
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,530
holding the bamboo strips together so
they roll up and you can carry them

53
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:40,370
around

54
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,959
you can get more text onto these these
are basically books they don't look much

55
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,650
like the books that were used to but
they are they can contain information

56
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,260
and they can they can contain lots of
different types of things in one book

57
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:00,140
and of course once you've got to this
format a sort of scroll format you can

58
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,679
get to things like this which is a
picture of the library cave from Moscow

59
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,340
in

60
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:09,110
done wiring which is in northwest China
and about a thousand years ago these

61
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,150
amazing Buddhist caves had an extensive
library of scrolls and in the picture

62
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:17,180
you can see the scrolls piled up in the
library cave

63
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:23,120
so you unroll them to read them and
that's part of the practice around these

64
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,389
caves their part of the life of these
Buddhists and they're part of the life

65
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,560
of these caves

66
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,940
so this doesn't look very much like a
book either but it is and this is a

67
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:38,000
library even though it doesn't look much
like a library when you get a bit later

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,650
on in Chinese history so the ming
dynasty 14 15th century in the European

69
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,909
calendar you start to get this kind of
thing which is a book

70
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:51,650
it's a concertina folded Paige but since
bound and it looks like a book it feels

71
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:56,388
like a book as we recognize it and this
is actually part of it amazing

72
00:04:56,389 --> 00:05:00,740
encyclopedia project called the younger
daddy n which was a compilation of all

73
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,280
knowledge in the world and it was in
eleven thousand volumes

74
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:10,010
I think actually 11,000 95 is the
current estimate and I say the current

75
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:13,550
estimate because only a fraction of it
we think about 3% of it still survives

76
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:18,229
and we have 24 of the original 11,000
not volumes in the British Library

77
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:24,139
this is one of them but this wasn't a
kind of simple process you can trace it

78
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:28,610
through a bit and say okay so writing on
bones was a bit inconvenient writing on

79
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:34,099
a scroll was better but still not ideal
and then we got to the book and then

80
00:05:34,099 --> 00:05:39,110
everything is ok because the Codex form
of book this kind of book with bound

81
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:44,360
edge and covers on it didn't take off
everywhere and it isn't still today the

82
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,789
only kind of book that people use

83
00:05:46,789 --> 00:05:50,840
it's not as a simple progression to some
kind of ideal idea of what the book is

84
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:55,669
scrolls in do it for a long time so not
everything ends up looking at this

85
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:00,680
some things still look like this these
are Hebrew scrolls and one that giant

86
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,849
someone that's tiny

87
00:06:01,849 --> 00:06:05,330
because I think there's something about
the scale of these objects it's really

88
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:09,109
important you know if you're reading the
Torah which is what both these images

89
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,010
are sometimes you want a big school
sometimes you want a tiny one we're

90
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,670
actually

91
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,030
probably you didn't enroll that tiny
scroll to read it was about carrying it

92
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:18,289
around with you

93
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:22,400
and so that again I'm sort of saying
people and book so what's important here

94
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,500
not just books themselves but they're
quite impractical both of these giant

95
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,760
scroll tiny scroll

96
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,140
they're not very easy to to use
sometimes and in some cultures

97
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,580
there's been attempts to solve this
problem by having these folding books so

98
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,700
they kind of concertina and there's a
picture of one on the screen here which

99
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,159
is MLA manuscript

100
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,840
so from Southeast Asia and it's a Sufi
poem and you can see it's a really

101
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,840
beautiful artifact it's got these
characters on it

102
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,609
the picture at the bottom right of the
screen is this some kind of mystical

103
00:06:55,610 --> 00:07:00,440
characters on the covers of this
concertina book and it's really amazing

104
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:03,260
artifact as well as containing text

105
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,990
there's something about this that these
pictures don't really do justice to

106
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:09,650
because there's more to it than just the
characters on the page

107
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,909
this is a book that's more than just a
thing that carries words it's got power

108
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:19,250
as an object as well and it makes you
think also about how people read books

109
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:24,200
you know how do you read this very thin
pieces strung together

110
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:29,840
it's also a book this is a subtle but
quran from West Africa and it's called a

111
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:32,989
saddlebag quran because more or less if
we can see the bag

112
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:37,730
it's loose leaves of a book and you can
be riding along in the desert in west

113
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:42,320
africa on your camel and pull out just a
single page to read and this is very

114
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:48,200
typical of West African manuscripts of
the time so you thinking okay that's

115
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,460
reading on a camel

116
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:53,000
we've got reading giant scrolls coming
up with all sorts of different ways

117
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,650
people interact with books

118
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:58,940
there's reading as an individual
practice like the top on the left here

119
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,010
having a moment with a book or reading
as a social practice there's a teacher

120
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,659
and the student on the right

121
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:09,650
reading a book together and you can see
the books on the book stand in between

122
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:13,880
them so there's something about the way
people interact with books that's

123
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:15,289
important

124
00:08:15,289 --> 00:08:20,180
and you might read aloud you might read
silently i love how both these guys on

125
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:26,330
the writer kind of pondering with their
fingers on my chin and this is more

126
00:08:26,330 --> 00:08:30,770
reading for pleasure there's this is a
sort of seen in a in a kind of beautiful

127
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:36,049
environment with lots of people reading
and writing and it's actually a school

128
00:08:36,049 --> 00:08:39,978
we think but it looks like a pretty nice
kind of school pretty Ledyard kind of

129
00:08:39,979 --> 00:08:45,380
school writing though isn't only about
kind of learning and teaching it can be

130
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:51,199
powerful and this is a Senegalese amulet
writer and their writing and then the

131
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:55,399
words have power and the words on these
writing boards and these amulets have

132
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:59,870
power even if they're washed off so you
watch the ink off and drink the ink and

133
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:00,800
they have power

134
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,339
so that's getting quite a long way from
anything that we might today understand

135
00:09:04,339 --> 00:09:09,920
as a book when we think about what we
pull off a shelf in a bookshop and books

136
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:14,329
obviously don't have very many words in
them sometimes but we're pretty happy to

137
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:19,189
call them books still this is a Burmese
manuscript about Palace life and it's

138
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:22,550
illustrated with all these elephants and
things and it's in some ways a lot like

139
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:26,689
a contemporary graphic novel because
several elements of the story are

140
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:28,069
together in one picture

141
00:09:28,069 --> 00:09:33,740
there's multiple parts of the story in
one image and the same things true of

142
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:38,029
this next picture show you which is part
of an illustrated ramayana just one of

143
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:42,800
the great epic stories of South Asia and
if you look in the middle into the left

144
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,670
there's a ten-headed demon called
ravanar and he's there in two places not

145
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:50,149
because there's two of him but because
again it's combining elements of the

146
00:09:50,149 --> 00:09:54,829
story you read this like a story like a
book like text

147
00:09:54,829 --> 00:09:57,420
except you read it from the image

148
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,469
and it's not only the sort of visual
elements of books that take us well

149
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,680
beyond any idea of the book is just
carrying text

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:11,400
this book is a fairly plain thing but
it's a devotional manuscript and part of

151
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,150
the devotion around it meant it had to
be treated with smoke every time it was

152
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:19,230
red and that means today in the British
Library when we opened the Box it's in

153
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:23,580
there is a great stench of smoke fills
the room and we've had all sorts of

154
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,570
discussions about how to preserve that
and how to preserve that smell because

155
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:32,430
it's part of the book itself it's part
of the experience of the book and you

156
00:10:32,430 --> 00:10:36,329
wouldn't get that if you just sort of
took a picture of it and read it as a

157
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:39,330
digitized copy so

158
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:44,220
coming back to where I started from if
there's this connection between the way

159
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:47,820
people write and think and the way
people use books and the kind of forms

160
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:50,279
books have and the places they have in
their lives

161
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:53,730
we perhaps need to think a bit more
broadly about books when we're trying to

162
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:55,620
think about their digital future

163
00:10:55,620 --> 00:11:00,600
I mean the kindle is great it reflects
the the Codex you get a page you turn

164
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,290
pages

165
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:05,250
it's very much based on that codex
format but it really misses something

166
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:09,600
when you think very broadly about this
trip booked as i like to and it misses

167
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,390
something when you think about the
diversity of languages and cultures in

168
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,199
the world

169
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,890
this is a map that's the major language
groups of the world and i love it

170
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,490
because it gets away from national
boundaries and it it shows you the

171
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:24,390
written cultures of the world and most
of these written cultures either don't

172
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:29,520
have a tradition of books or they do but
its distinctive and at the moment things

173
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:33,210
like this actually are only the European
tradition put into a slightly different

174
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:36,750
physical format they're not very
different and I'd argue they're

175
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:42,390
replicating a lot of what's gone before
rather than innovating so we've got this

176
00:11:42,390 --> 00:11:48,270
sort of rather single track thing rather
move from one format to another and then

177
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:52,980
replicating the correct format in things
like candles but books are more

178
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,540
complicated than that

179
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,540
and I want to just finish with an
example that really brings that home for

180
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:03,810
me which is an art piece by a guy called
michael mann debug and he wanted to

181
00:12:03,810 --> 00:12:07,199
comment on big data and I think he was
trying to do something really

182
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,120
interesting because his point was if you
want people to understand an enormous

183
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,529
amount of information

184
00:12:13,529 --> 00:12:16,800
the best way to get them to do that is
to get to think about it as volumes

185
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,479
because the analogy of the encyclopedia
and multiple volumes gets a sense of

186
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:26,430
scale and see was inspired by the idea
of the end of print and the idea of the

187
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:31,319
end of the book and wikipedia somehow
represented as volumes both made the

188
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,730
amount of it comprehensible but also
signaled its link to the end of print

189
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:41,820
so he made this out work with a number
of the volumes actually printed out and

190
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:44,910
made wallpaper for the walls of the
gallery was showing the spines of all

191
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:47,969
the others and it's a visually
impressive piece and I think the idea

192
00:12:47,970 --> 00:12:49,680
behind it is really interesting

193
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,069
but remember I told you about that
Chinese encyclopedia from 500 years ago

194
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:56,340
that was eleven thousand ninety five
volumes

195
00:12:56,340 --> 00:13:01,440
well this one printing out the whole of
wikipedia would be 7470 three volumes

196
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:06,120
so there's a sense in which we're not
even back to the scale of ambition that

197
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,170
people had in other places and other
times and actually there are more

198
00:13:10,170 --> 00:13:14,250
connections between the way the future
information looks like going and things

199
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:18,210
that have already gone before but also
opportunities that aren't anywhere in

200
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:21,420
the history of the book like if we can
think even more broadly about what

201
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:25,530
what words do what and how people engage
with information we can do something

202
00:13:25,530 --> 00:13:30,180
more innovative than just replicating
books in digital form we can find ways

203
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,260
to digitize items which aren't important
only because of the words on the page

204
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,550
but believe they smell or their tiny or
their enormous or they need to be read

205
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:43,380
socially and try and create some of
these experiences around digital objects

206
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:47,400
so that we can really get that sense of
what this I think is like what this

207
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,630
object is like as well as what words it
has in it and that's the kind of thing

208
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:55,200
librarians get excited about we don't we
don't worry about whether books going to

209
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,340
be a paperback or an e-book and at the
British Library were already archiving

210
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:04,650
the internet so we're not scared of big
data but we are interested in people and

211
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:09,420
the books and how they will continue to
engage with this and i have a feeling

212
00:14:10,050 --> 00:14:13,229
libraries and books will be around for a
very long time to come

213
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:20,870
but they might just look very different
in 50 years time thank you

214
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:23,870
yeah

215
00:14:24,610 --> 00:14:31,029
so I just need to check how much time i
just took to do that

216
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:37,930
all right ok that was really short so
this time for questions if anybody's got

217
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,649
any

218
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,649
is this working

219
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:45,790
is this morning

220
00:14:50,889 --> 00:14:56,949
I you said about going back to shake his
fellow that anyone can pick it up and

221
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:59,019
know how to use it

222
00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:03,850
how does that work in the age of sort of
digital media where a few you a future

223
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:08,350
civilization comes across a hard disk
was like how do they start decoding that

224
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:15,459
kind of so you need to worry about kind
of the loss of long-term access to work

225
00:15:15,459 --> 00:15:19,599
yeah we do librarians are really worried
about digital preservation because it's

226
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,739
not only about legacy video you know
finding a floppy disk or finding

227
00:15:23,739 --> 00:15:27,339
something that you try to extract it's
also about somehow replicating the

228
00:15:27,339 --> 00:15:31,209
experience of viewing it because if you
can get a document that was I don't know

229
00:15:31,209 --> 00:15:36,219
created in WordPerfect one something
gloriously vintage and you can convert

230
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:40,419
it so that it displays it might look
very very different on the screen than

231
00:15:40,419 --> 00:15:44,379
it did on the original computer it was
first written on and so there's a lot of

232
00:15:44,379 --> 00:15:48,220
work going on around emulation to try
and make sure people sort of don't only

233
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:51,910
have the content but have the accepting
of the experience of looking at it and

234
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:57,519
working with it and digital preservation
also we do a lot of work with around and

235
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,259
making sure what we've digitized stays
and what we've got is digital content

236
00:16:02,259 --> 00:16:06,070
stays and the good example there is the
web archive where

237
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:10,120
the British Library I think most of you
are aware of the internet archive in the

238
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,740
United States but the British Library
Archives by legal deposit so we have the

239
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:19,330
legal right to scrape up the UK internet
which means for example when a political

240
00:16:19,330 --> 00:16:22,150
party changes its policies and wipes his
website

241
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:25,810
we've got it and they can't make us
diluted whereas they can make the

242
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:29,229
internet archive delete it and we're
quite proud of that but that also means

243
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:32,590
we've got a huge responsibility to make
sure that that is preserved because if

244
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:37,060
we have the only copy because say a
political party has tried to delete that

245
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,319
from the record

246
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,400
we've got to make sure it survives and
so there's huge work going on - to do

247
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:45,939
that to replicate it and in fact thing
with the web archive is in

248
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,600
I think six different locations across
the country so that if something

249
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,950
happened to London

250
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,060
it's still there it's distributed
nationally and we did some studies on

251
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:58,660
old links in the web archive and found
that within a year or two ten percent

252
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:02,560
don't work anymore so that's the other
element of this is trying to collect all

253
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:06,669
of that while it's still there so that
we can understand how information

254
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:10,270
changes online so it's not a static kind
of archiving but it's about

255
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,319
understanding how this is changed by
people and how it decays

256
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,270
it's part of the interesting thing about
it

257
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:23,220
yeah

258
00:17:24,790 --> 00:17:25,920
okay well

259
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,350
yeah

260
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:30,500
well you know where to find me if you do
have questions if you want to no doubt

261
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,929
about libraries or about first aid

262
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,120
you can find me in the first a tent and
and i will encourage you all to look at

263
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:42,559
the British Library webpage where you
can see lots of digitized items and

264
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,678
there's a blog for the Asian African
department has almost all of these

265
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:46,760
objects i showed you

266
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:50,570
so you can find more there and that's me
on twitter in case you want to get out

267
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,200
of me

268
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,070
thank you
