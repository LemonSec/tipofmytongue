1
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:14,570
morning welcome to stage see

2
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,730
before we start

3
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:18,939
i would like to remind you to run by
volunteers and we need more volunteers

4
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,400
most notably to run the to operate the
camera and audio system but you are all

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,038
kind of things that we still need people
to take shift for so yeah you should

6
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,360
really go to volunteer at the MF came to
work but for now I will leave you with

7
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:38,769
Caroline drama for was going to talk to
you about open source

8
00:00:38,769 --> 00:00:46,480
hello

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,629
first thing she says i am not a
technology person i am not even a

10
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:52,059
technology lawyer and a corporate lawyer

11
00:00:52,059 --> 00:00:57,309
I'm speaking to you about is that
derived that arise from from open source

12
00:00:57,309 --> 00:01:02,230
software and legal ownership and
licensing talking a little bit about the

13
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:06,460
the history of the development of events
on how it has come to the the kind of

14
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:09,399
legal status that is that now and
looking at the future and how to put it

15
00:01:09,399 --> 00:01:13,390
on a more sustainable fishing so I think
we have some quite and major issues

16
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,250
about how sustainable open source is in
a in a the current environment where he

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:19,240
is being developed

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:22,750
free of charge of my people which isn't
really a model that can that can operate

19
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:27,700
long-term my first encounter that this
is actually relatively recently because

20
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:32,289
I being a corporate lawyer I haven't had
the kind of involvement as that an idea

21
00:01:32,289 --> 00:01:36,670
and IP lawyer would have in this world
but i was contacted by a client and i'll

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:40,869
talk about in a bit more detail about
that later just a few years ago who they

23
00:01:40,869 --> 00:01:44,950
had issues with the ownership of their
offices product which they had been

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:48,670
developing for many years in a row
fairly sort of benign environment

25
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,119
whether just been kind of developing it
during the day as part of their everyday

26
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:56,679
job and changes in their employment
environment meant that was now becoming

27
00:01:56,679 --> 00:02:00,429
more challenging and they wanted to
protect the open source nature of the

28
00:02:00,429 --> 00:02:03,759
software that they had developed
themselves over many years and so what

29
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:06,429
we did was at the house i'll discuss
that in a little bit more detail later

30
00:02:06,429 --> 00:02:13,810
on and we established a more sustainable
ownership structure to pray that that

31
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:14,980
I'm

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:20,768
see ya ok so just for anybody who isn't
familiar with the waiting but the

33
00:02:20,769 --> 00:02:26,860
software is on a legal basis and it is
software which is licensed to think it's

34
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:30,760
very commonly assumed that that because
something is open source it's just out

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,829
there and available but there is a
license that axiomatic to the whole the

36
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:41,079
whole structure the license is always on
certain terms it is license-free hence

37
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:45,280
the that the that the open nature of it
and and it's on terms that grab certain

38
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:50,349
freedoms to the licensee what those
freedoms are though a difference in my

39
00:02:50,349 --> 00:02:51,760
notes and apologize for this

40
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,470
what those terms are i'll talk a little
bit more about some of the main licenses

41
00:02:56,470 --> 00:03:00,220
that are available at the moment that
people commonly used in open source but

42
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:04,030
it is important to realize that this is
that when you use open source software

43
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,209
you're using it on the terms of illegal
License a legal contract

44
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:12,730
it's increasingly an important feature
of the software landscape and there are

45
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:18,760
other the nearly all companies now large
groups and companies are using some open

46
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:19,870
source in there

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:25,540
the IT environment that poses challenges
of its own those that there is a lot of

48
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:28,298
people would argue that it's not being
managed very strategically in those

49
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:31,419
organizations because it's not being
paid for and not going to go through a

50
00:03:31,419 --> 00:03:35,919
procurement process it may be being seen
as more of a truthful with in IT

51
00:03:35,919 --> 00:03:43,030
departments and development departments
within and as I mentioned there are a

52
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,829
variety of Licensing structures that are
available i will talk about some of

53
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:49,209
those in a bit more detail

54
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:56,919
so it has become increasingly important
in the commercial environment number of

55
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,400
reasons for that obviously a lot of
technological change now that we have

56
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,269
moles of software injured architecture
now that we've got more cloud based

57
00:04:04,269 --> 00:04:08,799
internet is always the contrasting help
kid

58
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,560
thank you and see what I've written to
London

59
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,450
look back and obviously the play and
proliferation of different platforms

60
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:20,190
different hardware platforms have made
and the open source software much more

61
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:23,490
relevant in the in the technological
space

62
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,889
the economic environment since 2008 has
also meant that in order to achieve this

63
00:04:28,889 --> 00:04:33,630
and competitive advantage people are
looking for lower cost basis for that to

64
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,860
their development projects

65
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:40,710
it's also regarded as as more you can
innovate more quickly often open source

66
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:44,310
platform and and there is more
collaboration possible in certain areas

67
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:50,190
which is seen as is key in the economic
environment now and the changing

68
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:57,240
strategic approach of of large users the
flexibility and they're they're shorter

69
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,750
development times are seen as critical
to just getting projects off the ground

70
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,229
so there's a has been a huge change in
the way it's being used

71
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,720
ok

72
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:16,830
so talk about the free software
foundation founded in nineteen

73
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,789
eighty-five by richard stallman and this
was the beginning of the philosophy of

74
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:26,700
open source and he was an academic at
MIT he was being required to operate to

75
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,940
anything that he developed was was going
on commercial licenses and he was very

76
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:35,010
unhappy with the way that was that was
operating any left MIT and set up the

77
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:38,760
Free Software Foundation to oversee the
gnu project the development of the

78
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:43,650
operating system and which ones he
became the game linux the kernel of

79
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,669
linux up gnu i love that it actually
stands for recursive acronym stands for

80
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:54,030
gnu is not unix and this was an attempt
attempt to undermine the unix dominance

81
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,809
in the market for freedoms were
different with those which he considered

82
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:05,190
to be in a key to what open source is
the the right to run the software for

83
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,270
any purpose commercially all otherwise
and anything you want to do to access

84
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,140
and fairly adept source code to
redistribute to anyone but that's the

85
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,669
the interesting part I think what which
is stormin was trying to do you are able

86
00:06:17,670 --> 00:06:24,210
to redistribute the software to anyone
you had to adapt it and derive even

87
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:27,180
product from it but when you do so this
is that one

88
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,040
this is the restrictive licensing model
when you do so you are obliged to

89
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,650
license whatever you'd arrived on the
same turns so you can't take this at the

90
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:41,640
free software and essentially use it for
commercial purposes I'm going to read a

91
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,479
little bit from the the gnu manifesto
and the Free Software Foundation

92
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:49,680
manifesto which richard stallman device
because i think that this kind of

93
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,040
reflects the philosophical underpinning
of the whole movement

94
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,120
it has many things are changing
underneath this now but i think this is

95
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,110
this is useful

96
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,490
richard stallman said I consider it the
golden rule requires that if I like a

97
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,370
program i must share it with other
people who like it

98
00:07:05,370 --> 00:07:08,730
software sounds want to divide the users
and conquer them making each user agree

99
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:09,990
not to share with others

100
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,770
I refuse to break solidarity with other
users in this way I cannot in good

101
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,979
conscience sign a nondisclosure
agreement or software license agreement

102
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:20,310
so that I can continue to use computers
without dishonor

103
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,190
I have decided to put together a
sufficient body of free software so that

104
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,490
I will be able to get along

105
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,300
without any software that is not free
once jenny was written everyone will be

106
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:31,630
able to obtain good system software free
just like air

107
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,270
this means much more than saving
everyone the price of the unit slices

108
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,880
that means that much wasteful
duplication of system programming effort

109
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,630
will be avoided this effort can go
instead into advancing the state of the

110
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:45,039
art extracting money from users of a
program by restricting the use of it is

111
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:48,520
destructive because the restrictions
reduce the amount of the ways that the

112
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,870
program can be used

113
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,710
this reduces the amount of wealth that
humanity derives from the program when

114
00:07:53,710 --> 00:07:56,948
there was a deliberate choice to
restrict the harmful consequences are

115
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,419
deliberate destruction

116
00:07:58,419 --> 00:08:04,240
he seems very philosophical very
ideological and a bit hippyish really a

117
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,349
bit of it

118
00:08:05,349 --> 00:08:10,599
call me and it was felt by the late
nineties as the ideal at that sort of

119
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:15,130
ideological approach was receding it
began to be felt that that was getting

120
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:21,280
in the way of the wider adoption of open
source and open source initiative was

121
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,020
set up in the late nineties with their
own definition and this essentially on

122
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,979
the slide are the the 10 components of
the definition of open source software

123
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,229
for these purposes

124
00:08:32,229 --> 00:08:38,140
I think that perhaps the most
interesting aspect of this is that there

125
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,979
is that the authors of deriving work can
retain the source code and that you have

126
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:45,070
a freedom to distribute derived works on
any terms you like

127
00:08:45,579 --> 00:08:51,609
so in contrast to the gnu and and and
the licenses on that model you are and

128
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:53,800
you're allowed to make money off the
inside

129
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:00,370
in essence and so to come to that we now
are dealing with a variety of licensing

130
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,079
models that operate in parallel

131
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:08,739
first the restrictive or copyleft
approach this is the that in the model

132
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:13,240
of the journey license this is the the
idea that whatever you derive from the

133
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:18,850
open source software you must license
that on the same terms so that it

134
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:24,459
carries on being a fully open source
product the GPL the general public

135
00:09:24,459 --> 00:09:30,880
license is the the kind of core example
of this only thirty-six percent market

136
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,439
share now in 2010

137
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:35,770
the GPL represented sixty-four percent
of open source software and now it's in

138
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:36,829
her sixties massive

139
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:43,190
in decline as a as a model of the
licensing the permissive license has

140
00:09:43,190 --> 00:09:48,350
it's very much in the ascendant the MIT
license is now accounts for twenty-six

141
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,290
percent of the code license in open
source and 2010 that was only four

142
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,189
percent

143
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,590
similarly the Apache License sixteen
percent now only four percent 2010 and

144
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,700
another that those are the BSD licenses
accounts for about six percent my

145
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:05,450
personal favorite and less than one
percent of the market but the do what

146
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,450
the fuck you want to public license I
think that's a great name and it pretty

147
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,830
much sums up what it's all about

148
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,150
this is the trend and we're going
towards a permissive license social

149
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,069
personally because I'm attracted to the
the free for all model

150
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:22,370
I think it's a shame that we're going
that way but if it means that and that

151
00:10:22,370 --> 00:10:27,680
the the whole concept of open source is
getting more getting more traction

152
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:34,459
then I guess the surprise worth paying I
want to a little bit because as i am not

153
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:40,850
a technology geek but I am a legal geek
and i'm very interested in the way the

154
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:45,770
GPL work i find it very subversive model
of Licensing it takes

155
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:50,270
what we normally expect intellectual
property law to be doing and turns it on

156
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:54,800
its head and turns it to the advantage
of the licensee we think about

157
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:00,469
intellectual property law as protecting
the intellectual rights of the Creator

158
00:11:00,470 --> 00:11:04,220
often referred to as creators right
that's what we tend to assume it's there

159
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:11,450
to do and what the GPL does is say that
the if you use what you have received

160
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:14,390
under this license what you're entitled
to use under this license

161
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:20,510
you must license it back on the same
terms it it perpetuates an open a type

162
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:25,160
of intellectual property ownership and
international property licensing when I

163
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,300
say though that we we start from the
point of view of thinking of

164
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,870
intellectual property laws protecting of
somebody's rights of inter enabling them

165
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:38,930
to benefit financially usually from
their own intellectual work in fact was

166
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:42,349
that is true if you go back to the
original reasons for the patent system

167
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,950
which is the first of that the
intellectual property models to get

168
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,620
developed you go back and and

169
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:52,000
look at where that comes from the
purpose of patent law originally was not

170
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,690
to protect people's ownership because
people were doing that through secrecy

171
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:58,930
it was actually to achieve openness it
was too

172
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:03,579
you got the protection of the law only
if you published the technology that you

173
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:08,380
had developed the idea was that it
massively speeded up the progress of

174
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:14,529
technological development by making
prior inventions accessible and readable

175
00:12:14,529 --> 00:12:17,860
to the public to people who might
develop them

176
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:23,860
it moved it forward and in that sense
the GPL is actually rather similar to

177
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:28,420
that approach it takes what what has
been achieved and says develop it

178
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,900
but publisher it just doesn't give
people the commercial protection and

179
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:36,790
i'll come on - why I think that's an
issue and as I say use the inverse what

180
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:39,819
we usually think of is the purpose of
the of the law

181
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:43,150
I also has a legal get find the DPL
quite exciting because it's got no

182
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,560
governing law as it doesn't say it's
governed by english law or New York lord

183
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,959
LOL or just silent on the subject

184
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,270
so you go back to first principles you
have to go okay who is making the

185
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:57,160
contract with whom in what state it's
there for you it can be interpreted

186
00:12:57,160 --> 00:13:00,339
differently under different legal
systems so that's great

187
00:13:00,339 --> 00:13:03,820
in the in certain environments in French
than the French courts it's a real

188
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:10,390
problem because French the French legal
system massively prioritizes creators

189
00:13:10,390 --> 00:13:14,680
rights and intellectual property rights
as a personal asset and so the GPL is

190
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:24,910
very difficult to operate in France key
terms of the GPL actually an irrevocable

191
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:30,940
so once you've granted the license you
can't pull it back if you granted you is

192
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,750
you just software under the GPL there's
no kind of pulling it back in and

193
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:38,980
relicensing it on a different basis it's
out there and you can't revoke it

194
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:44,709
you have complete freedom as a licensed
under the GPL to do whatever you like

195
00:13:44,709 --> 00:13:49,239
with the software but as soon as you
distribute or convey the software to

196
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,350
anybody else

197
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:55,209
whether that's as itself or are they as
part of a derived products that you've

198
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:59,709
created at that point and you are
restricted in what you can do you are as

199
00:13:59,709 --> 00:14:02,800
I've said before obliged to license it
on the same terms

200
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:10,720
any breach of the license so if you
purport to distribute the software and

201
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:16,810
don't do so under the GPL revokes your
rights under the license that you the

202
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:20,680
benefit of your benefiting from but
that's really am

203
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,910
tricky as well because what happens if
you have licensed something that

204
00:14:24,910 --> 00:14:28,810
comprises that the software that you're
the beneficiary of you on license it to

205
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,829
somebody else

206
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,699
what happens then if your license is
revoked then you have nothing to license

207
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,540
yourself

208
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:40,300
so the license is specific on that also
all downstream licensing is included in

209
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,670
the original license so it's a
completely flat structure there's no

210
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:46,569
license and sublicense and sublicense
it's just everybody benefits from the

211
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:50,290
original software under the original
license that it sent out in even if that

212
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:53,290
now is part of a drive product

213
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,870
the apache license is a little different
is that this is more this is a

214
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,209
permissive license that you can do what
you like

215
00:15:02,209 --> 00:15:06,229
so once again perpetual and irrevocable
but in this case it from its

216
00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,970
reproduction and the distribution of all
there is no software and derivative

217
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:13,879
works and you can charge for that you
can do that on any terms you like you're

218
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:17,480
not obliged to replicate the terms of
the license under which you benefit

219
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,740
there are conditions relating to
attribution so that you can do what you

220
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,970
like with that you're not allowed to
claim that you created it and derivative

221
00:15:25,970 --> 00:15:35,990
works you can see you on any terms you
like essentially the MIT license has

222
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:39,170
four paragraphs in its all on one page
and essentially it says you can do

223
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:42,529
anything you like but the authors
attribution rights are protected and

224
00:15:42,529 --> 00:15:51,139
that's probably all it does very very
short for license so looking at

225
00:15:51,139 --> 00:15:56,689
whichever model of open source your
operating the original creator of the

226
00:15:56,689 --> 00:16:02,059
the software and we we've got to start
looking i think now that I'm massively

227
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:06,500
attracted philosophically to the idea
that that software is out there it's a

228
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,610
public good

229
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:11,209
you know a force for good in the world
as they on my slide I'm very attracted

230
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,680
to that idea

231
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,120
I'm very frustrated my part of Richard
storm is a public i didn't read images

232
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,459
Richard Simmons SF manifesto where he
says surely software developers have a

233
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:26,689
right to be rewarded for their work and
he goes well you don't have to be a

234
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:32,300
software developer which I just think is
an absolutely ridiculous approach to do

235
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,849
these things you know everybody has the
right to be rewarded for their work we

236
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:39,290
have somehow to have everyone has to eat
everyone has to pay the bills we somehow

237
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,939
have to set up as a structure for open
source software that is achievable

238
00:16:44,449 --> 00:16:47,660
come on to talk about different ways we
might do that

239
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:51,180
there's a it

240
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,620
we are looking at the whole dichotomy is
IP law is the very existence of

241
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,310
Licensing and copywriting and the church
property rights in general is this a

242
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:03,270
force for protectionism for me to
protect the the value of my intellectual

243
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:06,810
work or is it a force for progress in
the world for developing the state of

244
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:07,829
the art quickly

245
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:15,359
there's an interesting question about
who owns the IP in a large product

246
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:19,139
that's been developed by many developers
in the nature of open source measure of

247
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:23,190
most if you're employed by an
organization to develop software for the

248
00:17:23,190 --> 00:17:26,490
organization than anything you
developing your job becomes your

249
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:27,630
employers property

250
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:31,080
typically it's in your employment
contract normally on the other hand if

251
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,750
you're developing something as part of a
community of developers for a large open

252
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:37,800
source project

253
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:42,030
what happens who owns it but where what
is the nature of the intellectual

254
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,620
property in the ownership of it

255
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,219
that might not seem massively important
because I'll see it's being licensed

256
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:51,450
open it was really matter but her then
forces the license if the person who is

257
00:17:51,450 --> 00:17:54,540
entitled to enforce intellectual
property rights is the owner of the

258
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:58,020
intellectual property rights if you've
got a product that's got 300 or three

259
00:17:58,020 --> 00:18:01,650
thousand different developers all who
have different bits of ownership within

260
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:04,290
it enforcement's an absolute nightmare
they could be in all sorts of different

261
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:09,060
countries that said the GPL isn't a
jurisdiction specific so you could be

262
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:12,240
trying to enforce across many countries

263
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:15,540
it just is that it's unsustainable is
impossible

264
00:18:15,540 --> 00:18:21,240
so a lot of open source projects include
a development agreement where the each

265
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,660
developer in the developers community
assigns the intellectual property in

266
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:30,360
their work to the the the broader hole
so that it's all in one place in in

267
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:33,360
ownership terms

268
00:18:34,290 --> 00:18:39,659
so don't start specifically about the
linux foundation because this is one of

269
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,460
the most sustainable models

270
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:44,700
it was any founded in two thousand was
the nexus between being developed for

271
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:50,310
quite some time before that and it has
expanded its remit now it doesn't just

272
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:53,639
isn't just focused on the development of
X itself it's trying to create the

273
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,940
largest share technology investment in
history as its mission statement

274
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:01,740
it's not just developing linux it's
looking to be the main focus for any

275
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,580
number of open source projects cloud
project Internet of Things project is

276
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:10,860
hosting various projects that are the
been initiated by other people so it's

277
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:14,070
been really tryin to two broad matches
its reach

278
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:18,810
but within the just looking at the
development of linux in the way that has

279
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:23,280
gone there is a developer's community
people many of you may have even been

280
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,460
involved in that people who are
developing code and contributing it back

281
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,110
under the GPL two minutes

282
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:33,300
they also have a little time

283
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,860
no paid staff and they therefore have to
fund that and so there are you can

284
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:41,250
become a companies typically can become
financial members of the Linux

285
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:47,070
Foundation and there are various tiers
of membership and to be a member

286
00:19:47,670 --> 00:19:52,410
vent visor benefits such as the ability
to kind of define what the next step and

287
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:57,090
the next development steps should be for
linux so the costs of it can be anything

288
00:19:57,090 --> 00:20:02,879
from a half a million u.s. dollars a
year down to 5,000 u.s. dollars a year

289
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,940
and other sort of prices for the
different tiers of membership but you

290
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,540
think about a large organization and
paying for windows licenses instead of

291
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,340
using linux

292
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,580
you know you're really talking about a
massive saving that these companies

293
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,960
these big organizations have a huge
interest in making sure that Linux is up

294
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:25,230
to date and carries on working the linux
foundation is set up as an Oregon State

295
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:27,870
nonprofit mutual benefit corporation

296
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:32,520
I've looked in great detail at its
various constitutional documentation it

297
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,100
has these various classes of membership

298
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,360
it also has affiliates who are not
financial members but our corporates and

299
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,330
but who contribute in a non-financial
way typically by hand

300
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:48,100
the condom or deploying some of their
stuff for some of their working time to

301
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:51,100
get towards the next project

302
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:56,020
I'm talking about

303
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,990
openfoam which is a client of mine and
said my my initiation into the world of

304
00:21:01,990 --> 00:21:06,130
open source came late and came through
corporate law not through intellectual

305
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:11,530
property law and it came through this is
a free open phone they are the people

306
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:16,240
who did they developed and a fluid flow
modeling software which is used a lot in

307
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,600
the automotive sector but in various
other sectors to medically indeed

308
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:26,530
and it's that it was licensed on an open
source model was under the GPL the

309
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:32,860
company that developed it was very happy
for it to be open source isn't they were

310
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,179
in by an American company

311
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:37,510
the key developers in the company

312
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:40,629
we're doing a lot of the work of those
for open source that were doing it in as

313
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:41,590
part of their day job

314
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:48,220
it was all very benign and then the
ownership changed and the new owners

315
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,450
were not happy for the developers to
work on company time and they were not

316
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,550
happy for that

317
00:21:54,550 --> 00:21:58,720
that they were essentially looking for
ways they could take the software back

318
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,460
the software and make it into a
commercial product rather than an open

319
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:07,030
source product and the developers who
had been involved in this from the start

320
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:08,350
was very unhappy with that

321
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,439
so they came to me and asked if we could
do something to get into a sustainable

322
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:17,530
footing so we looked in a lot of detail
at linux at genivi mozilla Apache

323
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:23,350
various different models for the hood
the owning this sort of product then

324
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:26,770
realized as we looked around there was
absolutely nothing in the UK that I

325
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,830
could not find and i did a huge amount
of deep digging on this and looked at

326
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:33,639
many many UK owned open source software
products

327
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:37,660
none of them were owned on anything
approaching the the linux mobile

328
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,770
anything like it

329
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:42,730
typically what we were seeing was that
they were owned by a one shareholder one

330
00:22:42,730 --> 00:22:49,450
share company licensed under the GPL or
another open source license but not

331
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:53,290
owned in a way that would prevent or
would you give some kind of long-term

332
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:55,260
security and I might

333
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:59,070
ok if it's one person developing a small
product for themselves you know which

334
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:02,460
they provide a license until they decide
not to anymore that that might be again

335
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:05,520
I'm sure it is but it might be if what
you've got is a huge developers

336
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,220
community hours of social developers
community and people are did are

337
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,220
donating their time and their creativity

338
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:16,050
the idea that the rug could be pulled
from under them the idea that could just

339
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,909
be forked and turned into a commercial
product by the person who owns the the

340
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:24,270
underlying copyright i think is
seriously problematic in a developer's

341
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:28,230
community and this is where I'm at with
when I'm talking about sustainable open

342
00:23:28,230 --> 00:23:33,060
source ownership this is the thing that
I think is is really keep and so the

343
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:40,919
idea that there's nothing about in the
UK and so various issues with the one

344
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,030
shoulder one share model uses community
also as you know if you're using a piece

345
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,620
of software in your business

346
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:50,189
the idea that could just suddenly
stopped getting maintain stop getting

347
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:53,040
them move forward is obviously a huge is
he

348
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:58,560
so if we try to get open source more
fully embedded in the corporate world

349
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:04,290
then that that's not that's not going to
work either so we looked at what we

350
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:05,730
could do instead

351
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:11,400
in the UK looking at the NEX in
particular we don't have a structure

352
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:14,940
English company law anything likely that
that the nonprofit and for-profit

353
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,190
company corporation that they had in
Oregon but we said we would create

354
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:23,520
something as close as we could at the
company vehicles that we have we looked

355
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,060
at Community Interest companies which is
a fairly new structure essentially

356
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:30,570
designed for the ownership of village
halls did already

357
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,379
it wasn't going to do it for us so we
set up a company limited by guarantee

358
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:38,280
there's nothing to stop a company
limited by guarantee from distributing

359
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,430
its profits other than its own
constitutional rules but it's typically

360
00:24:41,430 --> 00:24:44,640
used in not-for-profit type
organizations

361
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,330
it's also very difficult to just sell
the company limited by guarantee that

362
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:51,810
the transfer of ownership is more
complicated and more involved

363
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,710
we designed the constitutional documents
extremely carefully we had a set of

364
00:24:55,710 --> 00:25:00,000
articles which dealt with the the way in
which the thing would be owned in the

365
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,750
way in which corporate governance would
operate setting out the the board

366
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,020
technical committee

367
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:09,700
we also have a set of rules which could
be changed by the board which is a

368
00:25:09,700 --> 00:25:13,510
little bit sort of light attached which
established the qualifications that

369
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:17,560
members have to have to have and what
kind of things are going to be paid this

370
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,659
what things can be changed

371
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,520
we set it up with a model of financial
membership so that any organizations

372
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:28,990
that were using the software could elect
to contribute financially and as I said

373
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:32,380
they have an interest in that they want
to see that the software maintained

374
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:37,060
developed so it's not on the one hand
secured a procurement departments will

375
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,399
look at it and say well why are we
paying for something we can have four

376
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:39,910
three

377
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:43,180
but there is a an argument that can be
made and it can be justified

378
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:48,520
we then had contributing members who are
people typically individuals who are

379
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,700
actually developing the software and
contributing in their intellectual

380
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:58,750
assets and it was licensed under the
under the GPL with a compass or a

381
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:03,220
contribution agreement which as i said
as i mentioned before it's very typical

382
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:09,010
for the contributors to the license the
edited a sign that the benefit of their

383
00:26:09,010 --> 00:26:12,010
intellectual property rights and that
was done

384
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:19,380
and the DPL to ensure that we had the
most restrictive license so that any

385
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:22,380
develop products could not be bought

386
00:26:26,830 --> 00:26:31,480
and having done this just as far as i
know it's the only one still in the UK

387
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,590
and that's on the sort of basis but i do
think that it represents a possibility

388
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:39,428
for a new paradigm for a new way of
thinking about open source so that stops

389
00:26:39,429 --> 00:26:43,299
being something that people who have
been the development community are

390
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,080
essentially contributing to as a kind of
charity project

391
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,699
it starts to actually be something that
that is sustainable and potentially

392
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:57,880
remunerated to solving the economic
conundrum that how do we reward

393
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,389
developers for the work that they're
doing in a internet environment where

394
00:27:01,389 --> 00:27:05,678
nobody is paying the membership model
seems to offer grabs the best approach

395
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:11,139
for that and hopefully creating a a
genuinely open structure

396
00:27:11,139 --> 00:27:15,820
I don't generally open ownership and
sustainable for a threat insertion in

397
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:18,820
the future

398
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,668
I hope that's one

399
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,700
that's me if anyone wants to talk about
this stuff we've been told that we can

400
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:34,670
we can take questions of these talks if
there's a little bit of time I think

401
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:38,000
there's a few minutes and we can i
contact with questions but i'll be

402
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,950
around the festival until tomorrow

403
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:45,680
yeah wait wait for the mic

404
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:52,280
okay thanks to talk really interesting
on the membership side but about to back

405
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,090
with the info model when you mentioned
members were you talking about members

406
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:58,820
and the companies that kind of thing for
voting rights and stuff like that or

407
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:03,050
just general associate members you play
and I don't have anything else and they

408
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:08,480
were well the thing about County company
is that instead of being a shit remember

409
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,900
that we typically think of members and
shareholders this anonymous but a

410
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,930
guarantee company doesn't share so it
doesn't have shareholders a guarantee a

411
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:19,370
member of a guarantee company is a
agrees to guarantee the liabilities of

412
00:28:19,370 --> 00:28:21,320
the company up to a certain threshold

413
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:27,110
what we did we didn't create that kind
of membership in the case of open firm

414
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,280
we that they they were members in a
contractual sense so that we had a

415
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,040
membership agreement and they just they
have certain rights they have certain

416
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:40,280
and committee attendance rights and so
they can dictate or influence that the

417
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,040
future direction that the software takes

418
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,350
so did that

419
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:50,820
one last question and then speed but
you're going to need to take it out

420
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:05,860
so what are the you know from the point
of view of setting out a legal structure

421
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:11,439
like this in a community that may not
presently have any kind of funding

422
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,679
how do you how did the open phone
foundation overcome their okay well in

423
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:21,039
the case of open firms I say it's it's
it's fluid flow modeling that the

424
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:26,649
software doesn't it does it in a variety
of different context that's a medically

425
00:29:26,649 --> 00:29:31,090
it seems like that they can actually
model how injecting a liquid into a

426
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:35,199
brain tumor will have a liquid flow
through brain cells but equally it

427
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:42,070
models how air flows around but need a
particular shape of car so it's very the

428
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:49,000
blood number of the automotive sector
customers as a user's and those users

429
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:54,100
were invited to two to join to become
members and bite that because their

430
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:57,129
membership entitles them to influence
the direction that the software

431
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:02,049
development takes and because the
alternative is to buy a commercial

432
00:30:02,049 --> 00:30:04,840
license in for up for another product
which will be considerably more

433
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:11,830
expensive number of their users were
willing to participate in that way but

434
00:30:11,830 --> 00:30:17,769
of course you do you know linux is is a
similar model people join cup

435
00:30:17,769 --> 00:30:21,220
corporations join a in order to
influence the direction and in order to

436
