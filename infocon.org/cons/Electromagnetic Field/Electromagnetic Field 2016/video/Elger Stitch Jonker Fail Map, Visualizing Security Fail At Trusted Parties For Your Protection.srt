1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,030
ok

2
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,219
that

3
00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:17,680
thank you

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,680
during this talk my name is stitch
alcohol yoker i'm from the netherlands

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,400
as you might have spotted and if you
think your heart

6
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,720
well this is terrible wearing stage so I
have a small presentation a really short

7
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,010
presentation about film app or file card

8
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:44,080
it's a dutch translation arm and i hope
you can see it on the projector

9
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:51,040
you see a map of the netherlands which
is grayed out and we're going to color

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,180
that map today

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:59,230
so my question was with our it within
our government is information security

12
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:06,550
taken seriously arm and instead of doing
a really short sighted investigation and

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,030
shout and have some short media
attention

14
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:16,600
I thought we should answer the question
with some facts so numbers and that's

15
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:22,690
what I did so I with couple with a
couple of friends we made this nice

16
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:28,509
proof of concept so we took the local
touch government's municipalities we

17
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:33,850
create a map find supplements of this
municipality and then do a simple TLS

18
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:37,658
and SL scan on them and call on the map

19
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:42,070
if you are up if you announce that at
the right moment you might have an

20
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:44,529
impact and this is what happened

21
00:01:44,530 --> 00:01:52,210
so the colored map was presented on a
conference with only security officers

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,240
of municipalities and that's fun

23
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,530
we have 200 people there that instantly
are terrified

24
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:05,079
that's good so on march 19 this year

25
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:11,220
you see the map on the left with the
Unites rats areas are

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,930
three days later the map was much much
more dream

27
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:23,070
in fact we saw Oh about 150 security
issues just over the weekend by

28
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:26,070
announcing it and that's fun

29
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:32,700
we coded this like in a few days and we
are

30
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,820
yeah it was by accident that we get all
got the opportunity to talk about to

31
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:46,650
those people so arm today only one
percent of the secure connections is

32
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:47,730
terrible

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,290
it used to be eight percent and the
amount of the mains is steadily growing

34
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:56,010
arm and it continues to lower so that's
good

35
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:01,590
now this works excellent array but we
can do a little bit more

36
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:05,459
so why did this work then

37
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,970
first off it's somewhat negative its
feel map you feel if your read on the

38
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:17,730
map and are so many other municipalities
that are green and you don't want to be

39
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:23,070
the one that stands out so you want to
put in some effort and type in apt-get

40
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:30,450
upgrade its continuous and it's not
voluntarily

41
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,090
so I we we are basically forcing
security scans upon the municipalities

42
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:39,390
whether they like it or not some got
angry

43
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:46,109
some loved it so we will stick with the
ones that love it and they are the role

44
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:53,100
models that we also got the Security
office like broadcasting like oh no

45
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,359
we're having a minute

46
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,130
having another media accident and we
will have to work to four in the morning

47
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,320
and some of us to have some of them did

48
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,530
so yes

49
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:06,650
so the next thing is the world

50
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:12,079
we have a small country the Netherlands
but they're so much more crap out there

51
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:15,049
we can also this arm

52
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:21,350
the plan is to do any government
anywhere with any legal test especially

53
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:28,160
the any legal test is highly dubious but
we will figure out a way that everybody

54
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,310
will benefit from this plan

55
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:38,840
so what we did is start a new foundation
it was called the internet clean of

56
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:40,400
foundation

57
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,400
it was started the day before this game
started

58
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,989
so that was nice and and not nice
scheduling

59
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:52,430
we've got a team of eight volunteers for
the netherlands to run the sides and to

60
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,750
make it faster

61
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:59,930
- because terribly slow right now but to
make it faster to make sure that in the

62
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,750
ends every one

63
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:09,650
even your a your computer inept person
can just run this check spite of

64
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:13,940
themselves and verified on their own
that the government is doing a good job

65
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:15,380
or not

66
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:18,770
so we got some funds for it

67
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:22,039
we basically have a project for one year

68
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:27,020
so we have some continuity which is
awesome because this district about 40

69
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:32,448
hours of work each week while having a
full-time job and it will kill you so we

70
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:36,380
now have some funds to make this our job

71
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,159
it's fun so it's actually the government
paying us to throw the government

72
00:05:40,669 --> 00:05:50,659
good so our goals are to in the nettles
have 6,000 security failures fixed in

73
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:53,620
this year in Europe

74
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:58,990
well six sixty sixty thousand and in
England and the rest of the world

75
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:07,300
600,000 so that will be a lot of work
and it will be a lot of fun because we

76
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,090
automate everything

77
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:14,500
um so what - what does this project
deliver

78
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:19,720
well the thousands of security
improvements source code repository

79
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:26,650
which is already there you can always
already get clothing the project on it

80
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:30,669
the instructions for running your own
will be there are there will be a

81
00:06:30,669 --> 00:06:38,198
foundation that has unlimited google ads
so yay and large sets with data so all

82
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:42,880
scans we do will be published and you
can use it for your own do some data

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,270
mining on its so the non tangibles are
that the government can be trusted

84
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:55,270
a little bit every time a little bit
more in doing their jobs properly so

85
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:57,159
great arm

86
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,960
it's also an enabler in a neighbor
neighbor for the security business

87
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,650
because if the government's think this
is important

88
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:10,479
some businesses might also think this is
important and they are also trained to

89
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,219
handle security incidents

90
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,120
so if we find something that is actually
terrible

91
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:21,430
we will not disclose it will do the
standard responsible disclosure known by

92
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:28,330
many and about well they can learn to
handle that it will be fun

93
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:31,330
more work till four in the morning

94
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:39,969
so our next steps are we are setting up
a team we have a foundation now we set

95
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:44,020
up a team that has meetings every two
weeks so it's pretty boring stuff but we

96
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,020
it's like you need to get an engine
running and we need to see what's the

97
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:52,609
optimum way to spend the funds

98
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:57,169
and well we will we want to migrate to
open street maps because we had

99
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,849
something in just a few hours that looks
like a map of the Netherlands but really

100
00:08:01,849 --> 00:08:02,539
isn't

101
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:09,979
and we have to add more checks so not
only for TLS with us for a DNS SEC and

102
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:17,659
4d came and SPF and all the other stuff
insecure cookies and you name it

103
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:25,699
everything you can scan in like half a
second with with zero knowledge we we

104
00:08:25,699 --> 00:08:32,300
are going to automate so the conclusion
was this actually works and we need it

105
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:38,208
and i only have a simple question is I
know England where is your precious

106
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,189
information stored

107
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:45,680
we need to know because we need to know
what to scan and that's an honest

108
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,359
question and i would like to ask you
where is your personally identifiable

109
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:56,750
information stored what companies and
would you be willing to help this

110
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,360
project and the rollout to England

111
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,360
so that's an honest question

112
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:16,300
God . to UK

113
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:26,920
it has everything I hear a lot of
remarks

114
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:32,349
isn't it so that in England the personal
information is stored with companies

115
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:38,199
that you can like a digital fault or
something here we have equifax which has

116
00:09:38,199 --> 00:09:42,309
got all of our financial details
everything tighter everyone and their in

117
00:09:42,309 --> 00:09:48,519
Scotland there's free of these companies
and call credit and something

118
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:52,360
Experian and they have information on
every single person

119
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,360
everything excellent

120
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:03,610
so there's another question I have a
question

121
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,269
well there's quite a large cache copy in
the big room in children

122
00:10:12,879 --> 00:10:23,679
ok of everything everything and it's in
a sort of ownership building close eh q

123
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:26,319
yeah I know that ignore the building
yeah

124
00:10:26,319 --> 00:10:34,748
machine it anybody else I think we've
given up are seekers this question

125
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:45,300
I'm just trying to find the relevant
legal close

126
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:48,750
I can't provide any information because
I'm a foreigner and in the light of

127
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,960
blank cds i'm getting deported anytime
soon

128
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:57,510
so basically all you're browsing day for
recall correctly is stored in your

129
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:02,819
internet provider for a year and its
axis of evil by them

130
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:11,040
our law enforcement in any case so so we
should check that nobody

131
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,689
so there are regulations that already
exists we're not here to defend them but

132
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:23,100
we can at least verify that there's no
obvious leaked in those providers so

133
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,760
that means that the government get the
data but nobody else

134
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:36,180
well I don't know what that means but i
cannot hear you sorry

135
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:42,959
there's a mic on the way the decision
lies with the government or what they

136
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,260
don't we don't know yet because as I
said it's thought of your internet

137
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:51,060
provider which is a private company so
we don't know how safe is a browsing

138
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:56,520
history at the end of the day so they
might one day sell its to let's say big

139
00:11:56,520 --> 00:12:01,590
corporation with sell sandwiches and
because i googled eggs guest today some

140
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:08,010
you know my mailbox get said you know
crammed with sandwich advertisements

141
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:11,520
we don't know which end is always ready
- announcer

142
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:15,870
well we can get an answer for that so
thanks

143
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:22,410
well that's basically basically are . Oh
a couple of other places where they

144
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:26,670
started to be Companies House the land
registry in the Charities Commission

145
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:33,939
store information on all those things
and attended really good

146
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:37,029
I didn't really get to question but i
will listen I will talk to you later

147
00:12:37,659 --> 00:12:40,659
please so arm

148
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:44,979
so if anyone wants to waste some time
and scared the shit out of people and

149
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:46,509
make them really nervous

150
