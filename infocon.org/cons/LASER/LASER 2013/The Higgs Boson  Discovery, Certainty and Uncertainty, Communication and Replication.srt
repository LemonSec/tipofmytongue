1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,330
I thank you very much and everyone heard

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,799
for manicured when it might actually
netday interesting opportunity act

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,300
%uh already at that time so i cant send

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:15,530
how we think about problems and so on
and so forth

5
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,740
actually and a lot discussions yesterday

6
00:00:18,740 --> 00:00:22,509
lightning I'm so I I units necmettin

7
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:26,660
you I'm trying to articulate not only

8
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:29,820
you know way I you as a particle excess

9
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:33,590
by all what I'll what website

10
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,960
use and how we do it and outlet are

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,690
what they say details ready you broader
discussions

12
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,190
and how sir knowledge

13
00:00:45,190 --> 00:00:49,468
unit so make that many

14
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:53,170
also just stay day hand

15
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:57,789
I had applied for the London Stock on
there will not be a test on any

16
00:00:57,789 --> 00:01:02,309
that and Halfpenny point critics a
realist rate if you can

17
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:06,548
and most important part but I'll please
just reinsurer

18
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:10,250
mean anything actually talk more lax
about me

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:14,260
very happy state within the allotted
time

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,400
take are whatever's interest you but I
view it

21
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,970
duties over to start it but I

22
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,679
get methodology more chores job sup

23
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,070
I'm actually has an introductory slides

24
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,070
and I you a written for me Empire

25
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:35,758
a 3sum at any that are I know ransdell

26
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,790
so let's start with the Academy

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,320
so last me I'll ballclub and

28
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,470
your case wind no price

29
00:01:45,470 --> 00:01:48,929
for I'm inventing be

30
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,990
a snack and sandwich explains a lot of
an athlete

31
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:56,469
what we call a standard model are
objects witches are now completely

32
00:01:56,469 --> 00:01:59,548
just latest and greatest understanding
of that

33
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,280
fundamental articles nature on battered
ap

34
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,790
never been ok so

35
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,179
a half rating description here yeah

36
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,060
day theoretical discovery its mechanism
that with this guy

37
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:17,900
forgetting taxes than I discovered by

38
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:21,340
yeah it's in CNS experiments at the
Large Hadron Collider

39
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:25,440
I work for this 1i East work but that
one here's a picture

40
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,730
many of my colleagues certain what you
know about crack spread

41
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:33,319
gastric band certain that ATS good

42
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,190
for we're pleased to see that reject
recognized in this is back

43
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,709
at all for you by get gates

44
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:46,819
States that were price for its own

45
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,109
sup on we see a stroke before

46
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,349
I incredibly relevant thinking about

47
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:57,099
cool sides an answer right there are
known knowns

48
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,129
I know its and I'm down

49
00:03:00,129 --> 00:03:03,549
yes I don't know known unknowns I'm not
yet

50
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:06,599
right we have yet 83 after he

51
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:11,140
I uncertainties that we model right and
build models not home

52
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,529
up thanks for trying that's right miles
to be answered

53
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:17,550
a half ago it how we do that

54
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,940
but and mr. beans day

55
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,409
we don't know yet and day

56
00:03:24,409 --> 00:03:28,709
that creates problems and that's what
we'll get you wrong answers science it's

57
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,680
artists I

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,970
mechanisms for what you do when you have
problems

59
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:40,659
Mike that have discussed this issue so
let's start with what we have on

60
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:44,040
this is a very brief survey standard
model

61
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:47,069
are business there worse

62
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:51,480
that you put together that you buy next
month an anecdote of neutrons

63
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,609
which it most and nasty everyday matter

64
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,720
yeah that's a half HR its electrons

65
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,970
that's all chemistry are a and it turns
out

66
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:05,620
a runner for all these different I

67
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:09,140
that courtroom at times there are two
more generations

68
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:14,349
air carriers the helmet down and then
there are healthy very forces over

69
00:04:14,349 --> 00:04:14,720
getting

70
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,529
I'll and you the info call

71
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:22,650
love to chat each other as I didn't
explain I'm

72
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:26,880
sell less look at one you can ask about
articles

73
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,860
heavy heart how much master their sup

74
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:36,169
ap electron have a massive 500+
cholesterols

75
00:04:36,169 --> 00:04:40,370
and what you need to know about that
really is nasa proton

76
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,669
or pit lane apt by drinking at is a
little less than 1

77
00:04:44,669 --> 00:04:48,219
acting at Electrabel so that's just what
you should treat

78
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,740
scale rather than worrying about down

79
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:54,900
you know how what the definition
Electrabel

80
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:59,198
it's very thankful at not really what's
important I'm

81
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,100
so tummy and at 1.78 g/t

82
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,800
%eh yeah a very heavy electron at their
different number that's

83
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,289
by now it's about three been hacked
orders an act you get my own

84
00:05:13,289 --> 00:05:16,789
wi-fi Horace Mann you may go up there -4

85
00:05:16,789 --> 00:05:20,509
back to nature electron volts hey it's

86
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:23,539
173 get your laptop what's

87
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:27,430
and however or scary articles W

88
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,009
the and folk iron

89
00:05:32,009 --> 00:05:35,150
and when you look at least numbers

90
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,929
after I billion all numbers on this page
I'm

91
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,930
you lease the there are you know what

92
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,070
articles the comment about that's the
max

93
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:49,630
you know with the state hair 20 percent
except BW and its

94
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,530
so the way it is just like today and I'm

95
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:58,130
it happens to be true in this case is
something is going on with the Wnt

96
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,800
ever make their nest are the same town

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,169
so let's start with that how it turns
out that photons also involves

98
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,740
and it brings us to what the price
morning for

99
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:15,229
that problem magnetic 7 it seems to be
what we're calling it these days

100
00:06:15,229 --> 00:06:19,860
professor route would also have won the
Nobel Prize last week

101
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,090
at outcast way use on

102
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,690
sup where to park on taxes come from

103
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:32,819
she said that he wanted a very unhappy
slides cell phone

104
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:36,490
in the standard model you have fact
formalism

105
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:40,610
all that lol Raj immigration from which
you can extract to be here

106
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:43,819
articles and PA's and the first thing
I'd like to point out is that

107
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:47,340
are involves its fields on

108
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,150
anywhere gannett be is gonna be the
discovery pages

109
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:54,229
%uh it's hot starts out quite simple

110
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:57,979
you have might be statements act you
have it

111
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:03,349
and during the year day a interactions
with a particular symmetry

112
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:06,539
that mean creating a draw like that and
a potential

113
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:10,030
SB and when you expand the hour

114
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:13,359
UK I adlai a

115
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,500
reflects day particular century

116
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,259
bet it's going to turn YouTube but be
wunc

117
00:07:20,259 --> 00:07:23,780
so down hand the moment at

118
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:28,340
you actually I meant so what can we say
about this

119
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:33,190
rather a symmetry in between that mean
that the boat out here

120
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,229
but that imagery doesn't exist in nature

121
00:07:36,229 --> 00:07:40,419
first ball articles are not allowed to
happen next in early prime

122
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,770
a it a senator dole's that we bill its
own

123
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:48,609
and second of all ok time is now less
and I W it the right way

124
00:07:48,610 --> 00:07:54,470
at so if there were an ass turning
liberace would look something

125
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:57,680
by an axe I the elsewhere

126
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,819
which I just read mister slick nappy
cake

127
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:04,030
yes and we both played out I'll

128
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:07,508
you actually yet tyrants that looked
like

129
00:08:07,509 --> 00:08:10,819
%um literally squared here's XW here

130
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:14,090
by here net all you really need to know
5

131
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:17,359
where did not respect so at

132
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,870
when ACS actually

133
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,590
is an interaction between to take days

134
00:08:24,590 --> 00:08:29,229
and chewed up step 4 point ratchet that
could be Friday

135
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,909
hate when it does you bouncing off each
other artwork you take is going into

136
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:34,468
doubt he's going out

137
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:38,080
so on and so on as long

138
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,890
ads yes HBO is an ordinary

139
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:45,029
that's what just right either

140
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:48,830
date field is not an hour K

141
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:51,970
sup if for some reason

142
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:54,990
estate feel instead up

143
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,430
be the eurozone face that is the which
is true

144
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:02,410
rather archtop thank you there's no
electron somewhere that value

145
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,480
the electric field is the right there
and WM they died

146
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,330
W Europe but for some reason it hits at

147
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:13,399
I know I'm here about added that the
next a shootout you

148
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:16,870
then when there wasn't a other anywhere
eight-term

149
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:20,450
yes winter needs you the square W where

150
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:24,910
which looks like an act like beer and
master

151
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,469
so it arises going up on the right side

152
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:31,820
because me at this potential makes

153
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:35,320
a strictly looks like a what we call a
taxi

154
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:38,670
impact right here I'll is right in the
middle here

155
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,339
but not the limo Excel and what away
potential

156
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:46,720
work in general net banking updates if
the system had some

157
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:50,120
energetic sense dictate mennonite so

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,339
at the universal I be

159
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:57,320
potential with minimized any actors
flexibility for what direction

160
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:00,720
thanks minimized a she did not hold you

161
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,920
espy is a multicomponent vector

162
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,529
not really that single number so

163
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:11,000
that wine is okay s direction

164
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,560
arbitrator what's text it makes the W's

165
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:17,619
and he and ok different from each other

166
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:21,170
and the photon is massless just happens
to be

167
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:24,709
yeltsin direction good it doesn't get
any mass

168
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:29,479
have he's getting ass poignant this
interaction

169
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:32,829
but Ian St a it's the US its value

170
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,670
said basically they don't even easier
bouncing off base

171
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:40,069
all the time he needed space

172
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:43,430
yeah I think about it word that picture

173
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:46,430
free space that's silhouette

174
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:49,969
even picture is cheating but the
illustration

175
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:53,120
up so I away it's dry here the

176
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:56,860
actually real and imaginary components
up up by

177
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:02,339
and back each day tape asymmetry group
corresponds to actions on a

178
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:04,000
two-component better but which

179
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,260
it's a complex numbers sorry help keep
thinking about the coordinates the

180
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:09,399
upgrade but

181
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:12,700
appointees up and down is that value
this potential

182
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:16,230
around is just that choice up where

183
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:20,360
potential universe must stay year

184
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,149
at and not be actually we describe the
prisoners

185
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:28,010
because we had a secretary or before and
that we broke it

186
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:31,300
and the phone companies just the name of
the particle

187
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:34,349
nasa's acts

188
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:38,600
so on I meet rescue people at the very
end if this

189
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,230
isn't much more I way you can't stay

190
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:46,570
well maybe only other particles also
backed up you you can just yet then

191
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:51,589
not sorted these each symmetry breaking
attracting the dates don't just simple

192
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:55,910
the okay of attractive its on

193
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:59,779
and especially important point that
relates to what that makes things we can

194
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:00,350
learn about

195
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:03,870
a stock which is OK so what are we
getting out at

196
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:07,670
fish NAT Nat on Ash that just getting
your yesterday

197
00:12:07,670 --> 00:12:11,130
photons are massless okay we are you
that for a long time

198
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:14,180
for that much more importantly

199
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:17,290
WNC fund assets related

200
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:20,560
strain beatnik their course in
particular mix

201
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,630
so all these measurements people already
know about once this mechanism with

202
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:25,570
invented

203
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:28,920
you can predict the Wnt mask and a ratio

204
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:33,550
before they were backed so when they
don't even see where found it's earned

205
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,510
the nineteen eighties

206
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:38,980
we already had confirmation something
like that mechanism with their

207
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:43,510
but had masses enright every piece
together

208
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:46,700
iron so if this mechanism at

209
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:49,910
a because I'm everything is predicted
but x-mas

210
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:53,149
just lemme spent a long time looking for
it date

211
00:12:53,149 --> 00:12:57,060
and it's free me said oh wait must not
be too bad right to look for it

212
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:00,149
mats accelerator and reach

213
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:03,410
and getting repeat how

214
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:06,569
kilby we figured out we were finally

215
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:10,070
the last one the everywhere Mitch are
displaced

216
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:13,470
about upgrade Sony buzz on

217
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:18,120
also responsible not for me on assets
then we know it ask you what

218
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:22,060
couples probably to when heavy fermions

219
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:25,689
and not so much what firms show

220
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,300
a slight more that mean so the point

221
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:34,500
WD were discovered in the eighties there
in top court was discovered at Fermilab

222
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:39,339
in the nineties Hadley the standard
model a separate gates

223
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,380
so you can already yes he is ready to
get well

224
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,420
just missing mackie's and find its

225
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:49,479
he and Matt 2012 on

226
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,610
so the instrument change your speeches
by

227
00:13:52,610 --> 00:13:56,490
yes yeah see I'll so I ended up here

228
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,570
this is the airport at work over here
and you see that picture

229
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:04,120
they trade your G yes there's great and
there's that

230
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:07,230
the outs and so on and so forth I'll

231
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,779
and bass 27 kilometers morning

232
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,050
runs under I'll Swiss and French
quarters about a hundred meters

233
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:15,599
underground

234
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,190
iron and there are eight points that I
point that's now you

235
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:24,860
where it could be relations about 45
objectives

236
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:28,370
let's but but the fact up now I'll

237
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:32,139
so every seconds eat at the LHC cross

238
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:36,149
30 million times you too 40 forty yeah
it hurts me gene

239
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:40,600
and some day spots are empty for various
technical reasons

240
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,370
but okay because the well

241
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:47,800
ET's are so bench with protons

242
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:51,569
you getting any collision in stock
leading to make you happy to twenty or

243
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:52,230
thirty

244
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:55,589
were someday we're gonna go up to 140

245
00:14:55,589 --> 00:14:59,120
because our goal is really to learn as
much as we can as quickly as we can and

246
00:14:59,120 --> 00:14:59,949
also to make

247
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:03,170
like art any graduate students we're
dealing with ada

248
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,740
has more importantly said

249
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,800
a yeah so I don't the me

250
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:12,829
basically we have overtimes at

251
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:17,989
you know 40 E her time in the past
instead maybe in the future

252
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,290
and thanks carey should be and sea spray

253
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,769
ally them together and you have a whole
lot you can't believe it's available for

254
00:15:25,769 --> 00:15:27,529
making your articles

255
00:15:27,529 --> 00:15:31,550
hand you may also want a new part and he
just wanted to address

256
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:34,670
but it happens you running a the
nation's

257
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,399
I billion seconds for a couple years

258
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,790
we had given the were rare on

259
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:47,870
so I was captivated Adam

260
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:51,019
I how many ATT any %uh

261
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,699
age it you know research or ever been
produced

262
00:15:54,699 --> 00:15:57,719
yell see I got Adam

263
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:01,259
I 400 thats over a years

264
00:16:01,259 --> 00:16:04,399
add you here

265
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,639
billion crossing the second we had I

266
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:11,350
about you ten billion second three-year
meeting which is that

267
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:15,360
there to be here I'm terms a
24-hour-a-day

268
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:19,579
right so you get its very very rare

269
00:16:19,579 --> 00:16:22,790
huge

270
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,790
so we're also iron

271
00:16:25,790 --> 00:16:29,480
we had a nice two major experiments that
are you cannot see and

272
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,509
acts that are general-purpose scrapped
say really are trying to get a handle on

273
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:36,600
everything ERATION iron

274
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,050
and be reached or a about a good night

275
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:44,359
second data which is are less that
doesn't mean we have

276
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:47,970
one later date at a replacement
ratatouille

277
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:52,380
that we have starting the hardware and
eventually beat real time software

278
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,430
farms tools for identifying sorry and

279
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:59,109
my one for look at we only store its

280
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:03,070
restoring a few hundred need output
second

281
00:17:03,070 --> 00:17:06,110
and take a about it I'm making each

282
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:11,958
get so up here's one of the instruments
that you feel that information point at

283
00:17:11,959 --> 00:17:13,230
the RMC

284
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:16,319
and you have people here scales and as
one-party

285
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:19,859
after being install I a smaller

286
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:23,990
that you cannot purvis actors I weighing
in on the

287
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:27,299
50 meters high but also the end here at
fault that

288
00:17:27,299 --> 00:17:30,559
times I that actually

289
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,020
bill around a very large magnetic field
is used for tracking charged particles

290
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:39,929
culture at that moment I'm it really is

291
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:43,210
its tournament onion up %uh technologies

292
00:17:43,210 --> 00:17:46,850
excited are which articles my where

293
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:51,350
by I'll utilizing the amazing which
different articles

294
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:55,240
detract or you can pick a side

295
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,490
at get you can be helped but that

296
00:17:58,490 --> 00:18:01,640
ok with staying touch %uh case

297
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,850
a few thousand yes I'm and maybe

298
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:10,250
thousand engineers and technicians there
he's currently working on the project

299
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:14,809
I at you 100 the he University class

300
00:18:14,809 --> 00:18:18,178
in 42 countries which the United States

301
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:21,370
great marketing trick backed

302
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:25,850
on so that's pretty big business

303
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:30,049
and on what its distinctive on

304
00:18:30,049 --> 00:18:33,629
well years now which as an actor

305
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,030
where I demonstrated I ever made

306
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:40,139
you actions demonstrate really

307
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:45,419
how different particles behave good so
inside a giant magnetic field sectors

308
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:49,900
track articles that are charged are
hurting its magnetic field

309
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:53,059
and they are any the fairly sparse
layers

310
00:18:53,059 --> 00:18:58,080
7 actors active U-boats and from these
points you connect the dots

311
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:01,699
you see the curvature article and the

312
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,690
a more energy article as the message
gets hurt by this jacket

313
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:10,309
so you can measure energy one-way back

314
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:13,399
now some particles I'm

315
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,840
called veterans get stops in this

316
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,080
be wait now all the hadronic calorimeter

317
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:23,870
here really nature's energy by absorbing
all

318
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:27,549
and then seeing how much and he actually
turned into molecular

319
00:19:27,549 --> 00:19:31,160
expectations and outlawed brats

320
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,710
on and I'm you once day

321
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,850
her one-way magnetic field here and then

322
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,049
when the magnetic field returns back the
other way

323
00:19:41,049 --> 00:19:44,700
the lines deeply feature back the other
way

324
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,990
and their special detective not here to
be with actually more tracking

325
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:54,110
nuance every other yachts that no other
article acts like down

326
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,918
so wet by a stately following always
partners

327
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,549
they're also usual articles like
photocopies nothing tracker

328
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:05,408
and all the energy gets left right at
the front that the calorimeter

329
00:20:05,409 --> 00:20:08,570
copycats %uh particular attractions
other

330
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:12,500
bond so by putting together the signals
in the actors

331
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:17,480
we can see what articles are coming out
which on

332
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,049
so here's a particular had

333
00:20:21,049 --> 00:20:24,530
you see a lot of stuff here day is
probably

334
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:28,730
catches the eye pictures they put out if
the particles are or

335
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:31,780
I know they're or their current a lot

336
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:35,889
any they don't have much energy this is
this is crap that comes

337
00:20:35,890 --> 00:20:39,429
out a proton proton collisions I

338
00:20:39,429 --> 00:20:42,940
my my fighter that the rest I'm

339
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,940
used to call the pro I mean cards out
retro times are made

340
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,330
reporters and their full update blue
arms and

341
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:53,399
works that are by AT&T works together
inner

342
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,610
Libyan had in at a distance of it so
when you have an exciting

343
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,809
elation you're really blowing sky are

344
00:21:00,809 --> 00:21:04,129
have you got a lot of detritus hacks

345
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,620
its useful but it's not dangerous back

346
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,439
interesting a huge deposits
electromagnetic flowmeter

347
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:15,039
here other this is consistent

348
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:19,600
mitigates the change you facts on

349
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,379
our next flight I'll we have to a
different perspective this is not

350
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:24,720
looking

351
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,630
and offices trying to select it so I you
can see in particular

352
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:32,570
boring stuff is mostly going trackback

353
00:21:32,570 --> 00:21:35,639
I along the LHCb essentially

354
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,659
first and a taste of is more

355
00:21:38,659 --> 00:21:41,890
extractor if he go in any direction

356
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:46,650
so and be much of the time it does this
matter which is where we can detect

357
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:51,659
best an escalation there are two you
once

358
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,090
they interpret as coming from the boat
on

359
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,908
and whoever Jackson astronauts it could
be from

360
00:21:58,909 --> 00:22:04,059
its so at when they hate speech case to
works

361
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:08,330
you have to deal with acted worse don't
black bike and steps

362
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:13,299
extremely strongly interacting so she's
actually ports apart from each other

363
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:16,830
a bill more and more Eric works at the
huge energy

364
00:22:16,830 --> 00:22:20,199
build-up until you get state articles
again

365
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:24,340
as a result you outgoing works econ Jets
up

366
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:28,539
235 E 10 at Mom's you don't know the
number

367
00:22:28,539 --> 00:22:32,870
but I feel the owns after area

368
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:36,590
up hydronic activity you can start to
keep our

369
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:39,740
guess and we have more yeah ik

370
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:43,299
rubric any comment or is term candid

371
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:47,418
on this previous certainly I'm

372
00:22:47,419 --> 00:22:51,789
at but the actually comment on it when I
get something that illustrate

373
00:22:51,789 --> 00:22:54,929
well in a couple of sites but remind me
if I forget

374
00:22:54,929 --> 00:22:59,830
I guess just like the animation and i
got to tell you but I think but

375
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:02,879
remind me iron

376
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,210
just one more thing about the iron

377
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:09,370
peace trying to get here be cut its

378
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:13,010
they are be force the had promised a

379
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:16,629
PE SLA and actually travel for me

380
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:21,400
to be in the attack so it not only are
we collect a good run

381
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:24,650
yet are gathered here well tracking back

382
00:23:24,650 --> 00:23:28,299
tracks charged at Ron's in it yet

383
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:32,080
and we're seeing they don't come a place
there s an English

384
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,389
and it's another in our talk it's very
important

385
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:38,490
as it gets get going pay preferentially

386
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:42,669
be towards the back at the thanks again
K June

387
00:23:42,669 --> 00:23:47,450
so on what we doing all this day

388
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:51,419
any picture we don't let these pictures
to figure out what's actually going on

389
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:55,640
we really do it neck of a lot of grass
act but for correlations between

390
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:58,590
variables and build up models that are
supported

391
00:23:58,590 --> 00:24:03,860
like what you see so status taken in
real time and stored

392
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,529
we have that was it collaborators so
what we can do it

393
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:11,159
so we have he analyses any spare

394
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:15,809
day are iron put it together tools that

395
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:19,178
do different steps are understanding it
the whole

396
00:24:19,179 --> 00:24:24,309
gonna controls for changing electrical
signals in a calorimeter

397
00:24:24,309 --> 00:24:27,830
extremist you here's a jet the sack on

398
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:31,879
seventies for example or chrome the
other articles yet and I'm all the

399
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,450
comments

400
00:24:33,450 --> 00:24:38,350
and we have procedures for particular
variables we can you to describe the

401
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:39,740
particles

402
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:43,429
up day are consistent with this signal
which he

403
00:24:43,429 --> 00:24:47,610
in this case because it was looking for
in the background which is a collision

404
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,860
thats anything else up

405
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,889
so for example one thing we can do is
that we have

406
00:24:53,890 --> 00:24:57,520
its you vote on their HD two proton
ended

407
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,440
at we can pass if those two boats or
chrome

408
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,590
its what would that he is now acting

409
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:08,610
the it matches up with a sec you're
going to see a pattern

410
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:12,529
at it your listing data plan actually
gonna come back to you

411
00:25:12,529 --> 00:25:15,970
nasa putting two particles together like
that a lot

412
00:25:15,970 --> 00:25:19,840
into stock better that way he does that

413
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:22,850
go or search for

414
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:26,939
each that that's the yeah your
eyewitness

415
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:30,190
yeah he is iron for

416
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:33,980
maybe get a chance the max is absolutely
critical

417
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,250
me that operation other at you per

418
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:40,260
heard met so we

419
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:43,289
act didn't play kids you

420
00:25:43,289 --> 00:25:47,169
wet you human for the massive dates from

421
00:25:47,169 --> 00:25:51,470
do you have some criteria to identify
think EA's

422
00:25:51,470 --> 00:25:55,490
and then you see it yes they show up
especially at some particular

423
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:59,570
its I some somewhat simple show you this
thing

424
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,629
on and

425
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:07,890
so let if we have how much will also for
statistical analysis and bought and

426
00:26:07,890 --> 00:26:10,000
although he thinks and eventually

427
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,490
a be that the attorneys up a chance to
actually sign

428
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,260
by every single person on its parent we
all

429
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:20,658
and I'll talk more about our entropy
patent where

430
00:26:20,659 --> 00:26:23,659
it's worth noting that most of the work
defense is not

431
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:27,990
I doing physics is actually him up
yesterday most of the work that

432
00:26:27,990 --> 00:26:31,980
being is this if he married complex
stayed at

433
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:36,870
thinking about how to slice and dice how
to put all these particles together

434
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:41,529
so that we learn something and I'm and
what's you know how effective that

435
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:44,529
n you right a perfect sense

436
00:26:44,529 --> 00:26:48,240
we asked for a beast accidents with
these particular

437
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:51,510
down objects and I'm and we happened
happy

438
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:56,100
energy to be in that stretch kids and we
observed in our simulation

439
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,379
day that will help us find it's the best
and now

440
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:02,529
years have no to but they a lot of the
work and

441
00:27:02,529 --> 00:27:07,289
exists cory Kennedy Charles & Platt

442
00:27:07,289 --> 00:27:10,830
also we need an awful lot the I'll

443
00:27:10,830 --> 00:27:13,949
so let me have its worldwide great

444
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:16,980
computing infrastructure I'll a

445
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:20,059
story the smallest estimates the speedy

446
00:27:20,059 --> 00:27:23,990
by year iron II computers at all

447
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,799
class and so course we don't download
the data

448
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,639
for individual user and houses first we
have common jobs simplifying data

449
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,289
smaller acts and we send the process
they

450
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:40,129
me personally want to do to where today
its

451
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:45,669
iron so on we have these vary by campus
and you're ready to dance it actually

452
00:27:45,669 --> 00:27:47,440
takes up a lot more space than the real

453
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,880
here I because me very small

454
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:54,980
ethical uncertainty on actually
predictions otherwise you're introducing

455
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:55,659
a complete

456
00:27:55,659 --> 00:27:59,070
flexible air urinalysis yet you just

457
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:02,658
with that one chick always page had bad
luck in your simulation

458
00:28:02,659 --> 00:28:05,919
on so

459
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,899
each simulating event independent and he
process D-day

460
00:28:09,899 --> 00:28:13,168
and you know we have went relation
measure every

461
00:28:13,169 --> 00:28:16,730
me store everything store you profits
that later

462
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:19,940
so let no supercomputing here

463
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,029
these are all just very much farms

464
00:28:23,029 --> 00:28:26,289
running the same software

465
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:29,510
yeah so this whole thing huge huge here

466
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,690
rising or all-out I by a lot

467
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,010
used I good

468
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:40,710
will you say anything about how that got
started

469
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,080
be safe doing well actress this

470
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,580
you certainly good that another way

471
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:51,120
is week but it's actually involves a lot
of other stuff

472
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,799
getaway I was up yesterday morning make

473
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,149
you he was a is affected with over your
favorite

474
00:28:58,149 --> 00:29:01,340
lots of a truck drought ok

475
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:05,379
radii it this is really important I'm

476
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:08,549
yes are that people who think

477
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:12,639
about on what we need to change together

478
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,159
units said people decades ago or

479
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:20,250
I'm say identify bit

480
00:29:20,250 --> 00:29:23,990
a at some point years they had already
celebrated

481
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:28,390
still even finishing back we're gonna be
insufficient for the next round

482
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:31,490
problems axo course a

483
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,159
you know a ran a bunch of stipulations
that what you do with a high-energy

484
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,950
machine

485
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:42,240
I'll black what fish looks like there
any particular

486
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,770
iron yeah me you make the case that

487
00:29:45,770 --> 00:29:48,980
we need to go to this energy to be sure
we can find both

488
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,250
you're somebody think that what they
might look like here I

489
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:55,429
activity with bill you stretch that out
there about playing

490
00:29:55,429 --> 00:29:58,840
I'm starting an almost dead theoretical

491
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:02,449
and then you fill in details right and
technical proposals

492
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:07,500
I'll and you had many many many
engineers unit course

493
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,159
there are very important dates that
businesses tap touch and let the code

494
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:12,020
that

495
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:16,350
and that I'm allowed to run statistical
tools that I haven't personally but the

496
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,439
insider

497
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,570
nobody but you the mechanicals or
Churchwell

498
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:23,710
and actor yet the whole enterprise is
ruined

499
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:27,480
it rolls off somewhere so or engineers

500
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,659
yet so is it police necessarily

501
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:35,100
case dated comes out in spirit specify
I'm one group

502
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:39,260
goes into this comment forwards then
available to everybody

503
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,970
so it the on

504
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:46,200
do it that way this works in are the
only SBC

505
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:50,179
Brady that people who have paid their
dues

506
00:30:50,179 --> 00:30:53,289
in making the detector happen so that
maybe

507
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:58,090
I their a were involved in the
construction for a long time

508
00:30:58,090 --> 00:31:01,449
or an outcome that you can meet its
taxes you know including

509
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:04,610
from or running computing up

510
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:08,090
they are only spare a and

511
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:11,330
a have access to all commentator

512
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:14,879
and a at preempt analyzing way black

513
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,169
at that point mean argument someone
else's group

514
00:31:18,169 --> 00:31:21,250
up later on that you know it's redrawn
previous

515
00:31:21,250 --> 00:31:26,830
inch iron I'll talk later about how we
deal with its where

516
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,529
you know MIT my process that at one way
say we have it

517
00:31:30,529 --> 00:31:33,799
and another group my process the data
slightly different way

518
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:37,039
actually had that and then you had
discussions

519
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,740
and eventually we're gonna come out with
a combined result in

520
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:44,730
its from turn sketch yeah I

521
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,799
well right is a good question

522
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:51,860
I'm so wet her

523
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:56,918
we have shown any in the near term while
we are trying

524
00:31:56,919 --> 00:32:00,220
to let we have a look here: lag he

525
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:03,970
and polite form some practioner market

526
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:07,460
and you imagine by that time be spared
me

527
00:32:07,460 --> 00:32:12,580
is done right when we actually disband
computer not like all the things we call

528
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:13,080
Matt

529
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:16,699
for decades I'll will make it all
available in some way

530
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,630
spawn clearly girl we're a little bit
slow I'm not making India

531
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:24,010
outlay I'll beach cottages

532
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:27,370
first of all we're worried people games
work on it

533
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:32,510
actor I'm are gonna find it very easy to
make quick and dirty actions

534
00:32:32,510 --> 00:32:36,440
you don't spend a lot of time going here
the air is associate my

535
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:41,340
actor you get better results even faster
results and you published yet

536
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:44,949
I'll and that's not good science and
also with me

537
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:48,570
people who have spent decades and
thereby elect him if he

538
00:32:48,570 --> 00:32:53,450
former the analysis they want you not
because I really like building machines

539
00:32:53,450 --> 00:32:54,240
per se

540
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:57,549
a little bit happy it we got superstar

541
00:32:57,549 --> 00:33:01,480
work so we view the experiment at the
fair

542
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:06,820
we you can also view is that between
expand its run every second

543
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:10,519
week keno attack but we delay ads

544
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:14,539
a we started filming yet and we look at
the data first

545
00:33:14,539 --> 00:33:18,779
will tell you what we found and at some
point

546
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,140
and on the off chance missed something
other people on

547
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:29,380
so let me circle around I have more
sociology major

548
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,370
I'll to a but

549
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:37,549
settle at is another story and tough
char

550
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:41,370
here but this is what we have to look at
a lot we started

551
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:46,029
its potential nasa expose our we knew it
we at least

552
00:33:46,029 --> 00:33:50,860
yesterday 90 times for pros ways from
the start yeltsin

553
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:54,269
and going up to the raid possibly up

554
00:33:54,269 --> 00:33:58,779
and i'm looking white freestyle on sell
at

555
00:33:58,779 --> 00:34:01,929
unit chart should be laterite albee's

556
00:34:01,929 --> 00:34:06,210
or up to Luhansk Ahmed outcome of the
case

557
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,730
any between is actually attractions we
where I'll

558
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,780
virtual top and bottom ports be there
other articles that exist temporarily

559
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,409
that facilitate the extraction up

560
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:21,649
it's okay to be produced by itself in
this way or

561
00:34:21,649 --> 00:34:26,500
in the previous up along with two other

562
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,710
reports for example yessir for me
council meeting

563
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:33,109
quarters or along with it up both on

564
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:37,409
or longer to top court's and all the
production rates

565
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:40,730
depend on a contraction into articles
exit

566
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:43,879
and on does particle masses

567
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:47,020
so we could predict obvious and it just
depends also on

568
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,770
eat snacks so at we view this is our
best rate for a production and there are

569
00:34:51,770 --> 00:34:53,009
some others across a good

570
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:57,119
yes all and this line of thought here
the actual mass

571
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:00,750
a return you on

572
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:04,609
so I am combined with the production

573
00:35:04,609 --> 00:35:08,630
we met also had yes I mentioned before
it's like today

574
00:35:08,630 --> 00:35:11,770
%uh courts achanak mere

575
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:14,770
it have enough and a air to as

576
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:19,680
W instead it would much rather do that W
there

577
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,109
so we live in is weird place but it's
mostly

578
00:35:23,109 --> 00:35:27,069
works %uh what's really hard to seek
iron

579
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,950
so you also have to combine eventually

580
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:34,509
what your produce lead to and what he
did AT&T

581
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:38,320
and ask what your detector and actually
evaluate

582
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:41,800
and I certainly don't iron what

583
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:45,349
put you through all the details yes but

584
00:35:45,349 --> 00:35:49,900
88 a spare ok top is actually one of the
most effective channels

585
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:53,550
even though it's a record K be cuts
began a band

586
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:56,869
most common production mechanism AT&T

587
00:35:56,869 --> 00:35:59,970
guidance

588
00:35:59,970 --> 00:36:03,098
there's not so much that looks like

589
00:36:03,099 --> 00:36:07,510
so now let me get back to when it can
thats has to be

590
00:36:07,510 --> 00:36:10,760
signal to noise ratio us

591
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:13,910
%uh so a plot are showing

592
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:18,339
day by day appearances at the dance
after a complex election that's

593
00:36:18,339 --> 00:36:21,450
post it out it bodes I'll

594
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:25,020
adoration max's I said yes is

595
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:29,170
a photo missus masts and what you're
looking at

596
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,710
here with this line is a background only
it to

597
00:36:32,710 --> 00:36:36,200
Bay think that we're going to expose
them what would it look like

598
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:40,480
any ok I'm errors our hotels that are
produced in other ways

599
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,060
or a photo op and most effective way to
model them is to see what's there

600
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,200
any EC heat starting to arise

601
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:52,348
in the middle then you also you it

602
00:36:52,349 --> 00:36:55,380
say no you can see its red line coming
across

603
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:58,829
here in just a moment where

604
00:36:58,829 --> 00:37:02,920
sure there's a lot of backgrounds and
you know what background should be

605
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:07,599
at work with Luongo its right in the
middle here's a book on

606
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:11,300
XP Astra photon parents gonna look

607
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:15,089
my they're gonna be nasty this
particular next

608
00:37:15,089 --> 00:37:18,400
took an idiot wanna be against on the
spot

609
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:22,869
but most of them are not at both ends
it's just we see if US

610
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:26,470
acted it big enough XD it a significant

611
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:31,660
out about that detail now unless I S
black you see another nice

612
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:35,210
a snowy you to see both arms that ban

613
00:37:35,210 --> 00:37:38,430
go to do what some combination of
electron new one

614
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:42,450
there's where Jesse automax a cat

615
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:45,549
and eighty here from this the be

616
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:48,770
here duties and then middle

617
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:52,050
is where you're expecting it right there

618
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:55,800
and you can see low and behold the
standard model predicts this red line

619
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:58,920
and we have in excess there so

620
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:02,440
the other hand I should know is what we
just watched

621
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:07,940
over a minute eggnog developing not be
doomed to join the analysis

622
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:10,970
we need to build the house and

623
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,299
determine what the air is associate get
certainty such say

624
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,609
associate are iron

625
00:38:17,609 --> 00:38:22,328
with out looking at eat lots Realty many
other distributions that are helping us

626
00:38:22,329 --> 00:38:22,790
the

627
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:26,020
estimates in Palo eighty our estimation
techniques

628
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:30,060
and then periodically state for every
major conference

629
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:35,230
we what review all I'm blaming where we
now look at these points

630
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,730
and then you go back and make an
animated gif can demonstrate

631
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:42,359
I'll what you action

632
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,049
what you actually had about on

633
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:49,800
cell phone

634
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:53,460
I actually looking at how we're doing
time

635
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:56,619
Islands get some details here but

636
00:38:56,619 --> 00:39:00,380
I show you the simplest analyses
administration's

637
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:03,880
we also at cases where you have to do
what

638
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:08,140
I'm in both machine learning outcomes to
combine many variables

639
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:11,578
because your masters online one is only
one several and

640
00:39:11,579 --> 00:39:16,030
America so in this particular example
yeah one strategy which is

641
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,030
you put requirements on all the
variables that are helpful

642
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:22,500
mind case and you can ask for and here's
where

643
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:26,599
with me if that you notice that worked
on a

644
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:30,530
and you can see Perak state the day at

645
00:39:30,530 --> 00:39:34,040
and be say no the Asia

646
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:37,470
and this combined prediction which is
stack polyester

647
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:40,689
why is consistent with or without the
red dots

648
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:45,339
basic on and that's exactly what be
published at that point

649
00:39:45,339 --> 00:39:49,049
great on the other side the actors
machine learning how to read

650
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:52,070
producing a number from minus 0.1

651
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:55,619
I'm and yet to get me through it amassed

652
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:00,450
in its master which so issued an
intermediate step

653
00:40:00,450 --> 00:40:04,098
in at the net the analysis day take the
whole 138

654
00:40:04,099 --> 00:40:08,000
what's the info on shit plots that
weekend

655
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,970
thing and you do that you can eventually

656
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:15,379
put all its parts together by Mitch %uh

657
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,930
cases against you the most significant
essentially

658
00:40:18,930 --> 00:40:22,180
must yes and he's the

659
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:25,419
read all eight here now now is there an
excess

660
00:40:25,420 --> 00:40:29,160
well the last few days it looks like
there is in in the very last one

661
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:32,990
is one intense and two would have been
more like yet but

662
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,549
of course we know it you have 18 after
running

663
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:40,690
abusing Billy nation sacking her a
couple years

664
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,950
that one day I'm currently 105

665
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:47,240
best fluctuations we feel

666
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,180
actually don't see it this map it so in
fact we have it

667
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:54,299
armed at all according to our own

668
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:57,880
standard sixty greater that educate

669
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:01,460
and bloodworms and it will be exciting
to confirm that

670
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,829
as he will need we have I hate that now
alway

671
00:41:05,829 --> 00:41:09,790
breaks electro beats in it resides right
but also

672
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:12,800
iron deals with the fermions

673
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:16,880
we don't know that for sure that's why
were still running the I'd see starting

674
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,020
in 2008 alright

675
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,619
sat down on downs a

676
00:41:24,619 --> 00:41:27,960
a hair bars and a lot of play since the
roughly

677
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:31,210
sixty-eight percent confidence intervals
on

678
00:41:31,210 --> 00:41:34,440
what we think should be enacted get and

679
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:39,420
Bay number next on I don't think too
much about that

680
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,609
much much more complex and much more or
ours

681
00:41:42,609 --> 00:41:45,619
systematic concepts eddie's

682
00:41:45,619 --> 00:41:48,920
what if we're all on a the energy we
measure

683
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,150
for all of our guests but three-person
what

684
00:41:52,150 --> 00:41:55,190
wait they're all all offer all

685
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,530
they will get a different NASCAR and
goes on our analysis will proceed

686
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:00,660
differently

687
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:05,920
and all our estimate you get the entire
our results will be off

688
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:09,300
well how do you deal with that well
first you can come up with this 3

689
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:12,050
percent number based on what you know
about the performance

690
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:15,980
actor and then you propagate differences

691
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:20,800
I'll that we're writing that all the way
through the analysis

692
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,810
and your eventually going to you I

693
00:42:25,810 --> 00:42:30,328
a ya on an uncertain your actually I

694
00:42:30,329 --> 00:42:33,390
essentially a floating parameter yet

695
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:36,560
to what usually get energy

696
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,380
up is it down yet we had basically right
and you're gonna let that get fit

697
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:44,839
at the same time the it for the strength
they say on

698
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:48,250
and I'm actually melts yet

699
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,280
he's very complex with the slight spirit

700
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:55,650
go through some details it and what
happened

701
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:59,880
which dates and times but let me just
emphasize one on

702
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,310
up at the end of the day in the yes

703
00:43:03,310 --> 00:43:06,720
are are any procedure in the air image

704
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,689
we're throwing toys for giving different
possibilities

705
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:14,030
system tax how often you need a

706
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:17,050
a Txtr at some point we're

707
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,760
only to see no RB signal and background
at

708
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,480
and then you look at the real point Mrs
meeting he died Bryant LA

709
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,240
and then what we report to the public is
essentially

710
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:32,899
air it workouts in distributed is
peanuts

711
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:36,670
which we're not playing at our how many
standard deviations would be

712
00:43:36,670 --> 00:43:41,099
on week we decided some point this is
good public

713
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:44,810
sacked to say we have three state me and
56

714
00:43:44,810 --> 00:43:48,339
and so this is what we talked about 30
or 8:30 his

715
00:43:48,339 --> 00:43:51,589
and released a we have it made at nates

716
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:55,500
which is what yet I director cannot
stand by me

717
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:58,930
said July 2012 took two experiments

718
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,690
independently he p-value here

719
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:05,720
3 has 10 -7 I will talk about

720
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,848
why he had such ludicrously

721
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:13,950
small eat out its as a matter of course
in

722
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:18,450
big yeah 3 percent did that come from
the

723
00:44:18,450 --> 00:44:21,868
both your doctor isn't very W

724
00:44:21,869 --> 00:44:24,920
okay 3 percent in a systematic yeah

725
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:28,440
it comes from I'm

726
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,740
day bikini actor often comes from
outside the palace

727
00:44:31,740 --> 00:44:35,540
where everybody UK balance your jets you
can call me

728
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:39,500
college something that's foreign us
right I'm

729
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,740
and balance your jacks me something day
request of it the other way

730
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:46,930
you balance the ante at the detector and

731
00:44:46,930 --> 00:44:51,270
you figure out how accurately from that
you can determine the energy scale

732
00:44:51,270 --> 00:44:55,420
and of it actually best technical error
inside and out six

733
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:59,410
in the country Justin at and 13 on

734
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,819
be dishes be any

735
00:45:02,819 --> 00:45:08,250
it's a systematic uncertainties are all
is most are working during the mouse

736
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:12,160
justice in our detector works the way
actually nation says

737
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:16,259
if he darn so let me step

738
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,089
now to ticket results update eats the
day

739
00:45:20,089 --> 00:45:23,220
I that mean to you restarted let all
these parameters

740
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:27,689
uncertainties also the rates at which
different process democracy know and

741
00:45:27,690 --> 00:45:28,319
yeah

742
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:31,660
happened and week yet

743
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:35,480
here we know it. a sick bay ATK space

744
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:38,940
here ACP works sometimes w hat

745
00:45:38,940 --> 00:45:42,200
about no outward patents all and the

746
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:48,049
hairs any heads are string25 production
mode also

747
00:45:48,050 --> 00:45:51,380
at all tells us where it takes on

748
00:45:51,380 --> 00:45:54,700
and we look what's the best generate and
one

749
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:59,589
on this gays standard model prediction
annual noticed a

750
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:03,250
inside the a confidence intervals

751
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,069
a the everything is reached but one
point which gets really

752
00:46:07,069 --> 00:46:10,380
what you expect yes you had about your
brand

753
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:15,180
he's doing what he did backstage he
actually worry they treat you well

754
00:46:15,180 --> 00:46:18,910
so we're pretty happy with it in the
sense that he say

755
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:22,250
I'm yeah it looks like it by the way we
really do

756
00:46:22,250 --> 00:46:26,710
worry he treats you well key if somebody
shows a plot what we're all

757
00:46:26,710 --> 00:46:30,170
appoint their ban on much smaller than
the air

758
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:35,740
say iron that ultimately at her eighties
we get people are time for

759
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:39,689
how on be as 250 don't work like that

760
00:46:39,690 --> 00:46:43,430
if you happen to see X-ray can show up
with the into good

761
00:46:43,430 --> 00:46:48,710
rattan awful I'm that's right side it's
just that simple five-mile

762
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:52,220
where essentially use and you cannot

763
00:46:52,220 --> 00:46:57,089
only take this standard model without a
no I profits you can also see

764
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,349
other in no I bob says let parameters
very

765
00:47:00,349 --> 00:47:03,619
see what get gas and are

766
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:06,819
estate is not or office even offer to
keep

767
00:47:06,819 --> 00:47:10,079
its here and the office the all these
different

768
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,619
case a draft I'll show up at the same
point

769
00:47:13,619 --> 00:47:18,390
so for now it looks like to have a
standard model express

770
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:22,109
what the dog because partner

771
00:47:22,109 --> 00:47:25,509
that their for that

772
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,599
better we observed that involved

773
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:32,910
her year yes

774
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:37,058
yes exactly what we have to this point
and neatly

775
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:40,450
very much like to see a difference
obviously the uncertainties are large

776
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:42,470
and in particular

777
00:47:42,470 --> 00:47:46,990
we a really summed up that particular
articles that we still have very large

778
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,308
areas I'm

779
00:47:48,309 --> 00:47:51,369
I work on the because it's going to be
exciting

780
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:54,400
especially it doesn't look like the
standard model

781
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,869
you just don't know so blood what do you
like

782
00:47:57,869 --> 00:48:01,099
rigby you rather

783
00:48:01,099 --> 00:48:04,640
with different week we certainly way

784
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:08,190
I mean place with attitude you don't
know yes

785
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,800
yet mere net wary

786
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:16,180
we had this beautiful standard model
answers all the questions answered

787
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:17,169
really well

788
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:20,730
and we have other questions we get asked
I

789
00:48:20,730 --> 00:48:24,470
I'm not delving into for example when
you start mad at me

790
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:28,520
we don't know without a signal that
didn't look like the standard model

791
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:32,079
could be huge dark matter particles we
had let us

792
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:35,329
understand more of the universe on the
other hand

793
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:39,510
in turn out worse we could he stopped
for a while

794
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,930
attention proper the user rebel leader

795
00:48:42,930 --> 00:48:46,339
up yeah well people's me

796
00:48:46,339 --> 00:48:49,849
we intelr satisfied a mile the universe

797
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,030
that I think he might not be talkin bout
given day

798
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,619
that people say 1900 it was nothing
important back to be

799
00:48:56,619 --> 00:48:59,670
tits enemy out all articles actually

800
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:03,140
yes after that you know

801
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:07,930
will be appointed uterus satisfied me
wanna keep finding alternate

802
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:11,460
essentially a couple mister we tried yes

803
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,790
I your I'm suit plus

804
00:49:15,790 --> 00:49:19,579
at all created because looked baller

805
00:49:19,579 --> 00:49:23,880
be did a

806
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:27,700
were grown good you did

807
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:32,140
this blue good writer third-grade
Roberts

808
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,190
what pops up a

809
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:41,520
so never struck good

810
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,710
be over predict where r up

811
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:48,410
weaker would

812
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,700
good

813
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,910
you the your article

814
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,000
the article big data Roach

815
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,800
we're actually work destroyed well

816
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:07,339
so I'm we we we had a and a lot closer
to what you're saying

817
00:50:07,339 --> 00:50:11,190
which is instead %uh me say I'm to
search for AT&T be

818
00:50:11,190 --> 00:50:15,250
parts I'm not built my analysis for
something that approximately the

819
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:16,359
standard model

820
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:19,500
and I'm gonna do with it and I'm gonna
say oh it's Tanner miles right

821
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:24,300
in fifty percent %uh you could do a
search for you make many more

822
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,630
lots and you look for any discrepancy

823
00:50:27,630 --> 00:50:32,230
can any of those plots iron

824
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:35,849
from from for example standard model
prediction growth

825
00:50:35,849 --> 00:50:38,880
we have a prediction never did get that
out but

826
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,470
you can have a more general Brian here's
robbins

827
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:45,470
any endogenous you met you I and

828
00:50:45,470 --> 00:50:49,000
a short expecting any any this

829
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:53,599
its debts and out that many if you don't
have enough grass

830
00:50:53,599 --> 00:50:56,790
and updates CK Yankees

831
00:50:56,790 --> 00:51:01,770
you will see p values that are smallish
wat seek

832
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:07,059
down faster and we have we have a hybrid
approach because anyone to analyze the

833
00:51:07,059 --> 00:51:12,670
but and our system for making sure we r
anything contracts

834
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,400
yeah everybody has their own thesis
topic

835
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:19,940
so you know we had everybody sick you
know

836
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:24,109
and I helped by Nate us up to date basis
a lot of people are looking for more

837
00:51:24,109 --> 00:51:25,540
subtle things

838
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:28,619
I'm we do tend to target

839
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:31,970
what particular research porn you know

840
00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:35,750
talk about some the upgraded tiny the
actor

841
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,960
what 30 yes that

842
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,559
yeah that that can actually be able to
delay

843
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:46,079
ok the they're doing construction

844
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:49,950
upstairs Britain people were

845
00:51:49,950 --> 00:51:56,950
happen nobly we don't have an early
evacuation

846
00:51:57,150 --> 00:52:01,550
alright so weird makeup tutorial reason
we're going to start was that no one to

847
00:52:01,550 --> 00:52:03,500
talk about things that have gone wrong

848
00:52:03,500 --> 00:52:08,900
when we had models a ride it's on the
modeling itself brought down

849
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:12,200
I'm gonna run track for sure help

850
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:15,950
and I don't usually do that because a we
had

851
00:52:15,950 --> 00:52:19,589
how many problems me LH series of the
best I

852
00:52:19,589 --> 00:52:22,930
and be we had a me we'd be a great plan
for me

853
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:28,098
guess ok you but better bit better get
pecans are well-established

854
00:52:28,099 --> 00:52:31,690
storage sec the mid-seventies

855
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:35,579
a new discovery about article I'll a
case I

856
00:52:35,579 --> 00:52:38,720
up which KGO pairs

857
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:42,230
I'm gay so that people in new paradigm
for

858
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:46,339
we have this thing called the port model
that Napoli any critics

859
00:52:46,339 --> 00:52:49,750
a certain states show up when you block
airs

860
00:52:49,750 --> 00:52:52,980
up beyond repair lapd's am

861
00:52:52,980 --> 00:52:56,109
and so it these are some that were down
this is a minor

862
00:52:56,109 --> 00:53:00,619
lot but I coupling out of at either
Sunday or not at that time

863
00:53:00,619 --> 00:53:04,910
and this is the one recently discovered
hands slightly more energetic

864
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:08,779
us I'm some people want to extend

865
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:12,680
specter active or working he is later

866
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:16,589
early at s inspecting a are holding a

867
00:53:16,589 --> 00:53:19,828
decided oh yes on

868
00:53:19,829 --> 00:53:23,020
so it backs the first thing is Colby on
Salon

869
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,730
and 1976 where yes let their background
prediction

870
00:53:27,730 --> 00:53:30,730
essentially %uh and

871
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,650
most the little bit your want to add to
that particular

872
00:53:34,650 --> 00:53:38,559
I'll yes and right here acts yes

873
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:42,309
GE is about 12 minutes

874
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:47,530
and everything pocket Asian based on the
understanding that the background

875
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:51,030
%uh a chance somewhere on all up what
they did

876
00:53:51,030 --> 00:53:54,730
fluctuation well thats and I was the
group's

877
00:53:54,730 --> 00:53:58,150
showing up without less than 1% chance
in getting

878
00:53:58,150 --> 00:54:02,780
that happening not my thoughts so that's
it he valued at less than .2

879
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:06,839
it I'm at the time dat ways

880
00:54:06,839 --> 00:54:11,359
good enough to get started gas and power
stocks but in fact they need it

881
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,020
be up so on a case they were rotten
their troop leader

882
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:18,089
leon lederman and there's a terrific I'm

883
00:54:18,089 --> 00:54:22,470
for this I'll boots layup

884
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:26,328
it turned out when he took a bunch more
data the next year

885
00:54:26,329 --> 00:54:29,750
there's nothing at sixty and ass

886
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:33,420
aerial up the line lives in about I want
to keep

887
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,730
on I'll and today

888
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:40,180
we extend of bashing for yup so on

889
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:43,250
and he new way and with my yeah

890
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,849
which is the best in the world for this
sort of thing up its for

891
00:54:46,849 --> 00:54:50,799
that's what we don't get bored you
actually see it up the line into higher

892
00:54:50,799 --> 00:54:51,430
energy

893
00:54:51,430 --> 00:54:56,089
relatives and result in very well now
are these things are good

894
00:54:56,089 --> 00:54:59,940
on so what did we learn from temporarily

895
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:03,930
discovery I'm sandbar or iron

896
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:07,240
wanted that a case is if you

897
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,479
well at a lot of grass if you're running

898
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,329
as a eel Girardi many different
experiments

899
00:55:14,329 --> 00:55:18,260
you have to a choice about you down its
he has

900
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:21,390
on you know I hate you you

901
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:24,790
you figure out basically how many East
i'm happier the only

902
00:55:24,790 --> 00:55:28,040
here how often do you want iraq
informasi

903
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,529
cue what you think he said what he does
this is where we came

904
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:36,480
up with I think that this land just got

905
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,660
we don't want to be wrong every so

906
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:42,790
no requirement after the state now it's
in our

907
00:55:42,790 --> 00:55:47,829
16 and you can't say depends on how
surprising results

908
00:55:47,829 --> 00:55:51,359
you know maybe respects in we do expect

909
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:54,930
HD 18 through a horse what we are doing
this

910
00:55:54,930 --> 00:55:58,058
then maybe we should not last that or a
little bit

911
00:55:58,059 --> 00:56:02,960
or maybe if we can detect that neutrinos
go faster than the speed of light

912
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:07,880
we should not detects iron we should not
wait a minute happened he

913
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:13,589
we get a five-figure on act people who
saw the previous night that must be

914
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:17,369
like do you say it back Asia at Welsh

915
00:56:17,369 --> 00:56:20,660
because day hey I yet

916
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:24,259
eventually apt after in now

917
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,859
how they were running their electrons
and it's just a real problem

918
00:56:28,859 --> 00:56:31,950
you get used to it right statistical
significance

919
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,868
not be just fluctuations but because
you're your models are all

920
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:39,480
that's when accidents happen so

921
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:42,490
another for example that happen were
racin way

922
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:45,790
I wanna the standards Fermilab

923
00:56:45,790 --> 00:56:49,290
iron what's this a where

924
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:53,210
a sickly iron W plus GST

925
00:56:53,210 --> 00:56:56,819
yes W buds on this product yesterday
measure

926
00:56:56,819 --> 00:57:00,040
everything access downright on the
sprawling tale

927
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:05,230
she contracted out most secure
backgrounds you can turn that into a pic

928
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:09,720
and out punch it significance but it
would have been very surprised it didn't

929
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,549
look like aids both are

930
00:57:11,549 --> 00:57:14,900
I'm much actually to I'm being bus

931
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:18,299
so back we have a3 segment

932
00:57:18,299 --> 00:57:22,119
for evidence observation eighty call it
that

933
00:57:22,119 --> 00:57:25,690
what they did which they went back and
look at how they were mildly

934
00:57:25,690 --> 00:57:29,480
objects and what they have essentially
is being

935
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:32,569
on the slope if you can just nuts read
it

936
00:57:32,569 --> 00:57:35,770
the right little bit because you model
their

937
00:57:35,770 --> 00:57:38,890
a repeat customer in other words the
modeling business

938
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:42,400
not answer aids and simple values be
taken

939
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:46,670
withdrawn anyway well initially
anticipated yorktown

940
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:50,109
I when they thought about it and

941
00:57:50,109 --> 00:57:53,890
again you have to be cautious when you
see things that are surprising

942
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:57,450
and you have to book for places where

943
00:57:57,450 --> 00:58:01,730
you don't have that right I'll what you
do in

944
00:58:01,730 --> 00:58:05,390
so rack as I said

945
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,390
you know it's good actually update
public

946
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:11,390
results that you think unlike eater

947
00:58:11,390 --> 00:58:16,500
but it's not good to see you and
something you possibly happen

948
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,670
so it's really where of publication

949
00:58:19,670 --> 00:58:22,900
but eventually pinpoint helps identify
problems

950
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:26,119
on soon went well

951
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,210
region to make sure I miles are on it we
actually

952
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:32,680
we have replication iron starting

953
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:36,399
we expects we have more or group 1p

954
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:39,670
a whole group doing and this is partly
because people are competing

955
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,020
if I do the same in-house speech every
step

956
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:47,990
138 common data and separate if all
across the exactly the same even though

957
00:58:47,990 --> 00:58:49,169
we've written

958
00:58:49,170 --> 00:58:53,089
get back out this is an important
checkered flag get nervous when people

959
00:58:53,089 --> 00:58:54,558
talk about

960
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:58,660
me to come from their papers public you
run the risk that people will duplicate

961
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,680
your coat

962
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:04,419
and it's a mistake the iraqi rather
evaluation shorter

963
00:59:04,420 --> 00:59:07,609
making competing groups try to her

964
00:59:07,609 --> 00:59:12,230
they've got a DJ results with different
okay this is something

965
00:59:12,230 --> 00:59:16,119
another thing we have done in one case
if we had two different versions and it

966
00:59:16,119 --> 00:59:17,180
now says

967
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:20,720
was supposed to be a cross-check the
other their results were different

968
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,730
enough

969
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:25,680
it we could not entirely understand what
is going on

970
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:30,129
its unlikely equifax a cost you 1 St

971
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:33,599
a data it he he's iron

972
00:59:33,599 --> 00:59:37,040
cross-section 1.1 high standard ball
purses

973
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,480
about 20 Wednesday on a pre-made
existing collects

974
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:45,170
but they're not independently
speculation I

975
00:59:45,170 --> 00:59:48,450
year said you get your he's actually

976
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:51,970
interesting taste it by expanding is
extrano

977
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,660
yes first that we actually I'm johnnie
cochran's

978
00:59:55,660 --> 01:00:00,118
a here are a few results we are working
on reconciling

979
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:03,420
down it could be that much we computed

980
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:06,770
how I unit patent down

981
01:00:06,770 --> 01:00:10,040
or it could be something else re going
on an hour

982
01:00:10,040 --> 01:00:13,869
finalizing I started final a purge

983
01:00:13,869 --> 01:00:17,520
ups Nats but it's definitely

984
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,970
when you have to spend discrepancy you
work through it that's

985
01:00:20,970 --> 01:00:24,189
ends up being very strong presence I yet

986
01:00:24,190 --> 01:00:27,799
even going back your time silly take
your

987
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:33,359
it's insane he could be there or attack
will tell you which late

988
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:36,520
also we have to its parents always

989
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,540
at least you have at twenty each other
and you have to

990
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:44,900
experiments trying to do the seed so not
only is the code base different all

991
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:48,049
detector technology is different you
know my

992
01:00:48,049 --> 01:00:52,940
expand has a or check on that with a
remark calling

993
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:56,710
up it possibly anything astronomically

994
01:00:56,710 --> 01:00:59,819
that was the first thing the other
experiments for

995
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:03,849
if you would still make the art C
programming that if there is one thing

996
01:01:03,849 --> 01:01:07,819
a but also we just rent well different
happy

997
01:01:07,819 --> 01:01:11,400
from internal review procedures
completely different code even

998
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:15,299
start points ethically independent
politicians

999
01:01:15,299 --> 01:01:18,470
I and when we discovered a wispy

1000
01:01:18,470 --> 01:01:22,058
guidance we had plus the same at the
same place

1001
01:01:22,059 --> 01:01:25,059
from expects excludes

1002
01:01:25,059 --> 01:01:28,329
is more important unit/units parents
getting

1003
01:01:28,329 --> 01:01:32,569
36 each actually something more
important than what I expected

1004
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:36,480
box let me just isn't it getting by care

1005
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,799
way iron

1006
01:01:39,799 --> 01:01:43,119
so I had only two more slides back might
be

1007
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,510
just briefly see if i forgot I touch on
the issues

1008
01:01:47,510 --> 01:01:51,569
on the next you actually but I think get
to know how to reduce taxes

1009
01:01:51,569 --> 01:01:54,788
how to communicate I mean just got a
size 10

1010
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,799
iron any high we're gonna make

1011
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:02,009
any processing a party at public we
start by reviewing the

1012
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:07,220
internally starting with expertise
higher experiment analysis

1013
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,439
up any tax collaboration had a chance to
review it me

1014
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,049
comments it takes just months to
Government House

1015
01:02:14,049 --> 01:02:18,819
the is basically time something public
and that includes even take

1016
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:21,880
Copts now conferences we do things a
little better

1017
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:26,099
because there's tremendous value E
getting what you have out there

1018
01:02:26,099 --> 01:02:29,349
now too late to try texting the other
guys that we hardly ever do

1019
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:32,369
because we have about the same
capabilities I'm

1020
01:02:32,369 --> 01:02:35,789
I'm but also to

1021
01:02:35,789 --> 01:02:39,950
you know get their feedback just eight
years our analysis and I show up

1022
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:43,919
and I say on your something I didn't
think that that the other people

1023
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,789
on the other strategy and then we come
up with a plan with all major

1024
01:02:47,789 --> 01:02:51,220
player all of us accused

1025
01:02:51,220 --> 01:02:54,700
so we have a little bit quicker
turnarounds and preliminary results

1026
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:57,730
you located yeah

1027
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:00,829
CNN's there's nobody else anymore

1028
01:03:00,829 --> 01:03:05,750
you that things like on

1029
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:09,280
I'll sound final publications read more

1030
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:14,650
he pondered finalize I'm and by the time
you get to reviewers the parents were

1031
01:03:14,650 --> 01:03:16,650
probably from the experiment

1032
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:20,309
there's not much left vacant a.m. and it
partially

1033
01:03:20,309 --> 01:03:24,980
ads you can do more their own review
happy internal knowledge how experiment

1034
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,650
works

1035
01:03:25,650 --> 01:03:28,920
and partly because we actually think
we've worked out months by

1036
01:03:28,920 --> 01:03:33,380
on there are some lively debate
sometimes anyway

1037
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,960
God purchased stage I to bother

1038
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:39,980
than a result in our publications are
always

1039
01:03:39,980 --> 01:03:42,980
available for free on this are high
rector

1040
01:03:42,980 --> 01:03:46,170
I think article it's basically

1041
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:50,460
I yet discover a shot on

1042
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:53,920
problem hawkers made his pre-match

1043
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,910
your you get a read on mock

1044
01:03:57,910 --> 01:04:01,149
call public you took my brothers

1045
01:04:01,150 --> 01:04:04,690
how often is substantial

1046
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:08,180
so I mistake not show up very often I

1047
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:11,839
hit a couple historical examples and i
can only thing to keep more

1048
01:04:11,839 --> 01:04:16,160
program I'm and are response to the
state's

1049
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:19,339
is step 1: the other experiments

1050
01:04:19,339 --> 01:04:23,558
exactly you say he just snapped you have
troops parents

1051
01:04:23,559 --> 01:04:27,039
the other one made a difference I
thought maybe published papers needed

1052
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,369
black they go back and look for or care
on

1053
01:04:30,369 --> 01:04:33,539
and to the first step you nasty print
something

1054
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:38,619
brought EADS non reputation as a result
by people who should be able to find

1055
01:04:38,619 --> 01:04:40,700
exactly

1056
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:44,339
I and that's what happened example
Fermilab

1057
01:04:44,339 --> 01:04:49,490
ever to inspect yet and hero and the
eccentric results that nobody believes

1058
01:04:49,490 --> 01:04:53,189
and not be ready the second step is to
expand

1059
01:04:53,190 --> 01:04:57,470
back analytes usually a corporate monte
de

1060
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,930
I into a more detailed analysis I'll

1061
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:04,910
so they're is a tiny 18 year a day

1062
01:05:04,910 --> 01:05:08,058
you doing update you don't retract

1063
01:05:08,059 --> 01:05:12,619
and say we do that analysis right you
say we did as well as we could

1064
01:05:12,619 --> 01:05:15,839
we outline our options and

1065
01:05:15,839 --> 01:05:19,190
air we got but happy update maybe change
these assumptions

1066
01:05:19,190 --> 01:05:22,349
and you know I see that pic an axe

1067
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:26,470
that's what you know as he saw on

1068
01:05:26,470 --> 01:05:30,879
a few slight ego you missed by one

1069
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:34,119
by keeping alright down

1070
01:05:34,119 --> 01:05:37,780
fishies preliminary results it wanna nap

1071
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,200
data and this is a way a result with
morning

1072
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:45,470
so that certain if you stay can take
couple years worker

1073
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,558
but often we know informally much more
quickly

1074
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,220
day there are you know reasons to look
twice

1075
01:05:52,220 --> 01:05:56,169
that and be worked you can ask the guys
on the other side

1076
01:05:56,170 --> 01:06:00,140
rain are you looking at this are there
other problems you could say

1077
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:03,339
town USADA stepped

1078
01:06:03,339 --> 01:06:06,990
except like 2000 is s

1079
01:06:06,990 --> 01:06:10,479
is think is that house

1080
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:13,940
so that people actually the

1081
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:17,680
referees all work yeah me its own

1082
01:06:17,680 --> 01:06:21,649
your important are the references I me
the

1083
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:24,980
I'll me final journal-ref: her teeth
very

1084
01:06:24,980 --> 01:06:28,260
or because you have to have yeah

1085
01:06:28,260 --> 01:06:32,260
you know it's almost an adversarial that
creates to my knee

1086
01:06:32,260 --> 01:06:35,549
you want people who really would pick it
apart

1087
01:06:35,549 --> 01:06:40,210
they cut which you can imagine 2,000
people all invested

1088
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:43,410
excessive use spamming you have

1089
01:06:43,410 --> 01:06:46,910
some disincentive for pushing people are

1090
01:06:46,910 --> 01:06:50,649
but on the other hand you have people
with a lot of technical knowledge

1091
01:06:50,650 --> 01:06:53,700
who don't want to be there's do what I
get the word right

1092
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:58,680
sold out and so I if I stand up and say

1093
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:02,020
your results here's the uncertainty from
PJ energy

1094
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:06,009
state distances and plant earlier and I
got work so much already

1095
01:07:06,010 --> 01:07:10,119
can stand up and say I know what our
detector is capable of your answer

1096
01:07:10,119 --> 01:07:14,260
should be taken on and we have to go
back and look

1097
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:17,880
for me got her so

1098
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:22,220
my my hairy final not be clearly fly

1099
01:07:22,220 --> 01:07:25,859
is just again no results what do we do
it

1100
01:07:25,859 --> 01:07:29,619
republished we're on searches I'm

1101
01:07:29,619 --> 01:07:35,150
you know and in general when we're
searching for something we don't find it

1102
01:07:35,150 --> 01:07:39,780
back still somebody eat this topic even
though they on

1103
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:43,270
says he houses that I worked on

1104
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:46,509
128 formulate the results is to put

1105
01:07:46,510 --> 01:07:50,170
exclusions as a function up

1106
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:54,430
decades cross-section you can take
people's

1107
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:58,009
so eighty word and actually

1108
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:01,970
camera for this alright but on

1109
01:08:01,970 --> 01:08:06,288
wei-wei expect gave him the strength of
our analysis

1110
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:09,359
and in fact we know it and I'm 25 me

1111
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:12,359
we actually expect we should have
already proven

1112
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:17,000
that a trash rate cut be a little bit
below the standard model

1113
01:08:17,000 --> 01:08:20,279
that's what its black belt black white
your sense

1114
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:23,580
on the other hand all we can actually
sleep good

1115
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:28,219
is they say well it's less than twice
which is consistent with the game hates

1116
01:08:28,219 --> 01:08:32,299
but what we've done instead of just
saying with his proven I'll

1117
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:36,948
office we say here's an alternative what
it worked there were eight min a strong

1118
01:08:36,948 --> 01:08:38,370
attraction string

1119
01:08:38,370 --> 01:08:42,158
which annex the back and not only that
but I exclusion

1120
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:45,759
consistent we were exclusion would be
networking

1121
01:08:45,759 --> 01:08:49,520
so in this analysis we a problem right
track on

1122
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:52,659
and all other area cult supersymmetry

1123
01:08:52,658 --> 01:08:55,759
this every you loose some great plot

1124
01:08:55,759 --> 01:08:58,790
out different a whole region different
models

1125
01:08:58,790 --> 01:09:01,988
had been excluded down here by different
analyses

1126
01:09:01,988 --> 01:09:05,259
mines not here not sleep yet

1127
01:09:05,259 --> 01:09:09,948
and I guess there is there only two
people working on supersymmetry

1128
01:09:09,948 --> 01:09:14,528
different flavors at I'm done it yet and
had lotsa publications

1129
01:09:14,529 --> 01:09:20,310
down so after all he's known unknowns
and so on

1130
01:09:20,310 --> 01:09:24,580
what what now well we found something
that looks a lot like the standard model

1131
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:28,040
ok we don't know it 88's he has me

1132
01:09:28,040 --> 01:09:31,830
and the easiest places to look and some
triggered once

1133
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:35,420
we're still working on iron mile

1134
01:09:35,420 --> 01:09:38,759
my particle physics at me he speaks
collided

1135
01:09:38,759 --> 01:09:42,880
dependent on you means that people did a
lot of different expertise

1136
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:46,060
I'm all running a lot of things together
and communicating

1137
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:49,210
ok I pretty extensively both

1138
01:09:49,210 --> 01:09:52,319
within our teams with the other teams
and also in

1139
01:09:52,319 --> 01:09:56,020
erectile experts bill predictions data
source at all

1140
01:09:56,020 --> 01:10:00,880
months which on

1141
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:04,080
there are a number of topics think that
your ticket were

1142
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:08,110
week it gets there on

1143
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:11,190
yeah we try to wait and see weapons

1144
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:15,500
community this community it alright

1145
01:10:15,500 --> 01:10:18,630
I'll so it where he specialized you

1146
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:22,290
you may get this sense out actually just
from my taught me

1147
01:10:22,290 --> 01:10:26,489
expanding were already a special special
items

1148
01:10:26,489 --> 01:10:29,620
I hate speech I tracker

1149
01:10:29,620 --> 01:10:33,360
and different different people work and

1150
01:10:33,360 --> 01:10:37,059
actors so it all Angeles trade pics

1151
01:10:37,060 --> 01:10:41,300
large and because of this we actually
just in particle physics

1152
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:45,159
we headed by stating very
experimentalists

1153
01:10:45,159 --> 01:10:48,429
bill at run the house the time these
experiments

1154
01:10:48,429 --> 01:10:51,780
and suddenly analytical steps will be
theoretical work in other

1155
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:55,269
the its get onto a different models
based on data

1156
01:10:55,270 --> 01:10:59,429
it sometimes the erratic with all
experimental work to us

1157
01:10:59,429 --> 01:11:02,739
then we have anomalous who are into
business

1158
01:11:02,739 --> 01:11:05,870
ito at the nation's for the LHC

1159
01:11:05,870 --> 01:11:09,500
is targeted toward something rail and
then you have

1160
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:13,060
hard court appearance who are trying 21

1161
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:17,699
I'll solve problems coming out and from
general principles

1162
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:21,059
not what 1863

1163
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:25,800
find bitch me I'll the standard model
and our data

1164
01:11:25,800 --> 01:11:29,860
and what does that tell us about what to
look for next but rather

1165
01:11:29,860 --> 01:11:33,179
what would it be read that really
describes everything much like

1166
01:11:33,179 --> 01:11:36,900
that's the question 3 be retried inserts
very successful

1167
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:42,879
but we can test it for a while and what
can we do at that point but down

1168
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:46,120
all do our own thing some on thank the

1169
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:49,550
X motivates you're sick but and maybe
some

1170
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:53,020
someday we'll find a way kept their
predictions

1171
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:57,800
at my everyone on both sides or that

1172
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:02,400
work better beer spoke
