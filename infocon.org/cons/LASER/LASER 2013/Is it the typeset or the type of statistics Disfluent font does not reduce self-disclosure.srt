cue in the air mostly on

285
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:44,600
yeah quality interpretation it you had

your

289
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:59,440
unit p/n: problem pack everybody

290
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,060
yeah me if you look at it so aschenbach

291
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:06,370
that he had aramark that me

292
00:19:06,370 --> 00:19:09,889
no difference between you condition

293
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,480
so if you remember back can also compare
paper

294
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,630
aidid I ethically

295
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:19,780
net difference between between ignition

296
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:23,020
so this when is what you were getting
earlier this is what we're really

297

00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,409
and figure out what the difference
between our survey and their

299
00:19:28,409 --> 00:19:32,500
why your your work

300
