00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:06,670
huge for you the presentation is limpid

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:09,750
we good

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,690
we waited procedures I

5
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,859
its me features X

6
00:00:17,859 --> 00:00:21,660
its the so animators Greece

7
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,840
and research directly out isn't

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,220
best lol I would like to thank you

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:32,649
your YouTube computer incidents you

10
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:36,370
old X together we will discuss don't you
lose

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:40,030
security once I'm tender

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:43,750
saltimbocca as you probably know
government

13
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:47,160
that that 10 I

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,940
performance will probably its
functionality

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:54,399
only spalding practices not

16
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,730
security much got here the

17
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,489
introduced its the city X good weakness

18
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:04,750
to the computer system this witness

19
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,659
could lead to a security Restrepo
fortunate cons

20
00:01:08,659 --> 00:01:12,760
its now there are commercial article

21
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:15,799
all categories produce to secure it
invites

22
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:19,909
to this thing visions on

23
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,970
the agency yeah it's an organization's
infrastructure

24
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:27,330
specifically where is this assault but

25
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:30,509
go so artifact to ferry

26
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:34,380
security but lol malicious user to

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:38,060
ultimately a situation all the time
applications where he is

28
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,329
or okay to

29
00:01:41,329 --> 00:01:45,408
they can cause comprehensive it's an
organization

30
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,350
security bugs clothes it's right next to
you

31
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,610
and sickening and Saints market I'm also

32
00:01:52,610 --> 00:01:57,289
but I'm which hence one of the basic
pursues

33
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:00,740
its if you decide to release suit me

34
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,839
immediate sense parts be

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,500
any will not work must study the
characteristics

36
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,959
the behavior security must relations

37
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,040
in relations with all it's all true bans

38
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,579
who is that this think it was mine boots

39
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,590
I gots you lucien

40
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:26,950
story of us in particular

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:30,010
respected because it releases J

42
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,049
your secret because the crease or
decrease

43
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:36,370
overtime in this case I

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:40,410
what this is was that these decrease
because it will create account

45
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,069
its then exactly eight

46
00:02:44,069 --> 00:02:47,629
security %uh resistance across the lease

47
00:02:47,629 --> 00:02:51,829
exhibition was in security boxes be
eliminated

48
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,890
earlier other ones its

49
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:59,029
then study the relation between security
includes

50
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:03,780
and the growth releases science our
hypothesis you

51
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:08,050
wasn't security box proportional
separately since acts

52
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,980
I N we examined the correlation

53
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,049
security months other protects artistic
vision

54
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,180
was a Secret Box be together we must
coming from

55
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,450
other its policy

56
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,780
you loosen suckz community

57
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,360
also the previews really will home
belong

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,519
use impression of a small number
products concert series

59
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,299
for are now uses be used lots of work
exorcist

60
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:44,680
that contain I mostly sober since

61

welcome thanks approximately 265 you
know it's

00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:04,349
is it bruised also mentioned to him used
primarily for job up

runs to you softball and

67
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,159
a then I really don't know what's II
Ruiz

68
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,159
the menu only its from their central
repository

69
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,519
which they won't that we used in this
figure

70
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,910
you can see them in a min repositories I
hear

71
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:28,009
group ID represents

72
00:04:28,009 --> 00:04:31,120
across Brazil compare

73
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,020
multiple most the are represented by

74
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,930
artifact 80s every aspect

75
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,930
and have different visions nervous

76
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:46,000
tripled its products version

77
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,750
can be identified by its roots group I T

78
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,790
are 50 good

79
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:56,210
keep in mind that in the repository
prisons

80
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:59,659
are action releases as a result

81
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,810
we couldn't up with no an indication

82
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,740
are many changes I'm be made between
release

83
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,280
in essence this person's were once the
where

84

analyzed all the releases we use

100
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:15,620
I'm its which is it true that as already

101

apart from their paws the study analysis
to

118
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,120
and the task you makin its was it custom
parts 3/8

119
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,940
the you will call worker Graham

120
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,940
its here you can see

121
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:30,660
the percy are sure all our students

122
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:34,310
he is your appearance around axe
actually run

123
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,669
up the same I'm in our case

124
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,318
friendly fire unix-based workers

125
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:44,780
run Sudan's it didn't know

126
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,859
processing cycle which all the workers

127
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,139
include the police best do

128
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,490
after the waters flow if requested

129
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:59,509
past from the queue its this task
keeping the dark

130
00:07:59,509 --> 00:08:02,650
this was typically project that was on
Yahoo

131
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:06,330
local first specimens are

132
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:10,120
mandates will probably its though

133
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,160
something that you think you'll beat the
exit signs

134
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:16,759
its dependencies number that represented

135
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:21,169
their chronological order all the
release

136
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:24,900
and five months was enveloped migrant
worker

137
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:27,929
and its results year also store

138
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,060
in another report its one that will
completely

139
00:08:32,059 --> 00:08:35,468
hugh was notified nah the next us

140
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:39,060
was request

141
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,380
before presenting our analysis results

142
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:46,830
it's really that's not really of but its
roots the

143
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,860
I'm us reports you can see some

144
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:54,160
basic but protects 2 I'm

145
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,199
mainly security released school

146
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,570
a low-security months

147
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:05,750
not could see some primary based
concerning the software

148
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:10,220
its eliminating repository as all

149
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:13,350
or first results concern is the most
popular

150
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:17,519
bucks yours together with him but

151
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,750
practice buttons and the Spartans
security guards

152
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,200
are the most open its miss

153
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,790
this recall security what's your some

154
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:34,560
all that too automation only said

155
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:39,089
see word spear

156
00:09:39,089 --> 00:09:43,040
the experimental Boca degree spent

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:47,370
yeah experimental not particularly

158
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,740
thanks our competitors and the right bus

159
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:55,620
ninja includes good if its malicious

160
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,180
here yet security malicious

161
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:02,410
all previous not here yes

162
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:05,449
sheer security marks 0 yet

163
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:08,560
it's the some all those two-thirds only
here

164
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,029
receive pump this up there is a socket
degrees Asian how

165
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:17,360
sleep discuss to

166
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:21,510
this could be an indication that
programmers right cool nothing remains

167
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,819
their I don't say nothing without
considering SME's

168
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:28,660
security prospects which is an issue
that has already been reported

169
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:33,410
list which for other analysts

170
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,990
we create some homes at the entrance
this is mainly for the following

171
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:43,810
reasons first the malicious took a pic
recompense for the most part

172
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,469
but that's the thing I nations good up
38

173
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,800
nothing isn't also

174
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,050
we wanted to distinguish but s the swim
pool

175
00:10:54,050 --> 00:11:00,829
we've got good call CPU sunspots I
relate to celebrities the jump you

176
00:11:00,829 --> 00:11:04,279
with black will be punished neutrally

177
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:09,089
jim DeMint thats night called injection
ex-members

178
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,399
precisely its this kind

179
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:16,200
let's Rd up in the corresponding lists
most secure

180
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,380
right also others buttons

181
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,790
your sins on this fine but space in the
aids

182
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,439
if not issue as smuts it might come over

183
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:31,310
babysitting that I'm almost none reports

184
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,810
as a result we create suck it would even
pay big bucks

185
00:11:35,810 --> 00:11:38,829
all this time missus subset

186
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:42,140
on the security the great and we call it
security

187
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:46,140
I many with isomer

188
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,930
the remaining bus disputed are grouped
together

189
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:54,930
we could boast only issue school they're
losing you not want that

190
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,719
recall security no

191
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,000
this statement represents presents

192
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:06,500
the number of relations where at least
one security

193
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,529
I'll exists in essence

194
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:13,920
5,000 501 releases

195
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,709
sees approximately or 0.77 percent

196
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:21,859
call it a at least once you security

197
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:25,870
well given the facts those other
products

198
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:30,269
include these promotions as their
dependencies

199
00:12:30,269 --> 00:12:33,510
they are automatically reduced
vulnerable

200
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:37,450
if they use call Prime Minister include

201
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:41,430
these defects not

202
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,689
linus law states that even I'm balls

203
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,490
all %uh site incompetence like this

204
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,680
we expected that the project merchants
the are dependencies

205
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:57,739
too many other projects let's have a
small number all security months

206
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:01,300
its Jan CDs we create a graph

207
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:06,079
the represent the the snaps okay
proposed

208
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,949
they also can grab resented &
permissions

209
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:14,010
and the vertices their independence

210
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:18,480
do you mind that's because some missing
information

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,620
from some protests throughout was not
entirely

212
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:25,250
thinks me dependencies let me know

213
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:28,610
to rocket rather numbers

214
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,070
in also it was not complete we see

215
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,620
Burgess mentioned as the pens

216
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:39,740
huge after creating the graph

217
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,649
we r the pager I don't agree on dates
and rechecked

218
00:13:43,649 --> 00:13:47,000
all hrs book every no

219
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,170
then we examined the securities laws all
that

220
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:55,260
you know most popular notes based on the
page

221
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,569
conference laszlo threatens me over now
contains box coming from the security no

222
00:14:00,570 --> 00:14:05,050
something when do I don't think its
content security

223
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,430
I'm parts give you my its 25 a.m.

224
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:14,649
were latest versions at the time

225
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:18,199
our first you I'm gain in loans hope
your thoughts

226
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:21,979
goal overtime its the relation

227
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:26,540
between almost a time and the traits
from the number

228
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:29,910
a bus production factory its Rosa

229
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:34,680
weird even think you know when company
leaves the correlations

230
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,979
makes me think that effect the facts
Commons

231
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:41,160
its and orignal version number

232
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:44,730
of course all projects to see beat your

233
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:48,310
versions relates to I enter or lower

234
00:14:48,310 --> 00:14:52,010
the cuts as you can see

235
00:14:52,010 --> 00:14:56,500
in is the tendency is forty six counts
to increase

236
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,480
this tendency is extremely sluts

237
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,760
basins know our clients all versions

238
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,410
0 all projects to get

239
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:11,389
this situation was different we perform
correlations between

240
00:15:11,389 --> 00:15:14,459
up concert version or because in
individual

241
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:17,649
runs the horizontal axis

242
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:20,829
in the Sharks presents the correlations

243
00:15:20,829 --> 00:15:24,630
why did we really got since the number
of products

244
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:27,639
don't you dance it's not very

245
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,940
its despite points through is X Laynie

246
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,910
by a large number of products for weeks
no correlation

247
00:15:34,910 --> 00:15:39,060
will be stubs still waiting to see
doctor weir

248
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:42,258
projects where relation will be
established I don't post

249
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:46,180
related the security I

250
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,969
as you can see I'll or let

251
00:15:49,970 --> 00:15:54,630
was me is particularly my home

252
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:58,550
well this is explained by a small number
relations that could be a star

253
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:01,819
Snyder Utah

254
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:05,120
yet this is correlation me version over

255
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:09,779
and number of security yeah no it can't

256
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,839
do not contour I businessmen say

257
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,160
across Roger counts increased or
decreased

258
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,880
significantly across %uh 11

259
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,040
as you can see you individual projects

260
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,459
the constant a strong upwards there are
more instance

261
00:16:30,459 --> 00:16:34,430
this is histogram

262
00:16:34,430 --> 00:16:37,870
this is a histogram all detainees all
different

263
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:42,310
up come on state-run corporations the
horizontal axis

264
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:45,699
represents the number or box what number

265
00:16:45,699 --> 00:16:49,910
on the number of German systems
regardless

266
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,230
the prop in most cases

267
00:16:53,230 --> 00:16:56,350
bomb.com does not change between
Britain's

268
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:59,699
when it does it seems these missions
upwards

269
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,639
nuns not also I couldn't change this

270
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,069
all introducing or Google Inc Lawrence
numbers

271
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:11,359
ok pets this may be the results

272
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:15,219
will do me and on to me a group basis
cool chains

273
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,610
the Transpo all some my tuition

274
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:21,750
room

275
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,530
our next time he owns the relational

276
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:29,090
defects size both jobs

277
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:33,620
let seats turned out correlation tests
between the sides

278
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:37,879
and the District Council its brother
which

279
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,610
as you can see me Satan security I had
taken his thumbs up my

280
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:46,049
a remarkably lower sets on the other

281
00:17:46,049 --> 00:17:49,289
Greece contrary to our ideals

282
00:17:49,289 --> 00:17:53,360
recall the bus that we don't do this
unique I

283
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,399
degree are related to Houston in good
condition

284
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,900
is is communication

285
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,919
that even is a program at school me

286
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,250
Huber is gold does not require you
simple

287
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,450
those in its last bar is making

288
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,020
not to examine the relation between
resistance

289
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:18,299
different basketball the security
parlance Liberty

290
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,809
not be used other systems the Jason

291
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:26,629
number abrasions bout remains open in
front

292
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:30,260
there is an interesting big gonna pay

293
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:35,400
that's also I think he did but its jus
shoes and I don't think it's useful to

294
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:37,000
present

295
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,890
what I want you to keep is that contrary
to expectation

296
00:18:40,890 --> 00:18:44,770
in ok thank you its you included in this
%um

297
00:18:44,770 --> 00:18:48,139
and bottom Persie's on my parents
between to

298
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:52,530
sry burdens with a difference in this
mode is

299
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:56,990
its finally

300
00:18:56,990 --> 00:19:00,940
to see whether August doctor yet

301
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,049
reform ways correlations between

302
00:19:04,049 --> 00:19:07,850
or up there specifically

303
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,870
will probably a big relations between
the number

304
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,969
of the state months does appear in
projects throughout tonight

305
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:20,740
do this they do you can see results and
discussions

306
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,240
the yeah it's the stronger Association

307
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:29,289
as you can see our results so that in
general

308
00:19:29,289 --> 00:19:33,590
mice to sought to get with no harm to
broaden its base

309
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,129
only certain are you up must seem to
call

310
00:19:38,130 --> 00:19:41,240
brother any sports well

311
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,789
different kinds well

312
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,640
months since junior high with are
different

313
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,640
they are either not associated with
other parts

314
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,220
or only wheatly so perhaps

315
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,940
it takes a special kinda some to make
peace between us

316
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,210
bus finance facts called you is

317
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:09,220
experience alters you re issues might
be.

318
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:14,210
now landlord representation it's also
patients regarding the results

319
00:20:14,210 --> 00:20:17,220
experience

320
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:20,220
even be did not are if you think a
chance

321
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,380
increase or decrease over time

322
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:27,059
the fact that brought it up own in the
OC persons

323
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:31,740
concerning security its could totes
answers questions that

324
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,510
want them that common characteristics
all the projects

325
00:20:35,510 --> 00:20:39,250
where security box increased on time

326
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:44,280
just in addition I in summing source
calls reported

the at home in 30 results then

419

business they stop two years

428
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,640

00:29:57,490 --> 00:30:01,720
this is lost yeah I think that

473
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:04,860
this result the problem was

474
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:08,959
