talk to you today Paso were agent

for me and I guess what happened

5
00:00:30,169 --> 00:00:35,230
okay to laser inviting me here as
efforts for his work in the city

today has kinda be international what
exactly is your day

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:51,950
thanks when markers and then it won't be
the only other users were

10
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:56,079
me other top he a three-step process
that use

suggested

13
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,119
today right to it what exactly is he

00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:23,560
friends 6 journalism the images aren't
done and we're now looking to try to

34
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,340
identify

35
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,549
some clues about ok day so

36
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:33,780
talk about harper's I think it really
helps keep in mind what types

37
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:37,220
serving others for handling types Amy

38
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:40,250
AT&T I'll and his posture for

39
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,410
clusters publish and

40
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:46,859
it turns out blood types are churning I
engines

41
00:02:46,859 --> 00:02:52,600
in particular as interactions amy
eddings if you have just created your

43
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:57,109
just being wired IP if you both your day

00:02:57,109 --> 00:02:58,020
any

45
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:02,060
techno and he's the presence or absence
in these

46
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:06,540
actions asking workers for blood and
their markers for two reasons

47
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,049
first personal I don't look into things
you can read and comprehend what he

48
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:11,620
stands for

49
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:15,440
straps and is also perfect for me here

50
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:19,660
as soon as I know lani have your blood I
know your blog.thanks

51
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:23,560
it is critical here that

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,400
you're able to when you have time are
you able to determine the book

53
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,000
percent just by looking at her blog you
don't

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,500
compares like to somebody else
population French

55
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:38,660
workers in any other persons website as

56
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:42,209
latest forecast started was the only
post question I'll

57
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,390
larger and I'll just markers

58
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:49,500
he's enhance so to formally defined as

59
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,799
slickers stop wanna talk about it

60
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,910
cluster anger from sugar one more time
this

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:59,310
have similar taking lol

62
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:02,890
just similar up to researcher and
articulate

63
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:09,450
shines this work as you know yes 1 800
worker annie is something that's

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,910
Simplot in the data clearly discriminate

65
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:17,709
last year mean publish so it's critical
that is both simple survey

66
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:22,048
really understand it ended from that it
perfectly discriminates the population

67
00:04:22,048 --> 00:04:25,080
so example %uh

68
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,710
such a marker might be for particular
master that the average latency time in

69
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:30,700
all subjects

70
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:33,849
as pastor israel's so that is the
average

71
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,780
I'm thing he presses israel's it is
obviously simple

72
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,890
you can hardly using just that person's
data and it is harder

73
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:44,099
that it has to be heard

74
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,100
disturbed g-man ask will not so great
and I i cant

75
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:54,860
I have been here just a couple reasons

76
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:00,020
first 818 s Press bilateral your house
lurched

77
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,180
publish so you have to let technology

78
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:07,450
thinking about doing tumors we might say
something like well you know the murder

79
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:08,039
mystery

80
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:13,360
a lot well 12 looking for suspects
immediately lot anybody that doesn't

81
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,270
Taylor having these

82
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,330
markers will also allow list more fish

83
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:23,460
research showcase on a single stress

84
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,789
right now we're in a position where we
try to apply

85
00:05:26,790 --> 00:05:31,230
Artemis across the entire hotly at the
entire populations

86
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,670
say as not the case so you can focus on
a particular

87
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:39,800
muster time you can look for specific
techniques that were more over just that

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,500
poster

89
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,790
and then I somehow it just im

90
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:46,830
worth lakhs another cluster and you
today

91
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:50,219
gravel overarching scheme I local
population

92
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,900
along those lines we can develop

93
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,960
better outcomes for indication just by
acknowledging

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,890
he stirred musters you it's probably not
surprising that

95
00:06:00,890 --> 00:06:04,419
different clusters will have different
however those that were at people in

96
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,110
that mister

97
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:09,010
so necessarily performance gauge

98
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:12,090
just all guessing luster I use the best

99
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:15,310
out with that particular cluster & imy
that process

100
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:18,550
the whole population and tacking on Omar

101
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:22,230
allow you to determine which cluster
personal loans

102
00:06:22,230 --> 00:06:26,740
you can actually pull this off so
engrossed

103
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:30,080
question that he is multi-part little
day

104
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,400
great composers and markers is take so
I'm trying to

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,159
break this down into three questions and
observing that question

106
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:42,340
yet to the first question is whether or
not they're taking

107
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,989
their mustard say

108
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:49,629
is what is changing features orange
mustard

109
00:06:49,629 --> 00:06:53,659
and only distinction here between
distinguishing feature

110
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:58,099
by saying that and distinguishing
features anything that characterizes

111
00:06:58,099 --> 00:07:01,110
subject any posture

112
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:04,240
but it does not necessarily perfectly
discriminate

113
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,830
the subject imposter printer maker
population their house only dreamed a

114
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:10,099
distinction features

115
00:07:10,099 --> 00:07:15,009
it's not difficult to imagine that there
might be does energy doesn't three dozen

116
00:07:15,009 --> 00:07:18,189
future teachers their characteristic
attended

117
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:23,539
particular roster certain question he
will given that we have loveless

118
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:27,650
distinguishing features can distill it
down to the simple

119
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,068
are looking for finally are many
questions

120
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,409
well you know you have the subjects are
insane

121
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:38,729
mister we know that they're taking has
to be somewhere

122
00:07:38,729 --> 00:07:41,979
but you may also share similarities
their demographics

123
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:45,080
stimulus foreshadowing

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:48,508
the results since I'm not here you've
probably guessed

125
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:52,500
yes there are act clusters are taking
those and assures all

126
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:57,310
should today as for distinguishing
features

127
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,949
there are quite a few ever clusters of
talk about

128
00:08:00,949 --> 00:08:04,250
peace are extreme bowling yes

129
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,870
long time is how long on that particular
you anytime

130
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:13,139
lazy times the time is being Cupressus
and finally

131
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:17,339
her for distinguishing features a urgent
first illustration

132
00:08:17,339 --> 00:08:20,750
features and markers we need you so and
municipal

133
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:27,409
thresholds for will cost you Mar 3 must
after the demographics

134
00:08:27,409 --> 00:08:29,380
yes there's also similarities there

135
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,700
and banglamung results at nasa days only

136
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,720
so a little

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,940
warning here that this is intended as a
proof of concept work

138
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:43,190
I'm not making any place and
generalizability

139
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:47,470
I'm just saying that techniques are you
haven't worked on this particular desire

140
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:50,690
here was raining today

141
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:55,190
so I'm doesn't work we decided to use
the strongest

142
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,970
that and this is a previously lettuce
probably

143
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:04,060
a Texas up 51 subjects Kia Optima

144
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:08,920
provided for a traditional password and
this is done in eight sessions

145
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:12,339
traditions each the password which is

146
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:15,620
intended many a strong password its name

147
00:09:15,620 --> 00:09:18,900
infuriates UAE I handle our

148
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:23,970
leonel all nighter a transition

149
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,920
and just a lot all times and head yet

150
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,620
and I yeah it's just the time being what
he comes up

151
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:36,430
when the next he goes back to the
attention using this data set

152
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:39,449
is that there was an external I refused
area

153
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:42,800
and so the timestamps are accurate to
within 200 metres

154
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,560
its which is much better than what you
can't yet he just

155
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:53,010
he operates however despite having his
portrait sessions

156
00:09:53,010 --> 00:09:56,240
I'm me world using the data from Sony

157
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,040
the invite such and the reason for this

158
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,770
in that city must practice data he had
subject he

159
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,790
her a history here this is what we call

160
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:12,589
practice for along x-axis is the
repetition number

161
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,449
from $1,400 on the last

162
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:20,359
in the time that is a silent password
the red dots here how long tradition

163
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:20,680
takes

164
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,130
tank any issue that editor here which
has a nice

165
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,199
exponential look eso

166
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:33,060
issue is that as somebody takes a
password more more often any probably

167
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:37,589
Harris yourself ready happen password
you're getting a lot better

168
00:10:37,589 --> 00:10:40,779
password and eventually you

169
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,100
line so your performance hywell you
don't change very much for taking

170
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,779
successive repetitions as a reason

171
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:52,519
that we're using any I sessions are
interest here

172
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:57,769
in the subject headings were not
interested in how the standings

173
00:10:57,769 --> 00:11:02,339
archie actress if resolved it is only
available to us

174
00:11:02,339 --> 00:11:05,569
we present value transparent I capturing

175
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:08,689
access tax and potentially anymore for
practice

176
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:15,690
and set up marks for actually measures
so that brings me to the Park

177
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:22,500
are foster's times so you remember that
our goal is to foster subjects

178
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,000
and it would be a bit confusing to
directly

179
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,839
cluster the repetitions the subject yes
because you might have a case where we

180
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:31,560
have your

181
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,540
should meet President 25 and straight 25
ani:

182
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:39,240
muster be and now it's postures does the
subject bloody

183
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,529
search what this over in June instead

184
00:11:43,529 --> 00:11:46,600
it we're going to summarize subject by
single media

185
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,410
how to spell

186
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,000
let me get better is going to act as an
example of

187
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,740
subject I clustering in the inventors

188
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:59,070
and senator Robert tensions will end up

189
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,560
Australia subjects solar

190
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,839
is any inventor same actually have some

191
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,680
nice your data so for us personal
subject matter

192
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:14,859
roses table yes tradition we had a
wonderful time w

193
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:19,390
Ansley times all times are left-hander
indicated by PDX

194
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:22,480
capital T this late

195
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,900
times on right and their initiated by
exit uni

196
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,650
staffers here so already

197
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:32,890
media ventures by column here just a
tiny

198
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:36,590
and this gives us a single vector at the
end of the day

199
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,200
which has a dimensionality here and this

200
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,520
outfitted me a better now access into
like the subject

201
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:49,160
so tough but it's not just reread it

202
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:53,310
and mike candys I'm about to tell you I
did something like he means

203
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,969
faisal busters after the you here

204
00:12:56,970 --> 00:13:00,580
with his cases possible

205
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:04,290
Pastorino which basically pics

206
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:08,569
a cluster centers an as-is each subject
to the closest

207
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:11,730
said and continues

208
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:16,260
any right now but in like that countries
it's the first

209
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:19,900
that you thinking is running late
required prior knowledge

210
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:25,730
K that is the number clusters and Lydia
this week I don't like ask a researcher

211
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:30,100
work and blood well how many blessings
there but you can't get anybody

212
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:35,100
love brady Heslip much it is kinda
impossible task there could be

213
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,430
to you postures he denounced you just
don't know

214
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:41,140
centuries

215
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:45,100
is we don't mind hard history so what he
means his unit

216
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:48,680
said well this subject lost in this
posture

217
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:52,870
and that's it it's like a over or just

218
00:13:52,870 --> 00:13:56,580
consulate you how it is that the the
subjects

219
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:00,890
cluster are related and also service in
different clusters

220
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,640
early right are clusters homogeneous
larger

221
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:08,590
just a subclass with them yes addition

222
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:11,600
postures are they on the old already
classic

223
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:16,010
so we're gonna use instead is a
technique called

224
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:19,020
history and is desperate opportunistic

225
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:22,199
as an example of a hierarchical
mustering

226
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:25,480
interspersed as our

227
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,750
was pretty straightforward there's an
initialization step

228
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:34,869
waste our 51 masters that because the FT
one such as:

229
00:14:34,869 --> 00:14:38,139
dairy a generation we're gonna

230
00:14:38,139 --> 00:14:43,100
cute similarity in all here busters and
the similarity

231
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,239
I'm here anti-aristide and distance
between all pairs

232
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:52,869
object postures so just humans and
almost in the SU postures eighty

233
00:14:52,869 --> 00:14:57,660
a straight answer one subject to Lester
B is a3

234
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,449
we haven't you care not a random care 13
in here

235
00:15:01,449 --> 00:15:04,988
to injury sorry years clarity

236
00:15:04,989 --> 00:15:08,619
just humanized 13 and enhanced

237
00:15:08,619 --> 00:15:14,959
283 only take cash was petrified

238
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:18,878
peace Solaris well you do with these
merchant settlers

239
00:15:18,879 --> 00:15:22,289
carrots p and Selena

240
00:15:22,289 --> 00:15:25,609
only a single Osterloh this postal
assist

241
00:15:25,609 --> 00:15:29,699
up entire so I only get

242
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:33,579
I was technique studies well he's just a

243
00:15:33,579 --> 00:15:37,099
way and a lot result injury here

244
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:40,629
01 Henry is along the x-axis unity

245
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,659
subjects or okay along the y-axis you a
high

246
00:15:45,659 --> 00:15:48,949
which is kinda are trying to measure it
used

247
00:15:48,949 --> 00:15:52,539
mostly in a relative sense to say
whether things are more so more or less

248
00:15:52,539 --> 00:15:55,629
solarium any

249
00:15:55,629 --> 00:15:58,669
yes Canada is defined by the High

250
00:15:58,669 --> 00:16:02,228
first challenge so

251
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:05,629
laser or so if you have for example
objections

252
00:16:05,629 --> 00:16:08,209
20 here first-come injunction

253
00:16:08,209 --> 00:16:11,209
this all right here and hi ira

254
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:15,149
eighty say so he said yes are relatively
so

255
00:16:15,149 --> 00:16:19,179
NASA subject to as a forty-year

256
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,970
the first time changes may be up here
was I

257
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:27,179
maybe thirty so 240 are more dissimilar

258
00:16:27,179 --> 00:16:32,209
day to you and you really strange a
subject to you

259
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,359
and Sunday 36 here right the first time
in josh is actually a strange

260
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,970
here and meditation hi

261
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,079
and us subject to uncertainty 36 are

262
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:47,479
fastest you

263
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,290
I yeah i was just wondering if you could
speak a little bit too why

264
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:54,559
36 buyers I don't know

265
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:58,059
yes that okay his

266
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:02,980
so for the purposes of this top

267
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:07,039
budget busters so there's Sunday 36
cluster which is in bloom

268
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:10,439
parade and this is the same finished

269
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,730
sex there's a limit cluster which is

270
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:18,699
red engender my statement yes that these
are all want

271
00:17:18,699 --> 00:17:21,939
and there are also a couple other
yesterday here

272
00:17:21,939 --> 00:17:26,220
I just don't have time to talk about
today to discern foster here's the right

273
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,480
and its kinda a cluster miller seems to
be

274
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:34,200
you everybody else so unidentified

275
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,500
clusters next question

276
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:41,540
ask is what is it that distinguishes
each cluster said do this for me is

277
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,389
something else

278
00:17:42,390 --> 00:17:45,670
arced crash detection

279
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:50,580
repetitions from such as: in the cluster
but also repetitions

280
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,010
through many subjects not pastor you're
actually used

281
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:58,410
Albany bill the outlet

282
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:03,300
is going to be a list upstage features
rate for most important to least

283
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:06,320
the way it works is going to be

284
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,600
today yeah is going out bonus wins

285
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:14,129
the most distinguishing features alarms
thank you ways

286
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:18,360
and I'll what's your impression that
typically

287
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:23,929
protectionist all logistic regression
were trying to predict

288
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:27,520
usually lot you know janet Taylor
repetition

289
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,629
doesn't belong so many impostor somebody
not but for the purposes of this work

290
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:37,150
actually morrissette awaits because it
right now

291
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:41,100
so as yet slides a laser-like
determinations

292
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:44,139
so you're interested serious in years

293
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:48,730
life we make that prediction and you
because that will tell us

294
00:18:48,730 --> 00:18:51,730
watch features only have distinguished

295
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:56,360
posture I mean her population

296
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:59,860
so to scrap its first russians G

297
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,919
obvious place doing less senior

298
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:09,060
in a lil education so I'm gonna know
your reputation by the smokestacks

299
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:13,330
and this to me age 11 dimensional vector
because I love times

300
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,629
and an at-times here other don't waste I
had I

301
00:19:18,630 --> 00:19:22,460
always W this will also eat
one-dimensional after

302
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,880
because of lonely history teacher and
it's critical that

303
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,590
you understand always are chosen lives
far suggesting

304
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,620
freshen up these are not things that I
yet

305
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:36,850
these weights are learned based on it
and he did

306
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:42,290
the hard a sparsely aggression is all in
your score

307
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:45,590
and efficiently with the notation is
just not

308
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:48,800
he an ex if you're not familiar with
that

309
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:52,310
in just a minute as some were each
charged asylum

310
00:19:52,310 --> 00:19:55,310
is anyway more mind course funny

311
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,710
feature bless you out this form

312
00:19:58,710 --> 00:20:02,190
you know finally just a function teach
her the score

313
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:05,600
probability probability

314
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:11,439
at a repetition belongs to the subject
imposter so here we have this for those

315
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,550
on a previous day

316
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:17,690
and there's also formula logistic
function 31 government

317
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,780
and when mother function

318
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:25,270
it looks like the graph right so you can
see the

319
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,970
logistic functions doing it injury any
real use for

320
00:20:28,970 --> 00:20:31,990
to a value between 0&1 which were then
interpreting

321
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:37,170
as probability and repetition belongs to
somebody

322
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:38,420
as for Ashley

323
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:42,800
completely determines predictions me CDT
in sports

324
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,370
very day it's going to be very highly
unlikely

325
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:50,560
as repetition belongs to somebody
mustard on the other hand

326
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,070
score is very positive it highly

327
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,409
too long to so many muster to the score

328
00:20:57,410 --> 00:21:01,590
is a factor in determining predictions
me but now

329
00:21:01,590 --> 00:21:05,100
look or the score it's nice when your
nomination

330
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:10,040
a few imaginate away and is very very
very very March

331
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,500
well corresponding Turner is going to
dominate score

332
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,110
the damaged scores when Tommy British
what that means is

333
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:23,479
if you have a feature that's very large
way that featured

334
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,170
basically like completely determined
your prediction is going to be

335
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:30,730
that is is highly distinguishing I'll

336
00:21:30,730 --> 00:21:35,320
such undertakings yes imposter ending
this

337
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,520
any wedding rituals larger than a minute
away

338
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,550
the more distinguishing features me

339
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:45,980
so we can run this for the clusters

340
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,820
okay I 36 poster in long

341
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:52,689
mister yeah tonight's game like this

342
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,070
so you have yes from 121

343
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:59,970
you have feature again px appalachians

344
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:04,649
the whole time px you easily you have
you actually

345
00:22:04,649 --> 00:22:09,279
and then you have going on in your life
way the reason that organization has to

346
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,149
be done here

347
00:22:10,149 --> 00:22:14,789
is because latency times are technically
we're magazine larger than all times

348
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:19,470
said here today any flooding we
normalized by dividing through the waste

349
00:22:19,470 --> 00:22:20,809
by the standard deviation

350
00:22:20,809 --> 00:22:24,529
the corresponding feature so

351
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,059
if you look at this table let's start
with one left

352
00:22:28,059 --> 00:22:32,559
you can see that election is one more
thing that he was ordered

353
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,129
I demanded normalized way from largest
smalls

354
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,309
so if you look at 36 table latency is
that

355
00:22:40,309 --> 00:22:44,620
well the most important top most
important features the whole time

356
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,000
capital R rather simple okay on my mind
and

357
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,029
that is a lazy and other multilateral
agencies rate sourcing

358
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:55,360
that displays features that their stage
about

359
00:22:55,360 --> 00:23:00,610
subjects they resist 36k it's not as
though there is only a single-digit

360
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:04,120
or there are features that are unable
which are those

361
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:07,620
starting after position 15 because these
as you're away

362
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:11,340
and they don't repeat this for
whatsoever as Lee Jones influence

363
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:16,189
your predictions if you look at the
right hand side

364
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:19,840
wall we see a little bit more a lot so
the 11

365
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,269
all times ayatollahs past the day

366
00:23:23,269 --> 00:23:26,460
lol tells us these 11

367
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:33,460
times on those distinguishing features
I'll imposter places however still there

368
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:37,630
because well my by the bottom 10 spots

369
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:40,450
they still have been underway so there
is somewhat

370
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:43,820
distinguishing taking from testimony

371
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:47,320
but if you look at this table

372
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,260
you'd be hard-pressed to tell me when
the marker is

373
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,610
what no what is it about containing

374
00:23:55,610 --> 00:23:58,689
I these clusters that sets them apart
maker

375
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,710
population sell the next step what we
did is still

376
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:05,980
these features in March mustard for that

377
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,280
yes I think me

378
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:14,050
love the lake been

379
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:17,070
my yeah you use or

380
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:23,300
here yes used

381
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:28,669
sparsely just so in logistic so
technically speaking the difference is

382
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,610
the addition

383
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:34,060
penalty and County basically encourages
the other

384
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,480
to Keizer always where possible

385
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:40,950
it is a lesser yes no I'm certain

386
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:45,610
the reason it me smart is your that you
end up on these actual 08

387
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:49,169
which tells you a teaser images that are
not important dollar not at all

388
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:52,470
stage a tremendous ted Ligety correction

389
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:55,530
unno what the remaining entries being

390
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,580
very small in 90 he hard to distinguish

391
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:03,260
for inward alright

392
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:07,120
so step 3: distillate is distinguishing
features down

393
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,570
in tumors sought to do so

394
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:14,730
any concept always happens

395
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:18,640
suggestion blasters 360 and

396
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,270
they seem to be identified I'm let the
whole time he here

397
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:25,950
clinton late as well 12

398
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,170
I want to summarize the whole time here
single-member

399
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,390
I wanna do the same delays here

400
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:36,160
slamming into you is four th hole

401
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,450
and annotate me hungry said

402
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:44,130
sonya 51 median value one for each
person I'm gonna break

403
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:47,380
orders yes I median value from slowest

404
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:52,720
me number one too fast three subjects

405
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,810
and then yeah lebanese bread times

406
00:25:55,810 --> 00:25:59,129
and annotate the average initially told

407
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:02,250
and then repeat this procedure

408
00:26:02,250 --> 00:26:05,730
Elise said give you a little bit we'll
see

409
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:10,139
lands at three subjects history teachers
savers

410
00:26:10,139 --> 00:26:14,100
extra features the whole country I
remember I said yes 23

411
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,730
any he see I look at the whole time
aunty

412
00:26:18,730 --> 00:26:22,929
smathers creature I remember a 23 at
this time it comes up

413
00:26:22,929 --> 00:26:26,059
CA it all has to do with it

414
00:26:26,059 --> 00:26:29,120
the average and see that will

415
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,830
surgeon he is position while an average
rating in 1.5

416
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:36,860
Dennis day break to and see with me

417
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:40,949
Sophia others to the hospital unified

418
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:43,950
when you partial success summit
miserably

419
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,019
here sauna like to hold table

420
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:50,340
on the right to delete both tables

421
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:53,509
the position Sunday and it also included
in the EU

422
00:26:53,509 --> 00:26:56,799
below it this is just for your reference
just curious

423
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,720
feel for what timings

424
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:05,049
correspondent sayed

425
00:27:05,049 --> 00:27:09,908
36 here on the issue table the blue dot
and you can actually see that

426
00:27:09,909 --> 00:27:13,539
36 per separate in fact there are two
examples

427
00:27:13,539 --> 00:27:17,210
workers shoes so on the all-time great
last

428
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,350
I did say well tubular 36 posture

429
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:25,459
not household power already upgraded for
you and you can see that draws a line in

430
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,320
the sand that perfectly discriminates 36
from there

431
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:31,360
of jewish alternatively I

432
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,969
K blistering saying well latest

433
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:37,990
less than three again you can easily
verify that

434
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,420
36 slipstream 3 everybody else shrinking
re

435
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,540
now look at the limit

436
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:49,050
mister well you don't have what the same

437
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:52,730
success almost almost success so

438
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:56,660
the some just a little frustrated
hittable thread on

439
00:27:56,660 --> 00:28:00,280
and you can see that look at all times

440
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:04,580
there's a little reaction s which is
subject line percent below is

441
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:08,830
not heard stir but there's no way to
exclude a lot of

442
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:13,409
pastor also neatly very so

443
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:17,370
here find perfect yesterday and I'll

444
00:28:17,370 --> 00:28:20,860
activities even though the treasury's
able

445
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:24,129
if you look at the actual position
members scattered all over the place

446
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:27,480
so I don't might have a success and one

447
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:31,920
so look back at his place

448
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:35,650
who work all that I said well the whole
time

449
00:28:35,650 --> 00:28:39,030
this arguably the most distinguishing
features

450
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:42,230
but which is also are somewhat
distinguish

451
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:45,290
loans eso

452
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:50,059
thought was full name in my knees
information combine the whole

453
00:28:50,059 --> 00:28:53,090
friends at least Terry Generac

454
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:56,570
ivory any this migrating find a market

455
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,020
to do so I'm going to

456
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,299
place were victims

457
00:29:02,299 --> 00:29:05,200
and and it's annoying to you

458
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:10,179
insist that 99 range here just because
not only easy to interpret and

459
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:11,440
understand what's going on

460
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:15,499
so many official a time

461
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:19,820
all tanking Aditi some Goshen be
translated

462
00:29:19,820 --> 00:29:23,519
me I don't like

463
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,789
and the imposter be perfectly separated

464
00:29:26,789 --> 00:29:31,259
binary as it turns out there may be very
many not easy being me

465
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:34,940
the job and so I need to express some
preference

466
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:39,259
at least nine yet like so and when it is
a test

467
00:29:39,259 --> 00:29:43,119
I don't like tissues any such that I
have a large x-large impossible

468
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:47,220
and the market is the distance between
Journal last november

469
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:50,320
imposter and the first member not master

470
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:56,090
at right now support vector machines
were designed to stop exactly this

471
00:29:56,090 --> 00:29:57,678
problem so many

472
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:00,889
not goes the details how exactly a

473
00:30:00,889 --> 00:30:04,090
support vector machine works this I
don't think we had a

474
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:07,119
but I don't trust me on that you want a
good template

475
00:30:07,119 --> 00:30:10,689
the whole time easily 10 rankings and
allow 29

476
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:13,779
NP an arc

477
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:18,249
mister Whitney 1973

478
00:30:18,249 --> 00:30:22,029
23 me we can keep that in mind reading

479
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:26,110
based s and especially dinner table CC
from left to right

480
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:30,139
you have a position US yes you know the
whole terribly lazy

481
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:33,559
which are you saw and I on it

482
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:34,990
whether or not the subject was it

483
00:30:34,990 --> 00:30:38,250
posture along mister and finally tonight

484
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:43,800
which is sheared and here is now yes

485
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,270
eliminate luster get perfectly separated

486
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:51,570
meaner wish if I think threshold as a
seventy

487
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:54,830
all the members look cluster hurricane

488
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:59,678
lessons at and I realized and the
remainder the population

489
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:04,630
has remaining great so

490
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:09,260
yeah I peace clusters their
corresponding markers

491
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:13,480
interventionist ask well and knitwear

492
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,160
Sun 360 different yesterday

493
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:20,240
social are these clusters general
somehow

494
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,640
you know unique in demographics summer
interns is there and i sorry your

495
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:29,650
so it turns out

496
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:33,970
subject 36 as temporal lobes its

497
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:37,550
relatively rare condition and it's not a
condition than anybody else

498
00:31:37,550 --> 00:31:41,260
there Sunday suffers and think this is

499
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:44,429
affect his time in a way to make him so
the state

500
00:31:44,429 --> 00:31:48,240
here leash I mentioned

501
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:53,370
lost your credit is a poster all and we
actually didn't ask for tests yet was

502
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:57,129
just not yeah it's highly unlikely

503
00:31:57,130 --> 00:32:00,470
to be chance P night years left by

504
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,450
but unfortunately there are also women
that are scattered

505
00:32:04,450 --> 00:32:09,580
mostly black leaves here so is there's
not perfect correspondence

506
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:14,428
the membership in this posture any and
researched

507
00:32:14,429 --> 00:32:17,900
the rest were never rack information
from a friend let me explain it

508
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:21,660
but unfortunately morning minded so this
still a bit

509
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:26,400
in question praised his limitations

510
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:30,140
future work so get on my knees hazard

511
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,420
there's no in the generalizability these
techniques

512
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,880
what needs to be done generators

513
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:40,920
generalizability is your night these
techniques on more dates

514
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:46,340
healer I also like to be able to parlay

515
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:50,480
ulcers wouldn't specific day so for
example a

516
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:54,870
it will be interesting to say just me
story well

517
00:32:54,870 --> 00:32:58,229
imposter all in this post together
because they happy

518
00:32:58,230 --> 00:33:01,380
unusual have it a strike the space bar
with left

519
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:06,080
next that tells us something you can
actually hear

520
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,409
others like this that's causing them to
be routier has finally

521
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,450
scripture here for looking much

522
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:17,669
actually use these techniques for test

523
00:33:17,669 --> 00:33:20,860
slaps pressure today is intended to be

524
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,280
it made it to work situation we're using
local repetitions in the same ask over

525
00:33:26,280 --> 00:33:27,950
and over again but

526
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:31,660
question how's that you missed any stage
play people liked a

527
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,809
anything at all highlight

528
00:33:34,809 --> 00:33:39,090
take place the first yes there are
closed

529
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:42,699
sonya is possible planned features

530
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:46,370
and distinguished members only up his
posters from the mir

531
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,330
population these features kevin is still
down markers

532
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:54,020
and that allows us to easily determine
with mustard as follows:

533
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,460
and finally a democratic

534
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,850
also shows that substructure to these
posters

535
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:03,230
so with that I'm thank you very much for
me said

536
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:10,230
in much women

537
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:18,050
just his used

538
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,580
I'm using physical keyboard he

539
00:34:22,580 --> 00:34:26,210
answer the question 18 to general

540
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:30,609
questioning your enemies whether or not
transport resolved between

541
00:34:30,609 --> 00:34:33,690
hard physical we're going to stash
recently a friend

542
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:39,060
sup us that's not gonna and it is true
for

543
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:44,418
almost all the holes temperatures

544
00:34:44,418 --> 00:34:48,500
no ourselves you there you know their
gender and you know

545
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,530
here do you know the age

546
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:56,020
you know whether they're burning shaping
know what the

547
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:59,520
right stations re-build

548
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:03,349
the women who are not in women so i cant
stop

549
00:35:03,349 --> 00:35:06,950
every single democratic disinformation
because the surveys

550
00:35:06,950 --> 00:35:10,169
bring Creek I versus Acer

551
00:35:10,170 --> 00:35:13,790
so I'm not this is engaged gender

552
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:17,210
ahead yes other plays instruments

553
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:20,260
our application is how many hours

554
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:26,640
and a spent on various humor activities
yet there's a long way

555
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,879
last things and I am Telling of mine

556
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:34,630
what those are nigga serving use yeah

557
00:35:34,630 --> 00:35:41,630
in out whether speak other languages he
would like

558
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:42,800
me questions

559
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,370
me have knowledge now that we have

560
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,960
this is that it uses there are markers
obviously

561
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,590
there are certain characteristics

562
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:58,310
tunes how well we can deliver energy

563
00:35:58,310 --> 00:36:01,890
populations you luminaries study

564
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:05,120
do you see sir systems

565
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,240
based on the evidence the you receive
rooms

566
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:11,419
30 that will be fine is

567
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:14,590
use on

568
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:18,220
so as far as I know they're actually

569
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,879
very few working and a

570
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,990
extra innings how it goes arts is
probably easier

571
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:29,600
at what hi-fi system leverage this
information you

572
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:33,880
artificially Ted to transfer featured an
ex-cop

573
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:37,160
as a statement enjoy working I

574
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:40,350
less while the iraqi

575
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:43,910
worried about his p you can take five
days

576
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:46,950
attack whether or not somebody can
access the account

577
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:51,299
no like characteristic starts to slow
and so I have discussed

578
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:55,580
my hands and markers dreams very quickly
determine and these

579
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,549
much other tests you need to run before
you know it

580
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,170
purse great spoken very

581
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:06,300
see more were his life Saturday

582
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:12,450
are you sure so many

583
00:37:12,450 --> 00:37:15,779
user yes exactly so in the

584
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,330
the were so for money me

585
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:22,779
by are you have a lot of the eighth

586
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:25,860
hey all your 0 I

587
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,950
bureau yeah hateful what will the

588
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:34,129
Maine homes I including sold very good
why I have been guided the

589
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:38,460
me and lot numbers eg tables I do more

590
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:41,820
on hits that missus on

591
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:45,280
so I A %uh sometimes didn't smoke well

592
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:49,330
well and I it's all about it later from
here

593
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:52,500
people I'm Lee up because you were so
this

594
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,740
so I'll so if you're doing very

595
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,950
or well from Hill I yet

596
00:37:59,950 --> 00:38:03,120
are what was it Hong are

597
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,670
so for Sullivan s love you 31

598
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:12,520
yes oh yes it is visualization when I
can actually understand somebody was a

599
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,350
okay years I'll said still

600
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:19,740
are certainly Taylor blunders

601
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:23,069
wasn't there so whether I the only way I
was trying to make here

602
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:26,350
is an after pic separation lines
separate

603
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,009
people in the cluster people not those
the only message

604
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:33,010
here the usually Plaza yeah

605
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,400
point is that me hope you being doing

606
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,570
I'm also you home UK and hate me

607
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,760
the homie any were very well of

608
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,300
long

609
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,900
for sauce and you like

610
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:51,420
in a way that I am later remember and

611
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:58,420
weasel so that's my own on yes

612
00:38:59,070 --> 00:39:02,710
to to machines from said

613
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:07,440
mine first question is is there an
assumption that

614
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:11,800
a teenager is overtime so

615
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,520
I already talked about the fact that
there is practice so

616
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:18,740
no his Nazi tiny changed

617
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:23,078
this his a question would be would you
expect these clusters

618
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,930
views by the same population with
another dataset collected

619
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:34,290
last question this is certainly one of
the area's generalized

620
00:39:34,290 --> 00:39:38,099
so the questioner whether or not is a
subject

621
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:41,630
timing think use the same postures up

622
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,829
you're talking about text text

623
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:48,190
specialized password people tend to you

624
00:39:48,190 --> 00:39:51,450
have very distinct ways typing and
password

625
00:39:51,450 --> 00:39:56,950
I'm less hard saying that these clusters
are likely to remain constant in nice

626
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:57,609
shape

627
00:39:57,609 --> 00:40:01,200
attacks paying taxes however as share

628
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,078
all comment George retains a pre-tax

629
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,550
I would expect those a stay say

630
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:10,870
barring any very many

631
00:40:10,870 --> 00:40:17,680
law changes stimulus any

632
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:21,279
he longer

633
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:25,630
any

634
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,020
you ready G

635
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:35,470
and everything earmark

636
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:42,470
public his yep

637
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:49,570
were us

638
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:54,808
so what you can do for any person is you
know effectively treatment is

639
00:40:54,809 --> 00:40:59,780
for NASA doesn't and store you can do is

640
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:03,210
you can't bring any subject any persons
data

641
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:07,940
you can compute mediator us he do this
rain worry

642
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:12,099
all you're going to do with your hair
and wearing them in with all the other

643
00:41:12,099 --> 00:41:13,329
subjects right so

644
00:41:13,329 --> 00:41:18,400
is between say and I said yes you're
right any subject comes between CAD

645
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,530
anymore and it's free hedonism

646
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:26,490
insecurities and later collision it
means as now usually

647
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:30,848
rainy for that and was a hacer me

648
00:41:30,849 --> 00:41:33,900
migraine and I assess whether or not
marred

649
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:37,680
so

650
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,618
I'm combines Martin here

651
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:44,930
and history

652
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:50,990
Italy are his friends or

653
00:41:50,990 --> 00:41:55,319
he will send freedom happens

654
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,790
which who uses for ross's on

655
00:41:58,790 --> 00:42:02,509
is British his you is

656
00:42:02,510 --> 00:42:05,220
and Andy his my

657
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:09,020
he pursue me who love world right

658
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:12,660
here where the my worse primary

659
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:17,440
hard

660
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,970
yes the inspiration here was

661
00:42:19,970 --> 00:42:23,689
two years some sort is there some
structures

662
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:27,220
8 future that hasn't yet been
established

663
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,250
as I pointed out my top

664
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:33,770
one other thing is that he's to
researchers and it was they say what

665
00:42:33,770 --> 00:42:34,359
remains

666
00:42:34,359 --> 00:42:38,779
same treat everybody and still for me
there was a question

667
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:41,849
up well is a is there some kinda

668
00:42:41,849 --> 00:42:46,070
organization here indigenous that were
missing out because

669
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:49,590
knowing that there is organization will
outlast you

670
00:42:49,590 --> 00:42:53,810
do you something based on our I'm

671
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:57,880
as or your frame problem I guess

672
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:01,020
in this is the way he tried

673
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:04,300
say over small are these clusters at all

674
00:43:04,300 --> 00:43:07,609
president first most obvious and that

675
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:10,759
maybe not quite so obvious step

676
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:14,130
issues challenge what distinguishes
peace

677
00:43:14,130 --> 00:43:18,060
musters was trying to jump directly
hands

678
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:22,060
responded that his islamic love it
helpful to us

679
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:25,470
but also because kill just because

680
00:43:25,470 --> 00:43:29,189
identify something as marker doesn't
mean that there's not

681
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,839
other things about cluster that are also
features the meanie

682
00:43:32,839 --> 00:43:36,520
any to that hoster under sustainable ass

683
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:39,570
as let me have just hear me is
definitely

684
00:43:39,570 --> 00:43:42,589
okay well Armani Exchange features and
now

685
00:43:42,589 --> 00:43:47,020
he was told

686
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:50,540
rights law in with a

687
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:54,870
he's animation you the median

688
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:58,410
over other nash's police were

689
00:43:58,410 --> 00:44:01,910
his isolated me any cuz

690
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:07,319
to use that name the other choice WinXP
you know there are

691
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:11,240
he's turned out liars are problem
because people would do things like

692
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,459
skiing holiday

693
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:16,200
as I say please time I

694
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:19,370
usual and you don't necessary much like
that

695
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:24,790
so a Sydney NS as us so I'm

696
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,330
curious about your surge saying

697
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:33,009
here arm when I saw you

698
00:44:33,010 --> 00:44:36,400
Mitchell beethoven just settled back

699
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:41,430
slightly policy yours here

700
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:45,319
right there I almost done yes

701
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:48,630
while here but is out wireline

702
00:44:48,630 --> 00:44:53,280
their top thirties this is actually a
single service

703
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:57,520
this is only a ok Asia and lives the
movies but

704
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:00,980
there are a lot of cash send 10 their
use our

705
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:04,790
I was just thinking that with one for
you it would be

706
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:08,450
relatively much easier personage

707
00:45:08,450 --> 00:45:12,810
36 then to finally come home

708
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:18,930
yeah yeah NRA

709
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,859
yeah I know that I'm I'm still alive the
fish fish

710
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,870
things like this based on the the size
of the sample

711
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:30,009
and and the fact that not all women are
women I and the

712
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:33,460
in the way then staged Boston yes but 36

713
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:37,070
so much a wonder it somebody in

714
00:45:37,070 --> 00:45:41,770
normal like the stage are fairly fast
but actually force themselves

715
00:45:41,770 --> 00:45:45,330
to slow down because I believe
distinguish the gym mister

716
00:45:45,330 --> 00:45:49,310
large values number latencies and but
it's also

717
00:45:49,310 --> 00:45:52,420
can go back to that sir this is not only
a tad

718
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:55,620
giving day

719
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,920
as not only delays he has a great law is
also that he

720
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:03,850
all times are very short ok year

721
00:46:03,850 --> 00:46:07,360
so it turns out the disease has a fairly

722
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,770
easy to control because these are a so
here's a

723
00:46:11,770 --> 00:46:14,930
play what's up 36 the bottom

724
00:46:14,930 --> 00:46:19,319
the FAA very fast all times it turns out
that

725
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:22,680
as far as for a little work done First
Nation

726
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:26,810
Alizee times early first day especially
for slow

727
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:30,490
retiring and president clinton is really
fast slowly

728
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:33,790
but control the whole time is actually

729
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:36,880
like typical it's not it's very
difficult

730
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:41,180
in say okay generate a whole 50
milliseconds

731
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:44,790
not 55 as a tyrant

732
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:48,850
difficulty controlling and so that often
having purchased

733
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,170
it helps in person a you have to change
undertakings

734
00:46:52,170 --> 00:46:56,780
as like all nothing's impossible
inspired

735
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:01,340

I'm here

day here

750
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:03,650
change between usual

751
00:48:03,650 --> 00:48:10,119
here played

752
00:48:10,119 --> 00:48:15,019
shipping he

753
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:19,328
more consistency in

754
00:48:19,329 --> 00:48:22,920
you she's

755
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,029
me the Sun

756
00:48:26,029 --> 00:48:29,259
strange eso us

757
00:48:29,259 --> 00:48:32,940
what you describe this is actually the
three-test that is you have

758
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:36,219
different people in different things
fees

759
00:48:36,219 --> 00:48:39,719
may not necessarily have over last both
in terms of characters

760
00:48:39,719 --> 00:48:43,749
and also in terms dining chairs and

761
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:48,029
the whole forces that you will be able
to develop such a framework

762
00:48:48,029 --> 00:48:52,039
to work on pre-tax but as far as I know
there's no way

763
00:48:52,039 --> 00:48:55,690
really hung up with anything that is

764
00:48:55,690 --> 00:49:00,079
very general in nature that addresses
this free text from

765
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:03,140
people don't really creeping like
slightly fewer

766
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,339
three sections very much right middle
and will call

767
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:09,819
positions between these different
sections trainer left left

768
00:49:09,819 --> 00:49:13,369
middle middle right some something

769
00:49:13,369 --> 00:49:20,369
more revealing what you're describing
Tuesday

770
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:25,140
week

771
00:49:25,140 --> 00:49:32,140
well visually special

772
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:36,819
so this is old

773
00:49:36,819 --> 00:49:43,819
of orange

774
00:49:45,039 --> 00:49:49,720
in

775
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:51,990
your okay

776
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,069
in huge day

777
00:49:55,070 --> 00:50:00,120
much know so this this is all

778
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,130
only sessions session efficient

779
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:06,830
clear so a there's

780
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:10,060
he said 50 reps and a happens here

781
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:13,779
so the first session is getting this
stuff here on the left and you can see

782
00:50:13,780 --> 00:50:14,830
there's a lot of change

783
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,940
on the honey the last year

784
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,270
visions here this is a where you can see
the current so there's no change

785
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:26,540
really in take a 30

786
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:32,320

data from up here

791
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:53,319
subject with data from here same's and
that's great but distinct

792
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,470
same's so your CV

793
00:50:56,470 --> 00:51:03,450

session you can see that

795
00:51:07,089 --> 00:51:11,380
if why it's kinda he works blow

796
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:14,430
everybody is headed to get in sync not
any

797
00:51:14,430 --> 00:51:17,848
clearly-defined good structure

798
00:51:17,849 --> 00:51:22,369
market because is a looker numbers
another person had

799
00:51:22,369 --> 00:51:26,190
might be down here person my here may be
appearing here

800
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:30,099
so you know many occurs in many
different subjects and just going to be

801
00:51:30,099 --> 00:51:31,240
a starter

802
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,270
where they start is almost friend in a
way

803
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:37,509
next very hard identified structured

804
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:41,069
because you haven't yet let everybody
getting this

805
00:51:41,069 --> 00:51:44,990
play where their practice and where they
said don't you

806
00:51:44,990 --> 00:51:48,839
particulars angle years stringfellow's

807
00:51:48,839 --> 00:51:51,900
finalized taking and not

808
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:57,360
some changes there

809
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:00,300
is there some Lumion this leader

810
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:03,790
night you see this with leaders from the
other others only

811
00:52:03,790 --> 00:52:06,930
yet it looked there so leave here

812
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:10,940
to about how much practices no that

813
00:52:10,940 --> 00:52:14,100
it will be interesting to see whether
you got the same results

814
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:17,680
yesterday are session

815
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:21,109
by for as you've got a large

816
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:24,760
a where you go slate here's hoping their

817
00:52:24,760 --> 00:52:28,670
a me you know how much better to see

818
00:52:28,670 --> 00:52:32,160
yet Hugo from sessions for its source

819
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,500
flat now to today yeah

820
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,440
and so I and is actually were right I
have been doing

821
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,470
almost but not now talks just about acts
nine

822
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:47,490
his mustering just about practice and

823
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:50,560
I thank you it when someone loves
changeable

824
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,600
tolerates if I recall I think the

825
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,490
immediately somebody have an expected
change about 10 sec

826
00:52:57,490 --> 00:53:01,160
holiday password doesn't insurance will
not sure

827
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,420
250 repetitions and its gonna

828
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,770
to you it work percentage change %uh I
think

829
00:53:07,770 --> 00:53:11,580
to get like .1 percent is all the way
out 300

830
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:16,799
onlookers us but you're right it will be
interesting to know

831
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:21,760
if for no other reason than future work
how much did you actually need

832
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,670
life

833
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:25,980

England here baghdad this picture but

840
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:58,080
certainly an idea tech sugar

841
00:53:58,660 --> 00:54:01,750
was one last question your pasttime
lines are

842
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:08,750
his

843
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:17,270
looking is my alright here

844
00:54:17,270 --> 00:54:20,040

X which is ideal my he say

846
00:54:24,430 --> 00:54:29,290
cash uses a should seems difficult he
can do this

847
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,740
a.m. his team's

848
00:54:32,740 --> 00:54:36,500

849
00:54:36,500 --> 00:54:42,610
so angry is your question he would
change your settings

850
00:54:42,610 --> 00:54:47,570
humidity this in response his particular
day

851
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:51,060
his tiny is there seems

852
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,160
here years Weatherly it

853
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,879
maximally distinguish very large
population

854
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:04,880
session race unit meets he said

855
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:09,459
seems how many changes research designed

856
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,250
expense it is clearly excessive the
hatchet

857
00:55:13,250 --> 00:55:16,480
is ending his life yet

858
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:20,140
going say major last year

859
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:23,220
is really about design trace

860
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:26,959
contacted raised

861
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,840
yeah so yes or no answers only more
general question which is

862
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:35,010
yesterday mix as a whole what

863
00:55:35,010 --> 00:55:38,550
for a few months use for your experiment
how do you want to distinguish

864
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:43,120
people what free Hughes and the
difficulty

865
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:47,100
he's currently answering that question
during a satisfactory answer

866
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:51,640
if he actually know very little to help
people type because the way

867
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,819
researchers dont last many years mister
denny

868
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:58,370
next people say handguns and a half per
year

869
00:55:58,370 --> 00:56:01,569
here after they did ya I got

870
00:56:01,570 --> 00:56:04,970
eighty-three percent Crk friends

871
00:56:04,970 --> 00:56:08,830
loans let's hang a sec signing day and
there's

872
00:56:08,830 --> 00:56:12,049
really a great little bit Tuesday

873
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:15,980
okay here on the deserve be eight years
that AC

874
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:19,010
that so I can tell you some things I
enter

875
00:56:19,010 --> 00:56:22,660
it said well Ted the long pauses between
sold

876
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:25,870
people time well that's not a very
strange

877
00:56:25,870 --> 00:56:29,650
where I probably should make an effort
put into larger but

878
00:56:29,650 --> 00:56:34,310
even something very basic I wish you had
anticipated

879
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:37,480
thing about our mission

880
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:40,570
Chongqing and so on and so forth it

881
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:43,680
we just haven't explore that in this
field on

882
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,210
think that's what it means shortcomings
to be able to answer a question

883
00:56:47,210 --> 00:56:50,900
play those perfectly reasonable test

884
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:55,290
I responded

885
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:59,610
world news well

886
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:06,610
sure hard

887
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,240
the other

888
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:12,720
who some

889
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,368
all were from

890
00:57:16,369 --> 00:57:23,369
should

891
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:32,430
a strong result here

892
00:57:32,430 --> 00:57:32,680
week
