already within the larger organization
GOP

00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:10,380
and these people didn't want to talk to
each other

60
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:14,450
they didn't want to know about it needs
the

61
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:17,640
from falling apart home where they found
in their networks

knowledge the analysts have is taxes it

00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:57,480

we'll work with the people in that
society and

127
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,020
alternately you hope to be accepted
while still retaining the

128
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:33,289
he wanted server and brush people who

129
00:08:33,289 --> 00:08:39,179
in this is that knowledge and ranch
right as a contribution to the mall and

130
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:39,679
I'll

131
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,848
I heart page more people RR

132
00:08:43,849 --> 00:08:47,030
stands in there at present

133
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:50,089
security operations and

134
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:53,560
some other your

135
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:59,199
as long as two years in that city are
not much progress have

136
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:03,250
were here special alright is that worry

137
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,910
walking questionnaires no more meaning
that a thirty minute window

138
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:10,100
because someone who's never seen before
on energy yeah

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,230
and if they don't want you know
preferably what you doing

140
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:17,800
you are going to ensure that young age
turnout

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:22,079
on and yet they may not know

142
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,320
what they know %uh that won the battle

143
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,080
point I'm then while work years that

144
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:32,600
people or you are observing

145
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,140
don't necessarily know only no

146
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:40,230
that way or however many just saw and
was an alternate

147
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:43,370
I'm so

148
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,480
or trying to do is over

149
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,980
tacit knowledge up yet much for our
surcharge

150
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,000
in region and in the process

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,170
researchers create users and who knows
certainly the wrong way

152
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:02,500
now here's a brawl your ideal

153
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:06,470
now all Cheryl for a public holiday

154
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:09,850
deal and show we have no

155
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:13,350
evidently with the only right there

156
00:10:13,350 --> 00:10:17,510
of only are only we had

157
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:21,330
still only her and respected and lou
Charmelle

158
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,740
I'm sorry I sure that of data

159
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:28,350
I'll with labor yeah

160
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:32,640
used for working on it are more
introspection robotic

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:36,360
you don't use all an illusion also

162
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:41,150
injuring and drive you not understand
what he's doing

163
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:45,439

but are you know

170
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,970
then we get out of this are incited

00:11:13,970 --> 00:11:18,400
and aren't you singer improved arm

172
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:22,230
the resolve everything into so yes

173
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:25,370
almost here

174
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,640
I think or here great minute well that

who it was and am still at work ginger
helmsley's

176
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,300
on little paradigm

177
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:40,060
as you know you get a room or out I'll
I'm here system or something like that

178
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:43,449
they problem you know

179
00:11:43,450 --> 00:11:48,560
they've got here as is I make the mac
Address is you writer

180
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,979
registration date yet

181
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,970
you sheens actually doing this because
then dynamic IP address

182
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:58,080
I'm system and to the same IP address
many different version of

183
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:02,480
their I'm I you don't know who

184
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
more and write poems and essays about
five minutes to

185
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:09,459
patiently him by name upmarket for

186
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:13,270
you know that I am good if he isn't like
here

187
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:16,340
long and boring you know

188
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:20,760
they're all you get on-demand take it
from there

189
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,740
on per day and you're under 18 remember
is how many

190
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:28,510
day processor and I'm so this is our

191
00:12:28,510 --> 00:12:31,580
too nice don't look at it

192
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,660
you know we want this hour-long not only
is very stable

193
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,939
with age we've been

194
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:42,360
rumour all available on the market I
love the idea

195
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,820
in or calls like that

196
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:48,970
registration data and say okay that is
and

197
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:54,730
owns a building rooms but also yes
always exactly what you need

198
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:58,750
films and on reaction and loving person

199
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:02,350
chain or on the ABC's of water or what
you know

200
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:06,510
I'll and Hall I'll and at times

201
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:09,950
inches pretty much for one all

202
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,070
you wanna know that'll was the thing
that is a breakthrough

203
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:18,090
and engendered trust

204
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:21,710
and at that point arm

205
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,920
the

206
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:30,010
troll was for coded lol was not program

207
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:34,140
adds up watch I and

208
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,850
whether maybe we're they demonstrated

209
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:42,460
and Halozyme show more problems or

210
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:45,670
are no more all about and whether

211
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:47,699
this many were here a

212
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:51,878
because control really was not at all

213
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,350
getting the knowledge in getting the
truck

214
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:59,100
the emotional in getting our lives who
was only

215
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,049
he able allow us to build barrier

216
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:06,379
be home suddenly become president

217
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:10,369
in you know medium saw and

218
00:14:10,369 --> 00:14:13,799
I you know people getting on the field
goal that was being

219
00:14:13,799 --> 00:14:17,399
I'm so but hospital he was a

220
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:21,279
us or some observers and we'd run
there's a

221
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,639
I well I'm I'm thinking this may have
been one of the things that the clinton

222
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:27,529
is understood

223
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:31,160
arm but I just heard what I homered
missile

224
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:35,999
and then there's schools somebody with a
similar problem that they were

225
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:39,290
impulse and number and then headed by
came out swinging in the

226
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,589
on someone else came up with another one
and British so no more

227
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:47,739
number room analyses were being handled
by

228
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:51,350
the particular or a derivative problems
all

229
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,499
on and several other than 20

230
00:14:55,499 --> 00:14:59,329
more tedious and time-consuming were

231
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:03,498
already to the point where they were
headed off to lower levels of the actual

232
00:15:03,499 --> 00:15:08,139
computer operations for ruptured because
it was so easy now

233
00:15:08,139 --> 00:15:11,290
there you go a in the regression is on

234
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,639
G or a you know want you to hear

235
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,089
wrong own so

236
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:21,500
are open

237
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,699
home here is that we really think that
she heard researchers

238
00:15:25,699 --> 00:15:29,329
if you will be working on called more
you

239
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,979
go to work with people who are going to
use

240
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,149
find out what they actually new

241
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,690
on mobley normal one writings are

242
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:47,220
that later were will be a little less
listeners people who have the waterline

243
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:49,170
histology whereas approach

244
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,079
in I didn't know I'm for intrusion or
something like that

245
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,459
doesn't necessarily decisions on is one

246
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:59,910
am shot it away for

247
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:03,319
it's got to be a problem they're
actually broader

248
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:08,170
at any in this particular case

249
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,339
who was accepted heatedly re-engineered
or

250
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:15,769
all and improves productivity by law

251
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:20,220
on well that's because the whole

252
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:25,250
little when the knowledgeable at work
flow of and she's only then that it

253
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,769
would be really sad

254
00:16:26,769 --> 00:16:30,250
it we had no poland that workflow

255
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,510
there's a point the whole acceptance was

256
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:38,080
he's gender in person researcher and
cohesion

257
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:41,760
ish no I'm for the star

258
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:46,010
the only Asian was hebron from her
appearance as

259
00:16:46,010 --> 00:16:49,150
that our your monitor

260
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:54,100
we realize this isn't one saw since
we're all the paper we had

261
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,150
people working in version of and they
are

262
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:01,980
someone and work in India for including
the

263
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,620
them well any change he has been getting

264
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:09,169
will one where are research in

265
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:13,910
humiliated and in the world environment
and it takes time

266
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:16,950
home so

267
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:19,980
wing on the aircraft was very clear it
was

268
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:23,510
or wonder you were users

269
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:28,600
prime or harmful Omaha up really nice
and cool winters

270
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:31,719
I'll and all you know

271
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:35,440
last thing I want people to almoner I
know

272
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:40,010
menu um on that forward in our hotel

273
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:43,720
I am NOT programs are apples are reasons
it won't happen

274
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,820
in a column program if he had been on a
programmer

275
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:53,780
the done that and we problem with
headlines all the way

276
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,879
for our site and want full wasn't

277
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:59,560
it was not or official

278
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,629
your initial the warm your

279
00:18:02,630 --> 00:18:06,480
hey mr. J in

280
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:10,880
the research involving so much and

281
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,370
it was under way who that is so what and

282
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:21,090
review more approval time when Holly and
176

283
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,850
in the abstract when should he did give
away their England all

284
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:28,030
innocently as humans are freezer

285
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:31,820
we explicitly mention the IR room are

286
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:35,439
in group in the bay albeit a little well

287
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:38,560
it was there and it was very clear

288
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:44,169
you read well-known miss one reviewer
who mentioned it is probably not

289
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:48,420
ruling or maybe we didn't need me we're
all in this or

290
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:52,020
now I'll within the institution

291
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,420
which yeah not page prior people need
more there

292
00:18:56,420 --> 00:19:00,590
I'm on that so we have some some

293
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,050
problems and dealing with that home

294
00:19:04,050 --> 00:19:07,100
it always is songs

295
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,520
and we were chastised 1 p.m. you know
something

296
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:15,340
major break from sure I read and reread

297
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:19,040
or letter saying that because I didn't
see any requirement

298
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:22,149
head creating breakthrough in sure

299
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:25,620
I thought you hated use at Wendys fun

300
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,120
and I think by the standards of me and a
lot of people feel when you're going to

301
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:30,590
work

302
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:33,620
we model the procedures that are so

303
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:37,899
there so I'm not sure ur when

304
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
from improved science and as a when

305
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,740
is a hands more prime on arm

306
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:47,910
anybody

307
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:51,480
who had their programming knowledge and
wonders and we're

308
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,730
world probably couldn't come up with
more cool

309
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:58,980
it turned out those aren't comprising
drive MySQL

310
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:02,310
they first time around on I'm yesterday
yes

311
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:07,810
and you I won't let you know on SQL
database which had a

312
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:11,899
I just bring and everything works just
bought one day

313
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,360
used schedule %eh the they don't

314
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,260
or the like I'm police he had a
relationship between

315
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:23,960
you know mattresses at me IP addresses
available

316
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:27,760
me that range and that part of that
whole or

317
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,500
you are because please short for there
are a lot of network

318
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,970
on board access points needed for IP
addresses

319
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:40,020
I every time associate those arm

320
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:43,620
so are Utah

321
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:47,899
he got it I run building that

322
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:51,230
pretty good I'll stern

323
00:20:51,230 --> 00:20:54,300
anymore population has

324
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:59,419
all from his phone someone you have been
well

325
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:03,360
a me people will call him listen up

326
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,780
here pollution and begin to understand
with your comment from

327
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:11,899
user why did they that you didn't tell
you about

328
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:14,940
invention I'll what it is they're going

329
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,070
so without

330
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:21,200
the breakthrough really

331
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,750
couldn't have no understand you know

332
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,090
for world the allow that will

333
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,129
as a told her him a lot of Birmingham

334
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,530
form handwritten letters of complaint
your own

335
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,860
it with someone

336
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:41,169
and up lots and lots them

337
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,270
well all is not so much fun

338
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,740
on jackie is now turning and others are

339
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,270
and the situation there is quite
different we had a summer intern

340
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:56,710
burden on and off saw as different ways
to better able

341
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,810
for no the

342
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,850
the column factor in all those years

343
00:22:03,850 --> 00:22:07,550
in all haitians yes on the hearing the
trial

344
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:11,409
I'll important saw or you lose

345
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,880
behold and that

346
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:18,510
at point but

347
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:21,710
but was a really interesting page

348
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:24,790
people and injuring I'm the

349
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:28,730
really going on last we heard this
office

350
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:34,550
he told payment or all okay

351
00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:38,540
so surveys

352
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:41,770
they saw million you

353
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:45,280
the situation changes a little bit and
they needed someone

354
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,850
I'm all official

355
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:53,189
or people out there or

356
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:56,370
because no we all

357
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,969
and he

358
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:02,050
bring or you Jane

359
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:05,460
workers or and

360
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:09,060
I don't know mansion there I mean we
have I'll

361
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,760
Saunders only the the so it shows

362
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,500
move within the organization you don't
remove his

363
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,100
also interested in all creation and

364
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:24,110
in this case they have and Adam love
higher

365
00:23:24,110 --> 00:23:27,709
he says I've got a lot more i dont like
me

366
00:23:27,710 --> 00:23:30,970
page say I

367
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:34,650
well a rational are the so he will
probably

368
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:39,370
in just fine and as long as he stays
there already gone on

369
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:42,629
someone paying a lot more somewhere else
on

370
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:47,160
they all the same way my way jury had up
on that

371
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:50,440
but we games useful knowledge

372
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,630
for are all viable solution problem and
this is one of the things that will pay

373
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:59,490
many population many different kinds of

374
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,760
it home will move on Fisher

375
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:09,460
the whole well all will is not a general
solution one

376
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:14,210
or we always right no is as the starter

377
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:18,440
probably work here on there's no
injuries are

378
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:23,100
and when someone's on for him okay we'll
talk about this

379
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:27,129
in I'll yet did he know the annenberg
you know

380
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:31,910
and I'll a little bit the long run

381
00:24:31,910 --> 00:24:35,040
sutton's morning soap opera

382
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:38,460
here in the back and revisit their
sleepy a

383
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,280
what's your personal issues in your arms
and legs arms and being done here and

384
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,170
waiting

385
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:47,590
many other 2009 about I'm mo

386
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:52,070
about that and I'm when you have a paper
on other aspects

387
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:55,840
work has appeared in The
september/october issue 0

388
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,459
shearing perhaps up nicely with
pollution along

389
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,520
and response centers outrage

390
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,800
as so you can find out more information
at all

391
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:10,350
actually I'm I and shorter Stadium

392
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:13,840
where it was early last summer in the
program that written

393
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,730
on in and that so that's basically what
I had

394
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:23,310
love it so that I can go backwards his
own backbone

395
00:25:23,310 --> 00:25:28,860
yeah I'm so

396
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,909
sometime there's a master I'm

397
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:35,980
knowledge that possible

398
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,180
10 which for example his track

399
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:41,780
down I'll policy for okay

400
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:44,810
who are really good arcade

401
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:48,889
better Halford personal for as I have a
very nice

402
00:25:48,890 --> 00:25:52,750
class not whether you know expect here
here are the

403
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:55,920
a team-high cool knowledge here's why

404
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:00,280
anyone we're after I'll situation but in

405
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,290
not interested for example was this
journal

406
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:06,310
models which is a very big problem and
yours

407
00:26:06,310 --> 00:26:10,840
he hoped that guy that was deemed a mad
person of interest to hear that a lot of

408
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,250
time

409
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:15,270
I here's how you make their with
knowledge in knowledge

410
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:18,350
hearing more about it next time I have
been kinda

411
00:26:18,350 --> 00:26:22,100
the the big picture you know narrow
moesha

412
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:26,480
you pursue and the implications for
getting really reviving

413
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:30,610
okay I'll let me answer that

414
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:35,260
already are or having more arm I have
letter

415
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:39,020
questionable the all this is that I was
wrong about

416
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,690
your on the horizon right yeah on you
know

417
00:26:42,690 --> 00:26:46,140
it took over a year to get

418
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:50,070
point where the hell that also okay

419
00:26:50,070 --> 00:26:53,330
so during that year we didn't get his

420
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:58,960
law are in the next six months or so

421
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:02,120
when he read the or we got

422
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:06,409
but I'm this is a relatively small

423
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:10,880
saw that during the engines that they
handle or

424
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:14,019
no onto a very small number

425
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:17,090
for me white you more you know

426
00:27:17,090 --> 00:27:20,449
on well you know is a

427
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:23,799
I say University saw

428
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:27,168
an edge dealing with I'm so

429
00:27:27,169 --> 00:27:30,340
operational overhead you know an
alarming

430
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,139
lot of places like that lol and on

431
00:27:34,139 --> 00:27:38,029
its not necessarily alone

432
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:41,720
I'll I'm all-important I'm

433
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,120
information and I'll Yahoo placement

434
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:48,508
we manage on so

435
00:27:48,509 --> 00:27:52,399
its own and i think is Asian agreements
are certain

436
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:55,739
ninety-nine percent with urine so

437
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,889
on you know won the

438
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,199
other tools that we don't actually want
to know crackdown whole amount of

439
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,419
that problem here on

in you know you she showed up on an

441
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,220
percent worse and hidden treasure

University a weekend or

443
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:18,940

00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:50,650
use option I resolutely

482
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:53,870
would do I would below

483
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:57,030
grows something like you

484
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,080

she would him okay so

494
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:37,470
I I didn't see the paper so I have to
ask

495
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:42,020
as it stands if the paper is

496
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:46,230
essentially cited yesterday okay

497
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:50,830
was a more he's a leading case that
would like to see more

498
00:31:50,830 --> 00:31:56,480
a desolate at couple questions oil your
area to get my first question was good

499
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,550
was really a penalty up penny

500
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,879
here how much rain did they get on it

501
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,950
or just an observation number two a

502
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,970
he was in there a year two years I wish
that he had a lot of data and so

503
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:16,530
unit were okay up paper include

504

is I would like to see you know

505
00:32:20,070 --> 00:32:24,429
table today graph/chart similar lipset
is animated

506
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:28,140
other aspects like looking for false
alarm if you do it here

507
00:32:28,140 --> 00:32:31,380
the contribution is partially you know

508
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:35,270
just get methodology thing getting more

509
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:39,580
appropriate or miss or will be well

510
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:42,550
aidid and conclusions UK our a

511
00:32:42,550 --> 00:32:45,760
is lead methodological

512
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,240
application your cell so okay

513
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:53,050
dated we have a raw deal

514
00:32:53,050 --> 00:32:56,200
slow precise I made charts

515
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:00,640
or a and did you give me an analyst up
to date like I said no doubt that

516
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:04,170
yes or the informal que se are

517
00:33:04,170 --> 00:33:07,540
in the resort in one case study Hong

518
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:10,710
and %uh you know you know

519
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:14,560
the and houses %um

520
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:18,330
unique Blazey rain go are

521
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:21,490
every direction reflection on the
operations of the hell

522
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:25,270
I mean we were not waiting down-home

523
00:33:25,270 --> 00:33:29,520
detail productivity day lol or document
workflow

524
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,710
or things like that not they yeah I know

525
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,420
or point was to understand what the hell
prime

526
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:40,450
and how they needed that it worked alone
probably but you just that

527
00:33:40,450 --> 00:33:43,820
and army to completely contradictory

528
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:48,330
me that is here now well not it going

529
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:53,080
charging rash is what I'm saying you can
contact Paul

530
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:56,310
it did not appear data you have a
million a

531
00:33:56,310 --> 00:34:00,050
that being a min remotely and now but
let me just down

532
00:34:00,050 --> 00:34:03,480
I read your paper not another year but I
either

533
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:07,390
have not a private were either this in
an opportunity yet

534
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:12,200
okay I I don't know exactly how to deal
with that

535
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:16,189
as a saying the you brought him home are
are not

536
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:19,610
when their game well I

537
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:23,940
or what we've got conclusions from our
index basically what we do

538
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:27,320
all year yeah on wounded

539
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:30,800
hell measures on how long it will

540
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,390
carry of problems by hand and how long
it took

541
00:34:34,389 --> 00:34:38,199
carrying on with who'll and that a in
the

542
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:42,428
it isn't there but that's just the same
number I managed to do that

543
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:45,490
on wilhelm that

544
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:49,668
and the process begins right baby loss
that have to be done

545
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:56,668
I is described as a reported

546
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,240
movie hah

547
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,899
also know problems wide the

548
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:08,690
mothers into offering the outcome

549
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:12,630

569
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:32,140
back but and not give the Rondo he
should be an ideal semiconductor

570
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:35,650
irons so I think would be most helpful
he has my his

571
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:39,760
mentes & you know adjacent ass

572
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,420
there there's another because this is a
decision-making prop

573
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:46,690
I'll interaction who worked with who
have written

574
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:51,069
high-minded kicking your butt hole or
whether there is anything important

575
00:36:51,069 --> 00:36:52,069
leaving work

576
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:55,829
collision from each other within eight
with you know soft and that

577
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,959
that is operation even I no

578
00:36:58,959 --> 00:37:03,629
and only you know the people of each
other much less after

579
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:06,779
on KSL mark potter

580
00:37:06,779 --> 00:37:10,069
so you don't want to I have all over

00:37:13,799 --> 00:37:18,059
does I he has plaque time they have also
what it is

583
00:37:18,059 --> 00:37:21,859
well his largely I'll

584
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:25,078
specializing in this very small
operation leader

585
00:37:25,079 --> 00:37:28,729
for hours and I'll writer on

586
00:37:28,729 --> 00:37:32,379
and I so over the routine work

587
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:36,049
no routine work yes headed to the diet

588
00:37:36,049 --> 00:37:39,769
does that big game on time and

589
00:37:39,769 --> 00:37:43,499
we didn't get involved rightly you know

590
00:37:43,499 --> 00:37:46,618
the million all rare age

591
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:50,449
up that happened with her handle I'll
mostly

592
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:54,369
we have Press there okay so

593
00:37:54,369 --> 00:37:57,769
moms in a subdivision as a

594
00:37:57,769 --> 00:38:00,988
something else that nasa here race

595
00:38:00,989 --> 00:38:04,229
questionnaires human many

596
00:38:04,229 --> 00:38:05,210
same

597
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:08,269
I so

598
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:12,140
when things inside this

599
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:17,808
com here but though

600
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:21,749
so loving little studies group

601
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:28,049
by who changed

602
00:38:28,049 --> 00:38:31,190
well on and I is another question I had
a sec

603
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:34,269
there's another line place to use

604
00:38:34,269 --> 00:38:37,578
see this similarities me you provide

605
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:41,079
hooligans of environment to you people
wrong

606
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:44,269
or way well

607
00:38:44,269 --> 00:38:48,209
or on someone Excel

608
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,210
notta lotta are

609
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:54,789
literature aren't my views stockdale are
all

610
00:38:54,789 --> 00:39:00,029
our overall it was a good ball and I was
that he spent some time

611
00:39:00,029 --> 00:39:03,390
a drug tunnel point you know

612
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:07,180
was just going wat reading writing here

613
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,930
suck yet Islam yeah

614
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:15,640
his he says

615
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:19,879
or yes that s yes he's

616
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:24,359
we will move early apparently that it is

617
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:27,700
very interesting day because I'm

618
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,990
burn be out on st.

619
00:39:31,990 --> 00:39:35,140
a priorities that higher are or

620
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:39,890
pledge and he's been

621
00:39:39,890 --> 00:39:43,440
time to find out the hierarchy and Zach
organizations

622
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:48,160
and our operation has been the most are
the ones that we are involved

623
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:51,868
are not in our you know they are
stand-alone is

624
00:39:51,869 --> 00:39:55,339
up for the most part and and so

625
00:39:55,339 --> 00:39:59,480
I have been a little bit concerned about
what they learn because they seem

626
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:04,150
talk about how will the real power
formulations of applying at No will

627
00:40:04,150 --> 00:40:05,390
actually experienced

628
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,900
with mining building and no and saucer

629
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,260
so so I'm no we'll see where that goes

630
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:15,290
but my gut feeling is it's going on

631
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:21,619
direction may not interviews so many

632
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:24,829
you never really good suggestions terms

633
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:28,359
so information reply in that paper

634
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,230
the observations food and I think I

635
00:40:32,230 --> 00:40:37,790
comment as into that and one suggestion
I as if you can write that information

636
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:40,549
that rights a greater me to the paper
and I

637
00:40:40,549 --> 00:40:43,989
uncertain mint minus amid many how much

638
00:40:43,989 --> 00:40:49,029
but who is version the jewel explanation
you know and this is another

639
00:40:49,029 --> 00:40:53,319
the Argentine politician but my guess is
you publishes you any

640
00:40:53,319 --> 00:40:57,969
your service yes conference people who
raise in that order

641
00:40:57,969 --> 00:41:02,660
because I know primary little but given
that extra information

642
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,729
probably the big one the biggest
absolutely resume really minimize the

643
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:09,569
discussion with the old as you were
giving

644
00:41:09,569 --> 00:41:12,849
here you mentioned it was is really just

645
00:41:12,849 --> 00:41:16,059
as ID element this actual research so

646
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:20,400
it with him being that way in the paper
and

647
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,119
sorry mention well you know as an aside
I we help them out with his little butt

648
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:29,199
the name world as providing greater
trust among

649
00:41:29,199 --> 00:41:34,489
try so i i think that could potentially
be

650
00:41:34,489 --> 00:41:38,309
operated by I think that is i think
thats Perry Hall

651
00:41:38,309 --> 00:41:41,619
I you know I think one of the reasons
why I'm

652
00:41:41,619 --> 00:41:44,699
we didn't pull in

653
00:41:44,699 --> 00:41:47,929
here information on how they handle him

654
00:41:47,929 --> 00:41:51,319
in there is that just as I think

655
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:54,369
who owns my heart thing you know 1 you
know

656
00:41:54,369 --> 00:41:58,729
great the particulars are not want that
much

657
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:03,598
on you we have experience

658
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:05,190
again a waterway

659
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:09,420
chance of being here we had one sample
when we started working on display

660
00:42:09,420 --> 00:42:13,700
and I we all knew it was not at all

661
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:18,290
and I'm doing a hell why don't ring

662
00:42:18,290 --> 00:42:21,420
so it actually do some comparison

663
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:24,550
I were close programs that work in their

664
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:28,849
I'm not sure that's from individual or
all yeah absolutely

665
00:42:28,849 --> 00:42:32,220
really myisha money kill

666
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:36,200
in the periphery labor and Irish Lions
are

667
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,980
right number why I don't know what you
can do with no

668
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:45,050
so is not II winner is not so much

669
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:49,280
worrying about her spare so numbers sort
of remember

670
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,609
unionism way anyone on

671
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:58,069
you know here all so probable reserves
they only have that one trial

672
00:42:58,069 --> 00:43:01,470
and maybe later in their life goals are
going to stand out and

673
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:04,640
for drug trafficking but he is

674
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,529
I'm as i said i kno apologists I'm only
speaking as someone who was friends or

675
00:43:09,530 --> 00:43:10,800
other malicious

676
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:12,310
I

677
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:15,480
yeah it is giving this story in the
community

678
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,160
and it started playing you know sitting
here and

679
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:22,620
on exacted my on your own guns from me

680
00:43:22,620 --> 00:43:28,140
paths you're sitting there is everybody

681
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:32,299
bananas and how they even as great as

682
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,410
on for more performances from incident
response to that happens that's all

683
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:41,430
sure you know information interesting
information about that

684
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,660
prime because then we can write a you go
to buy

685
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:49,859
potentially another anthropologist
arrest yes researcher will go and do not

686
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:50,590
is up

687
00:43:50,590 --> 00:43:53,760
no i well he saw what happened in this
trial

688
00:43:53,760 --> 00:44:00,640
but this trial is even has upside down
what's up with that

689
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:04,460
so that's already useful in many

690
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:10,730
souls

691
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:14,940
he did not Alonso harlins man it's not
just the engineer

692
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:19,090
number on colleges Barack done several

693
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:22,120
well studies in my room

694
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:25,819
well mostly on interviews and well

695
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:29,250
said a dog is that I release also

696
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,910
guys that you don't have a lot of dated

697
00:44:32,910 --> 00:44:36,970
analyze the way we you valuable

698
00:44:36,970 --> 00:44:40,959
or 10 or auto

699
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:45,820
yeah I love it now you're not talking
about structuring

700
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:49,610
I just gave an example from my own
experience be

701
00:44:49,610 --> 00:44:52,920
interview with which we get data you
have

702
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:58,000
somebody decides for two-year you should
have hated that you've done

703
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,390
call not only should build code or no

704
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,220
right not you you mean that in a year I
believe the external people

705
00:45:06,220 --> 00:45:09,970
well I'll calling I'm

706
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:15,680
looking for pattern does gladiators of

707
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:20,810
opening someone I here

708
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:24,770
only ever said it was it is being
brought to bear

709
00:45:24,770 --> 00:45:29,910
years I

710
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,390
community so normally what are you
seeing

711
00:45:33,390 --> 00:45:39,410
first I you have no hope of going to be
really good

712
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,640
like everybody is kind you know
traditional

713
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:47,270
settings on yes we're planning a day you
will have his

714
00:45:47,270 --> 00:45:51,160
any you know me the idea that someone
can harm

715
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:54,330

716
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:57,650

720
00:46:07,499 --> 00:46:10,640
om yeppers row

721
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,739
I mister houses and then that sets the
stage for a more comprehensive

722
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:21,309
yeah I think you are exactly right and
is it a fraud

723
00:46:21,309 --> 00:46:25,369
it I age well here's to work brother is

724
00:46:25,369 --> 00:46:28,420
in Asian any problem where she

725
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:31,449
so it was very they well

726
00:46:31,449 --> 00:46:36,239
so I think it's something I seeing not
so much solicitations that

727
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:39,929
there'd sometimes computer and

728
00:46:39,929 --> 00:46:43,789
only hood what you think

729
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:47,719
very well you produce process his

730
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:54,719
finding something good going to be a
little bit quality his

731
00:46:54,789 --> 00:46:58,009
thinking about I useful method

732
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:01,279
and I have seen I didn't say own

733
00:47:01,279 --> 00:47:04,609
you know this is reproducible it right
every you know

734
00:47:04,609 --> 00:47:07,670
trick in the book right isn't it funny
and

735
00:47:07,670 --> 00:47:12,709
I think hoodlum you use as many

736
00:47:12,709 --> 00:47:16,109
get and gave an excellent

737
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:21,249
say your observation because in fact we
don't

738
00:47:21,249 --> 00:47:24,738
central it when rival player and

739
00:47:24,739 --> 00:47:26,710
positions we love it

740
00:47:26,710 --> 00:47:30,540
and was often we're not seeing the same

741
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:34,109
exact problem law in

742
00:47:34,109 --> 00:47:37,770
what we report here and I wouldn't by
Henry C

743
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:41,170
I right well you never know

744
00:47:41,170 --> 00:47:44,619
whose in historian

745
00:47:44,619 --> 00:47:49,589
related cross you'll that's important

746
00:47:49,589 --> 00:47:53,020
being will die him the older

747
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:56,849
well I we will burden here whose

748
00:47:56,849 --> 00:48:01,000
11 process whose

749
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,349
to probably wouldn't

750
00:48:04,349 --> 00:48:07,550
be to learn the problem

751
00:48:07,550 --> 00:48:11,020
well what does this lovers

752
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:15,070
your you do use

753
00:48:15,070 --> 00:48:18,670
long approach by the withdrew her

754
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:22,580
I'm sorry hero the for

755
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:26,000
Lucy you know prison

756
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:30,440
Lucy a juror him

757
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:34,060
I or on her about our good

758
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:37,860
so there are examples there I'll appears
you

759
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,000
the really similar approaches than

760
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:44,280
like that where are you Parliament

761
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:48,490
world thing will be pretty much doing
well

762
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:52,240
what is it about movie pulses me that
much

763
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:55,299
I will me much could be drawn

764
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:58,610
the second book so knows it

765
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:03,530

00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,640
will be sold she

769
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,640
for some reason incomprehensible here's

770
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:22,779
here you go followed by Richard

771
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:26,670
horse or I agree when

772
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:30,260
anyone lovely ok all 100 books

773
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:34,090
way the written about this

774
00:49:34,090 --> 00:49:36,590
the Cup me Ridge

775
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,830
I don't know what it is you'd like

776
00:49:39,830 --> 00:49:43,069
aren't you big him the

777
00:49:43,070 --> 00:49:46,940
works OK world just 100

778
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,000
me you my we

779
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,980
cokie here you something

780
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,290
you up want to get the message out who
don't you want

781
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:03,140
one approach that's a good idea that you
know is

782
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:06,180
I think it's terribly rent

783
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:13,180
a hat we have a moral obligation bro
well

784
00:50:13,430 --> 00:50:18,049
0 the community with him

785
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:22,770
million communication which 3 the you
are absolutely

786
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:25,890
so while you order the order

787
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:29,259
moves on and this year on those

788
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:32,520
and so close like his balls

789
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:37,080
do you miss to lose him

790
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:43,790
rooms

791
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:47,130
many more using

792
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,930
so

793
00:50:50,930 --> 00:50:54,470
a I'm understand

794
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:58,529
kid outside want

795
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:02,100
hopefuls locks so we'll see

796
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:06,420
goals he would

797
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:10,180
you weigh process Pittsford

798
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,470
parton's old

799
00:51:13,470 --> 00:51:17,500
result will be doing old

800
00:51:17,500 --> 00:51:21,010
whose point people

801
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:24,250
solvent

802
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:28,150
rescissions his sites

803
00:51:28,150 --> 00:51:31,620
its rear all do so

804
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:35,640
