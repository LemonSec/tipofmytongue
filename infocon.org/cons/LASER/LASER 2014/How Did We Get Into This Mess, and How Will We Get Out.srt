2
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:21,240
seventies records handout

3
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,159

00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:38,220
acid into perspective so i meeting you

8
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,690

to handle it

9
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,390
did and one cagney guess and Samuel

10
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,480
in the same but for and disrespected
funny

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,510
so its were thinking about

12
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:57,640
you know Tyler inside all day long all

13
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,380
why is it exactly know do it and

14
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,589
revisiting had a good and bad Sony
decided

15
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:08,090
science is her I and a

16
00:01:08,090 --> 00:01:11,850
her injury dangling diamond earrings
were

17
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:16,600
areas is hanging you know could be
considered more like uses many years ago

18
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,780
are no and are they in our lives all

19
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,190
army course are minor in

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,470
do all the things that you every single
day online if the

21
00:01:26,470 --> 00:01:30,780
could be a juror's he remarked that and

22
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:35,940
I also wanna by I think science is
really about developing and rings

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,509
here's fine

24
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:41,520
people and the better procedures out and
I'll

25
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,100
after no and more understanding

26
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,289
have the moment right moral actually
take

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,860
healer but this won't be the long-term
investment

28
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:56,200
citizens and your process you only hear
it

29
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,440
pass you have to make certain that
long-term not possible in just

30
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:04,120
you know ASA a really great as ice

31
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,020
hear someone you know here's why I'm
gonna do this it is only the hospital

32
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,370
only time after the downside

33
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:16,910
alzheimer's years cost billion dollar

34
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:20,340
here and are problem is that

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,010
don't understand the basic principles
that analyzed

36
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,959
and if you don't understand mace
Actelion

37
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:31,650
he have a rap song this problem and
reduce

38
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,770
him demands years alright

39
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,770
calendar

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,609
who on re: him

41
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,720
people with low

42
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,970
well I wasn't no three hours depending
on the way

43
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:57,370
is the emerging here in the system
iraq's prime

44
00:02:57,370 --> 00:03:01,569
created all sub-par ass and put them all
together

45
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:05,708
yet which is actually one being acting
anything that

46
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:11,319
or K but you don't really understand why
it hasn't things happen case

47
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:16,108
the base are only have

48
00:03:16,109 --> 00:03:20,690
with I'm you covered

49
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:24,069

through work on to use see

56
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,120
does one came up

57
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,050
alone see Hughes

58
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,900
hood like one

59
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,400
wherever use

60
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,970
or him what his

61
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:10,290
I'll particularly rules

62
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:15,440
him/her so I would

63
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,480
you know I'm

64
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,180
%um at

65
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,500
is probably worth pointing out that you
know here's

66
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,890
there is an issue what mindset no

67
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:32,770
went great you have to understand why is
that

68
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:35,810
all and I'm bringing back his interest
place

69
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:39,150
his either other back that mister

70
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:44,260
so don't think that will happen is that
we haven't really seen any

71
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,830
castro here and I would answer

72
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:51,289
say again that I don't think the
understand really

73
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:54,920
one session that like all amino that

74
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:58,190
and I think that iraqis yes

75
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,360
here a

76
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,250
is UNITE HERE his eyes major have an
understanding

77
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,840
I was how something like this heard so

78
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,390
and let him down my trying to fix
perspective

79
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:18,800
a on why I think that business and

80
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,230
and out and just a little bit about I'm
a six-year hill and

81
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,340
are No

82
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,380
and up morning and

83
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:31,930
standing on my your guys over hex

84
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:35,280
feel that same has burial not know

85
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,830
and inside all he's so all

86
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:42,300
I you saying what it is that you know

87
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:45,560
guys handing it out mom to

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:50,200
I don't think I hit me up on me yes
where everybody can participate

89
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,260
is inherently yes as a

90
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:56,640
I'm just because there are more
academics out there

91
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:59,849
there are good jobs tactics yet

92
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:03,020
and the this guy's ass

93
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:08,799
is you burgers me and this is what
really opens up doors and increases the

94
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,700
options

95
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:15,020
so I am very youu things like

96
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,799
said he editor greater or you want it

97
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,970
him and warm compress you want

98
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:27,310
funding iight or even you know the big
one in public

99
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:30,330
bears that one really Macy's yeah

100
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:35,310
Las papers lost aviators and

101
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,130
academic slow you think ourselves at
rough games

102
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:42,600
it's a raffle soldiers stanley steamer

103
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,100
to 10 degrees or and I think

104
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,810
harlem problem that we have is that
these are misguided

105
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:54,290
so much said about politics as much as
possible which is necessary

106
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:57,520
at this E ever

107
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,979
liotta we're also concerned about two
things like breaking

108
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:05,378
bankers and bringing work done many as
possible

109
00:07:05,379 --> 00:07:11,500
right so I'll here a meeting are you see
this is something we're

110
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,509
to rate him 4 looking for a while

111
00:07:14,509 --> 00:07:18,009
better you you make it harder for
everybody else yeah

112
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,720
black do and

113
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,889
also your you're trying to do the bare
minimum

114
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:29,190
to get your paper accepted writers be
after

115
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:32,310
are the course better yours

116
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,530
who are other acting and

117
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,960
the problem really like him back his
minimum standards

118
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:43,729
Armenia and you know what is almost like

119
00:07:43,729 --> 00:07:46,789
if you care about academics Milano

120
00:07:46,789 --> 00:07:50,130
yourself you hear people say things like
this right

121
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:53,479
only opening offices in a month all-star

122
00:07:53,479 --> 00:07:58,068
something on their you will set up a
little shopping around

123
00:07:58,069 --> 00:08:03,919

126
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,919

possible

127
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:20,008

128
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:24,130
service community at large your own
start work

129
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,810
a month before you're gonna try okay
it's probably not

130
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,140
your a in your shopping papers around

131

your hiney

132

here mission that your papers probably
not all that great

133
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,430
because you have to try to guess that
your viewers the right there

00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:41,780
jerseys a little bit of well as long we
have situations like

165
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:45,640
review which thinking in some situations
ballad

166
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:49,360
for example you have a

167
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,230
well we have the S&P anecdote from
earlier

168
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:56,640
where there was too much information
about that although he

169
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,150
reproducibility don't know or but I know
there was a number of other

170
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:04,819
workshops at his leisure we what's that
sorta

171
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:10,170
information so easily the shopping
around is primarily

172
00:11:10,170 --> 00:11:14,219
not so much because they're making
judgments are

173
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,110
we can hear any they're hoping that the
reviewer is understand

174
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:21,749
what they're trying to get across the
new research because you have no based

175
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:22,740
methodology

176
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:26,319
virgin quality hollinger yet as a

177
00:11:26,319 --> 00:11:33,319
her gonna up level him said

178
00:11:33,779 --> 00:11:37,370
or him so

179
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:42,430
in my mind a I'll it was added back to
the bare minimum standards that

180
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:46,069
you know they don't want a his eyes

181
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:51,229
and for the most part and you leaders
like thats other

182
00:11:51,230 --> 00:11:55,149
and you know as john mentioned here this
morning

183
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:58,610
this can cause situation where
researchers his

184
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:03,470
a lot of time and money building up at
work he example

185
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:07,040
up or where hood where

186
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,219
a lot people is that a lot I'm building
of or

187
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:14,790
that all and it also I think much harder

188
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:18,389
discredit bad either and stuff here in
the first place

189
00:12:18,389 --> 00:12:22,709
because as you know something it's the
latter user me

190
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:26,579
a lot more generous forming this message
rather than

191
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:30,059
sir all at you know during interview

192
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,199
and also argue and it is

193
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,589
louanne after I'll here but I don't
think that

194
00:12:37,589 --> 00:12:42,100
there's not any allegations i think is
really overwhelming

195
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:44,800
the academic system was designed

196
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,459
and the reason I say that is because
there is

197
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:51,200
out travels a lot it's a lot of people
are

198
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,420
a lot and some people are saying is and
you know

199
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:57,420
gaming approaches a to try to shot

200
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:02,599
rare aircraft take happened after and he
did that

201
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:06,740
it was very hard for editors and more
here

202
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:11,340
find viewers for all neighbors and no

203
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:14,930
all where you end up with people who are
you

204
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:18,500
neighbors who are standing up alright
actually

205
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,640
thoroughly understand papers about and
figure out what they're not

206
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:26,100
or and oftentimes what I see is that
well

207
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:30,060
you have faster interview dollars in
grants

208
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,880
and I have practice for trying to you

209
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:37,210
over exactly in her second year trying
to write

210
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:41,190
interviews and you really now have a

211
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:47,360
or were you were where they were and I
think the solution is also have

212
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,250
prism all a is actually is a

213
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,310
boeing is fewer I on all occasions

214
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:58,489
well he is to raise this bar let the
minimum standards

215
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:01,510
involving decides and

216
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:05,680
I think this is for narrowly that
there's a pressure every academic

217
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:09,500
was fast all polish as much as all
native Mike

218
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,970
act ahora go girl and no

219
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:16,280
he's forget that they're supposed to be
pressure which is

220
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:19,709
I you should also do next or I

221
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:23,460
and i cant lost a little bit because we
were fighting over so much three

222
00:14:23,460 --> 00:14:26,510
because we're trying egos and bass I
think

223
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:31,260
problem that we have right now is our
house brings much happiness is like

224
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,130
going fast not gonna

225
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:36,760
I'm all celebrities

226
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:39,890
the question upgrade well i where entire

227
00:14:39,890 --> 00:14:42,980
well I business for reasons the firmware

228
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:47,070
lot education and this to me is

229
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:50,920
having trouble problem that I think
science is not really on the cover

230
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,380
going back to school at least not your
size and

231
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,590
I I have I think we have what I

232
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,900
Altieri all or you know I'm riders

233
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:06,600
teachers supposedly who never got home
they were in rats

234
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,020
all I inside as a result here

235
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:14,449
holly is no his as an hour and a half
this

236
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,520
cycle a areas away

237
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,680
there's also apply to a stand-up problem
still make

238
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,870
I'll that is by how much me

239
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:28,250
yeah I think you're not lying you know
where he is

240
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,110
great the gym the matter is oftentimes
hundred-yard dash

241
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:36,690
line try I'm gonna figure out but
whatever your paper

242
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,090
are you guessed Eileen when you serve
Him because their something people here

243
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,370
feel and that means that if

244
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,570
I is really a racist and for you and I

245
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:51,640
i angry because I at tractor maker

246
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:55,470
wife overly hard paper all

247
00:15:55,470 --> 00:15:58,910
out you're gonna find it is China's me

248
00:15:58,910 --> 00:16:04,000
and the next time you're in with my
fingers well and other

249
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,440
and in the day doing this tit-for-tat

250
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:11,750
will suffer but everybody else is not be
held to a higher standard

251
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:17,370
gonna have a lot of success problems
that you don't have any right back

252
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:20,840
and some him consular

253
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:26,010
and related guidelines for I'm not 0 I'm
actually up

254
00:16:26,010 --> 00:16:29,380
and outside and what probably happened

255
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:32,439
your size at least that you don't have
really any quality

256
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,610
on blast okay so I want morality sacks

257
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:38,930
I like it right I don't think there's
anything something

258
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:43,680
what is a allegedly you and I'll

259
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:46,989
many no estás

260
00:16:46,990 --> 00:16:50,940
right ultimately your researchers

261
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:54,510
fun and armies don't tell us that any

262
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:59,240
K dollars applies mister bus we have
Little Mermaid

263
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:04,510
K so in terms of addressing these issues
I think

264
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:07,839
per se obviously all to invest a lot who

265
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,790
all education

266
00:17:08,790 --> 00:17:12,010
resolution and you must be mandatory
training

267
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:17,410
greatly going through here size to know
what exactly is science

268
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:21,830
widely her doing it how do you but also

269
00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:25,560
say well have been greatly about his not
just our own

270
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,590
but also others at home here

271
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:35,590
others saying that research his research
to rate this

272
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:39,080
LA I think what we need is that
investment

273
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:42,540
academic capital parallel political
battle

274
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,720
that is really rational in many ways

275
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,810
here an extra spring standards he has a
a victory

276
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:56,669
now the well a your contract you do all
this stuff to make a lawmaker details

277
00:17:56,670 --> 00:17:57,400
goes wrong

278
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,620
third esters that are are here polish

279
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:03,709
you know exactly where is your career by
not

280
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:08,370
happening more research is those who has
acted

281
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,459
capital that seniors all like

282
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,640
using hers either are entertainer

283
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,920
happens here mortgage servicers they're
the ones who can really stand up and say

284
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:22,160
I'll we we've been working on this for a
while

285
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:25,880
I don't think we're doing this the right
way we need yeah and

286
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,980
any were backfire there standing

287
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,820
away is not at you don't much care

288
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:37,240
here's our grace it takes 10 as
guidelines

289
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,340
at doing great at checklists for what
his eyes

290
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:45,149
and understand that what constitutes
science might be different

291
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:50,420
and Paris hey we don't like that

292
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:55,730
this checklist guidelines to the ground
here we have hired

293
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:58,950
to make sure that is based on scientific
quality

294
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,960
more and also

295
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,520
the night her attitude and a only to
foster

296
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:10,570
culture are excited were because when I
think about whether you have to rate and

297
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:10,980
review

298
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:15,440
forms that i've seen I asked questions
like I wasn't allowed to wear

299
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,480
work is work now I'll there

300
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,010
and I know other times I San Diego

301
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:25,590
10 I don't know what constitutes

302
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:28,750
not know I don't know lot

303
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,780
like to wear I

304
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:35,129
these guidelines say okay well we're
looking at work

305
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:39,120
who were is AT&T and then look

306
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,439
working as a i cnt I don't he

307
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,250
so anything you know I back the author
you have to be

308
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,980
writing is some framework wish to get
him back to others

309
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,000
hey I

310
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:56,050
trade-up are doing all this better said

311
00:19:56,050 --> 00:19:59,370
row has established earlier and somehow

312
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:01,928
I think we need to lower the expectation
on the net

313
00:20:01,929 --> 00:20:05,070
fingers and maybe this is really just
hugh

314
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,119
right any the number for that oversee

315
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:11,309
that you need to have maybe that's not

316
00:20:11,309 --> 00:20:15,100
really reality but his third
interception and thats

317
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:20,240
you know namely just change the
perception and finally

318
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:24,230
to get him to those that wait are I
think we need some changes

319
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:27,679
bunnies because ultimately they say
scanners

320

researchers are all in to funny force
and

321
00:20:31,749 --> 00:20:35,450
if we're told that target as knows any

things correctly you don't get the right
guy commanders

326
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:52,539
I mean a lot are working researchers

327
00:20:52,539 --> 00:20:56,100
have her sadly been doing the wrong
thing

328
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:59,889
not because malice them because they
were never topped the right pro

329
00:20:59,889 --> 00:21:03,379
day ever gonna you after undertaking
thorough

black science bird his black I

444
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:14,230
failure is partly due to a lack sign who
like here

445
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:18,750
marvel at how big do you like but we

00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:28,840
labor market so y que row partly

449
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,918
increasing the probability we have rock
failure

450
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,320
you don't know writer caucus thing I'll

451

you have experienced whoever's I

452
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:43,269
not so obvious we believe it happened

453
00:28:43,269 --> 00:28:46,629
who and the people right not here no

454
00:28:46,629 --> 00:28:50,309
is policy ground they investing

455
00:28:50,309 --> 00:28:54,039
is not buy me a disease the invest are

456
00:28:54,039 --> 00:28:57,240
or you know about trees all

457
00:28:57,240 --> 00:29:00,279
that and it was not a record

458
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:04,169
with all so soaker nobody

459
00:29:04,169 --> 00:29:07,759
powerful or think that happen no worry

460
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:11,419
right now I'll

461
00:29:11,419 --> 00:29:15,000
you know we have that is become so

462
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,490
I nobody

463
00:29:17,490 --> 00:29:20,090
or right and so you know

464
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,730
we we a small wrong about 10 years ago

465
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:28,179
as ordinary happen I

466
00:29:28,179 --> 00:29:33,650
everything long so we have all

467
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:37,350
for others the inherent on homework

468
00:29:37,350 --> 00:29:40,549
are know there's a problem we know

469
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:44,340
of my tactical we talk about it every
day

470
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:47,899
when that happens with academia

471
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:51,500
is funny who is are

472
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:55,799
and the problem is not at all we
actually

473
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:59,500
so he's got a little bit about

474
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:03,440
I'll the very home heating element

475
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,049
as a very strange I'll my eyes go

476
00:30:07,049 --> 00:30:12,970
on a call that happened where they were
not able to make a deal

477
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,030
work power going off

478
00:30:16,030 --> 00:30:21,030
your rebounds it 101-100 out

479
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:25,360
right now of course sorry at any better
than this number

480
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,490
and anybody who challenged the number no

481
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:31,710
for are hey hey

482
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:33,040
that we should come in

483
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:36,700
talk about I'll better Rafferty right

484
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:41,850
and there's anything I think nothing
wrong there actually already

485
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,740
sounds good feeling better after cheaper
say

486
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:50,350
call her massive or that was the for and
what happened was

487
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,030
the whole truth see discuss place fire

488
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:58,510
here is a hey I'm worried about this the
more the issue

489
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:01,920
comes on his we call then and

490
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,970
me all failure on range he said

491
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:09,570
group B for all that's why I think

492
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:13,700
thousand are I throughout wrong what
could be the problem

493
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,190
him down on her and mara keyword

494
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:20,190
DRR so

495
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:23,230
perished it happened over I

496
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:26,630
we were talking about trend over I we
have

497
00:31:26,630 --> 00:31:27,700
culture

498
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:31,610
change fundamentally solving the problem
with people

499
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,639
when he read to give his out quickly

500
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:38,790
of so we look at our

501
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,990
was I your we're gonna hear you

502
00:31:42,990 --> 00:31:47,200
wall chart a my exact right and there
were no I

503
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,030
his all along going on are

504
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:54,800
let all I'll decision

505
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,500
operators group plays their careers

506
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,580
on are up to trying

507
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,790
Rovers things are going gas for

508
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:08,180
or under previous 3 I'll

509
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:12,380
there was a tremendous pressure were big
companies solutions are already here

510
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:13,000
because

511
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,470
people are gone in the on the map we've
got get

thing that we arledge just about three
weeks ago

1012
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:47,310
we worked on it for a year hurt so I'm

1013
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:51,310
I don't with I was I am

1014
01:03:51,310 --> 01:03:54,920
my intention was not to be fatalistic

1015

optimistic about number things that make
you

1017
01:04:01,060 --> 01:04:04,670
change great but for we're thinking on
our

1018
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:07,800
both here about nature problem

1019

problems really going to be a

1021
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:18,440
barrier during good times and so

that were my

1024
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,839
really agree serious situation we read
it wrong

1025
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:35,000
because we're not doing we don't have to
practices that will enable us to do your

1026
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:35,609
research

1027
01:04:35,609 --> 01:04:40,009
