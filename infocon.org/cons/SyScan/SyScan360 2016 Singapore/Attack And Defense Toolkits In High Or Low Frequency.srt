1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,229
have no I don't gentleman and so here is
my presentation

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:13,250
it's about a higher low frequency attack
and defense took it so today I mentioned

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,289
before our presentation and it's more
about how to develop where it's less

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:25,939
about how to crack it so it might be a
little boring even though I graduated

5
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:32,590
from the morning on January University
and still a little rubbery and so I will

6
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:41,650
makes it as simple as I can ok so here
is my agenda and I started this

7
00:00:41,650 --> 00:00:48,370
presentation is combine all our works as
firms 8360 unicorn team smoke and we

8
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:55,570
focus on development and a in all the
hardware such as embedded device off

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:03,470
I'll go to System cars and our job is
guarantees a rarity Security office she

10
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:13,869
was sixty and we are ready to shower
wall rocks in telecom and data and about

11
00:01:13,869 --> 00:01:21,670
how to be a signal to how to sell and so
on so if you are interested as Jessica

12
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:29,749
White so that's about the french Foreign
you know they low-frequency and

13
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:37,689
high-frequency tax so how to get there
is a true ways and in low-frequency we

14
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:46,639
are you know there's Khamenei some key
card use government and in all there is

15
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:53,048
a smart card anime fair cost that's
already know about it so

16
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:05,500
2001 when you guys I don't know you do
you know about this and so let's just

17
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:13,980
skip to the US so this is a low
frequency attack and China we gotta go

18
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:21,899
to a neighbor and crawl and this towards
this to you can buy everywhere so if you

19
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:27,690
want to cry hard to justify it and in
all you put it under your president

20
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:36,940
button so it can't exactly say this is a
common but carries some SOCOM II into it

21
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:42,019
can it can burn false and it can change
the contact of your ID card so

22
00:02:42,019 --> 00:02:51,790
everything so if just account all this
juice can do is just a nice errors so I

23
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:59,590
was and I you know I want to access
system and I want to call ID card I want

24
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:05,380
I need to do is you know bring a laptop
on the brink are bringing car door and

25
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:11,329
you know of course I need a bad show you
some huge and it's not complicated so

26
00:03:11,329 --> 00:03:16,720
with as a developed a new hardware to
solve this problem and it's quite a

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,980
convenience just so you can you can now
access them with your family and with

28
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:32,709
the hardware that is so before we
introduce the details of this of this

29
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:41,610
hardware is done let's talk about how
CID access system works so this this is

30
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:50,269
the ideal accessory you know by ID card
ID card reader and the you know the

31
00:03:50,269 --> 00:03:57,030
controller and so fast and easy credit
card reader will send out of the carrier

32
00:03:57,030 --> 00:04:04,430
signals by the attending a carrier
frequency is about one hundred and

33
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:07,580
twenty-five the second these articles

34
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:17,500
reach the ID card readers working area
so so the restaurant which is made up of

35
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:27,650
competence and received the erotic
novels so ready for a continued to fast

36
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,039
motor or generator generator that powers
sittercity signals under the system

37
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:40,370
clock by this signal so severe disease
chip so that only the chip will really

38
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,660
the serial numbers from storage and as a
dedicated and their editors 000 number

39
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:52,740
all the carriers acknowledged by the
feds Mull regulating Cody and send it

40
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,930
back to the reader so I don't last this
reader we would emulate undergoes a

41
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:04,970
number of comparative data base and they
choose to open a door or not so much a

42
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,990
smashing of our production which he was
nominated the heck I'd approach to 430

43
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:20,050
weight as you know make some metal
badges 22 2011 to clone so this is the

44
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:27,200
first of all and all it can do is just
you know putting the card and the

45
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:34,990
carburetor so whether crises is working
this storage the signals are

46
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:38,510
communicated between the car on the
counter reader so his death

47
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:47,940
owners so you can change the serial
number and leave you know that he has

48
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:58,870
more than 20 this is the second one is
ours is ours so this one it can I mean

49
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:04,590
what do you want to and you can put a
serial number into and a president you

50
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:13,340
know President Biden and the only thing
you and so this is the

51
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:20,889
little bit of it can burn the caliber
furs and you know the only thing you can

52
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:26,379
do is just you know about 200 number is
important so we just developers a server

53
00:06:26,379 --> 00:06:32,620
the server thing is the heck I deeper
and so way earlier and plugging your

54
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:39,860
phone and we also connected the app and
we would hype

55
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:50,870
what we want and you can perform over
all the ID card hacking you know the the

56
00:06:50,870 --> 00:07:01,449
measure of all this matter is that I can
do so here is a detailed and added two

57
00:07:01,449 --> 00:07:11,860
models controlled by your apt and as you
can see her you can carry audio

58
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:23,039
connector so when you use heat can just
plug your phone by the audio in fact the

59
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,349
you know the hardware details in office
he hired April it doesn't matter so you

60
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:45,330
can just sit next to ok so I applied
temples is and you know you can read and

61
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:55,930
summarize all these protocols to cart it
will find out to all all this article

62
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:03,379
protocol is included in this basically
crude as he's 25 cents and so but if

63
00:08:03,379 --> 00:08:10,550
there is any see any protocol that we
already know yet it doesn't matter we

64
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:17,349
can record on replayed on does so you
can't do what he can do it all they look

65
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:23,930
for his card and a whatever he's managed
host coat and a USB phase code where

66
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,020
Murray

67
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:31,930
so while we do we use the audio
connector these ideas come from the

68
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:37,849
hijacker program program from the
Michigan University and you know you can

69
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:45,830
use power on about us so it's a power
and a decaying commuting head to between

70
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,560
your phone and the hardware

71
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:56,699
carries the original version of project
hygienic and it has also you know it

72
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:13,089
also has audio connector and they're so
proud of our 11 channel is used to

73
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:24,060
transfer data from the phone to my heart
so other updates as Mike East going

74
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,540
peace deals to change for data from the
Proteas so we designed this route to its

75
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:38,199
advantage for separate true makes this
the simulation voice signal adjusted to

76
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:44,649
the digital signal of the other
celebrity and audio signal after the

77
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:54,670
fountain has the PCBs so far this period
cuz he's iowan pass is Victor so it can

78
00:09:54,670 --> 00:10:02,949
connect to the compactor to get of the
digital signal and probably opt out of

79
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:19,860
the DART rail and after our top three
bears and Mike voice signal so so

80
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:28,609
serious ship ease the brain of
Heidelberg and can this country were all

81
00:10:28,610 --> 00:11:06,120
up and and you know as the club so large
storage story original signals so you

82
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:15,080
can play a referendum and as you can see
5 2010 heart beats so it's a pretty

83
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:26,589
pretty good it's pretty big if you just
want to record a voice again so is there

84
00:11:26,589 --> 00:11:38,850
are two hours by micro USB battery and
but as you can see I see as I see it in

85
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,800
the industry partners sorry and and 502
powers by both so while your battery and

86
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:56,640
in need to downgrade to 313 votes and
microUSB it so we should be opposes

87
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,500
server to operate your vote

88
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:14,100
8255 and all they see if RTC 3558 that's
why we use it it's quite ship and it's

89
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,360
easy to yours

90
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:24,880
so is it hardware aspirate the
underwriters occurred to me later or

91
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:32,370
secure and we can transistor under this
this this Agreement is wise how do we

92
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:45,420
get out of the parameters of the all the
elements that we use radar and chip to

93
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:48,310
them this demonstration

94
00:12:48,310 --> 00:13:03,489
chip 2008 model that has since from the
antenna design offices hi kar diya

95
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:09,170
person not quite complex could
complicate it saw all this notice all

96
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:15,250
the things you should notice it's the
digital and assimilation out and you

97
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:21,670
should I just 22 you're under the
judgment on tenor and do you know the

98
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:28,599
electron had a magnitude as that that's
all since you sure you should notice you

99
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:35,880
know if there's some designers your guys
you guys I believe all these things he's

100
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:46,880
quite easy to him after the hardware
design lets talk about their software

101
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:56,540
design and while you're the product is
quite pretty low power and as you so the

102
00:13:56,540 --> 00:14:01,760
more time we can use under the mall team
the heck I differ with standby

103
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:21,610
so we split the highest toll so quickly
it so we're required the carries a lot

104
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:29,059
of my ID card products such as a
high-tech of the year and as you can see

105
00:14:29,059 --> 00:14:37,160
that UK version so it's comedy using
china about 80% of our concern is also

106
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:49,199
used this product in China so just
quickly example of the protocol the 2k

107
00:14:49,199 --> 00:15:02,839
10 all these data base is 60 64 bits and
including I started as you can see I

108
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:12,529
just doesn't say that I don't need to
repair it and so when his club I Z when

109
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:19,569
there is an ID card is close to this
software will be where dem that easy

110
00:15:19,569 --> 00:15:28,699
125 125 Kandahar's signals so after
demolition under the security code this

111
00:15:28,699 --> 00:15:35,540
final day of final data that we got
where exactly the same as you can see

112
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:39,920
easy's lower pictures details about

113
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:53,729
80 this guys know about him I just go to
the the the writer and it means the one

114
00:15:53,730 --> 00:16:07,279
in north dakota and installing edges and
so so besides absolutely coats by the

115
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:15,240
mementos from met there will be there
will be some data parity-check so if you

116
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:25,410
want to go somewhere in the crowd at a
party other than an important and it's

117
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:36,079
only for guys to see it clearly doesn't
matter so what we want to assimilate her

118
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:45,529
car and it's the prison boys from the
radio so you can transfer the data into

119
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:51,579
the into these pictures from AD and I'm
sure you will

120
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:56,709
what is the lowest of the other North
debater

121
00:16:56,710 --> 00:17:06,329
of the of this this format and format
into from an individual man just called

122
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:17,199
and 8 bids so whether I see some ID card
Iraq needs and read out readout is this

123
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:23,680
image data signals and the approach for
us as a perforce function so what do you

124
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:31,140
what you need to do to you to increase
the idea and I don't put a major formats

125
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:43,780
so I want to cum hard as you can see as
we mentioned before there's a lot of the

126
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:55,700
masses that you know from the doctor I D
car so there's a bit of code under some

127
00:17:55,700 --> 00:18:01,030
general 80 factory letter word they use
but it doesn't matter decided cardoso

128
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:08,060
communism's we can just a recorded on
this story it's a story on the way we

129
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:18,550
needed to get out on the basis that's ok
so communication picture and routines

130
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:23,280
often and as it as it comes easy

131
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:29,550
differentials amendments code to compile
and compliance

132
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:42,280
communication between the a plan to head
to head the two and the value that I is

133
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:48,050
packing a little maggot so the
management just relying were reduced to

134
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:58,389
use this data bytes decoded data code
aids and a competitor competitor will be

135
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:00,710
used to transfer

136
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:09,830
simulator that drew the digital theater
and the delaware Dakota where these

137
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:18,720
matters to appear della flow and you
know the presidency is valid and as you

138
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,760
can see deal after channel yellow and
the right channel is named after the

139
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:37,200
competitor this is the new rule I never
lie so these chill if this very big

140
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:47,350
concedes the very depths of this picture
is all 672 and russia has denied entry

141
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:54,399
if you guys want to know about the house
so the committee communication between G

142
00:19:54,399 --> 00:20:03,090
four from the haggadah protrude is
similar to the apt to it's also the big

143
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:09,699
flow and the difference with the icy
fired earth and the way to remove the

144
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:18,490
Bears and the at whatever text me Mike
and use the ATM machines a sous quiet

145
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:27,470
it's quite easy and besides this might
be a lipid difficulty first is this is

146
00:20:27,470 --> 00:20:34,870
our first time your presentation but
don't worry we already uploaded all

147
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:37,510
these

148
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:47,129
may get up so you guys want to know that
deterrence presentations

149
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:54,390
time to crawl through our request under

150
00:20:54,390 --> 00:21:02,010
give the address on the Temple of Hera
Pheri

151
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:17,110
greater as it is

152
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:24,530
record right track so just a normal and
now it's a presbyter

153
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:32,660
only regard this is is this how it it
requiring

154
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:52,879
so when speaking to me this is
processing the data off the NRA down so

155
00:21:52,880 --> 00:22:02,850
long and a radio ad ID approved near the
courier you can see the context

156
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:15,150
so 11 we use the model

157
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:35,520
so you can see the digital changed and a
number on the screen so it means it can

158
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:43,070
read as a career as a contact out and
just trace similar to Barton and ass ok

159
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:51,280
simulators and workforce model so you
can just increase their idea and

160
00:22:51,280 --> 00:23:05,750
immediate out another time where you
want to talk about and want to cry just

161
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:19,890
a tad bit and she was always has tapped
so hairy and what about the future as

162
00:23:19,890 --> 00:23:25,190
you can see you can this is just a
little freakish hey it's just a

163
00:23:25,190 --> 00:23:31,340
low-frequency climbed a sniff and a
summit on board for us but we are trying

164
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:37,470
to outrun out our doing our job to
combines the high high frequency into it

165
00:23:37,470 --> 00:23:48,170
too long and hard to call another
thirty-point 30 points five six

166
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:57,560
megahertz discard all you know this is
here is the funny and romantic scenes as

167
00:23:57,560 --> 00:24:02,990
does germany made in Germany Germany
many

168
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:11,560
I think it's amazing but its terms you
should use our laptop is not comment on

169
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:17,600
the so we are trying to combine the
functions into the have had a pro and so

170
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:23,740
now you can just talking to us access
system with your phone under your lip

171
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:36,900
piercings and a laptop or tablet quite a
bit after the hike and its and Taliban

172
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:44,110
the high frequency the frequency and now
he's there is an appeal is called DMV

173
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:49,750
such as apple pie are about his
attorneys for the MB is the PBOC these

174
00:24:49,750 --> 00:25:00,160
people work and Sundays so easy to call
the house there is a lot of research

175
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:07,220
about is how to crawl on how to replace
a young record operate in china is much

176
00:25:07,220 --> 00:25:13,660
much simpler and it's quite an intense
quite easy because it only needs to look

177
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:22,530
at how to cross into Japan opinion and
it's quite such as a machine and not not

178
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:32,870
quite that easy but in China just made
under read all this out and hear such as

179
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:43,449
Eid your name or your burst person dead
and John are under the valid data only

180
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:51,280
and is not included a really doubt it
and you know I starr said the Amazon you

181
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,710
can tell you don't use a CVV

182
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,830
you can just use this information and
you can buy

183
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:06,590
everything what you want so it's quite
how how do you read this all this

184
00:26:06,590 --> 00:26:16,020
information so we've met a 222 rely out
but people use in excess of Sarah

185
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:25,320
so this is quite a comment but soul but
it's not it's not quite a comment all

186
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,860
it's not quite a cool thing so it
doesn't matter this readers and as a

187
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:40,300
result of this this is quite easy and I
saw it as a centre the commander with

188
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:48,480
the response and in care reform I S and
get all the information mentioned before

189
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:55,810
all this information is you can just get
it out in the area from ads and it's not

190
00:26:55,810 --> 00:27:06,659
included how why we don't use an access
all your phone with tmobile and we will

191
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:12,060
remain a reader so their power your
phone if you want to read our college

192
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:21,740
really cows and it's so you want to say
it's not quite a snot snot companions as

193
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:30,210
you know you're putting to prepare for a
near his pockets and besides the current

194
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:40,320
the carburetor I'm sorry that I think I
readers AC a lot of its part is it has a

195
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,659
big power but it should be used with the
laptop so it is still big I don't want

196
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:52,120
to hold my laptop to solve it

197
00:27:52,120 --> 00:28:00,340
it's much simpler than and as a way to
use or to chip in a white two radar when

198
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:03,379
you transfer the data and

199
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:14,180
receiver of the that's how I got this
young reader is a true to pass wider

200
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:21,230
radar and laser receiver receiver will
plug in your laptop or your ghetto did

201
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:30,530
you fall off and and if this were
transferred her from the reader and show

202
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:37,899
it off at all this is a serial port so
quiet it

203
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:47,320
classism the prison with quiet onda cero
control this device an account and a

204
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:54,990
connect to the tags you that's that's
absolutely zero chip it's our readership

205
00:28:54,990 --> 00:29:01,570
and up by the SPI protocol and we found
a rear command our fares the response

206
00:29:01,570 --> 00:29:07,520
and after all these things which has for
a response to your laptop that means to

207
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:15,820
your receiver so what are you can't get
such as if I want if I put this near to

208
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:22,250
my credit card and you can get as I
imagined credit card number provided

209
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:29,410
data under your idea number so you can
buy whatever you want

210
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:37,220
says that we use we put it into our
lives and as you can see you can say

211
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:43,970
nothing and so with all this message
will come out

212
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:54,119
so before we talked about his how to
attack us or let's talk about how to

213
00:29:54,119 --> 00:30:03,059
defend eight so very some some already
have some products to defend a defense

214
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:12,999
draw such a drive-by derided as there is
a little bit funny animal am an american

215
00:30:12,999 --> 00:30:20,919
product of them in our model car and I
don't know if you guys have some very

216
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:28,289
worried I might have the disease a guy I
met before and it's quite good but some

217
00:30:28,289 --> 00:30:38,970
of the other day when it is alright so
so many girls don't want to use this

218
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:48,859
this and besides they embark on these
amazing but the question is is

219
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:55,859
chargeable 2012 the battery of these
this product to need to do is just

220
00:30:55,859 --> 00:31:04,549
another one is quite sure that how we
will in madison parker defender to bed

221
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:12,100
at least a charmer and besides its
charitable besides the current

222
00:31:12,750 --> 00:31:17,870
this one holding to find that you know
the hyperposite but I can transfer the

223
00:31:17,870 --> 00:31:24,889
load so we combine these two functions
together it can't find low frequency and

224
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:33,090
a heart and a height of organs so it's
it's this present this product is much

225
00:31:33,090 --> 00:31:40,679
easier than a to protect we mentioned
before so it all the things it is hard

226
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:48,060
it had to be there if there is a reader
and if they're ok you know stand out to

227
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:55,330
the signals with nonsense and detergent
dammit so the major problem of this

228
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:04,199
product keys 10 while if this ends as
battery and you know if you don't want

229
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:16,140
to retire due to every day and how
sensitive that means if there might be

230
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:24,830
some but it's quiet there is always
drama generally always so your batteries

231
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:34,090
will be run out quickly and besides we
want to charge of also the show this to

232
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:42,720
their products you might be saying it's
all the same problem and so we shouldn't

233
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:50,260
matter it's true the cathedral more and
more Singh and precise that the robbery

234
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,360
and the

235
00:32:51,360 --> 00:33:02,750
sensitive come out of the fifth problem
that's our battery that means if more

236
00:33:02,750 --> 00:33:09,500
accurate pepper and you know to solve
these sensitive problem we love our

237
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:17,950
power trigger barrage and to make this
as you know they they said we should be

238
00:33:17,950 --> 00:33:26,410
like card as a credit card so we use
some of the PCB

239
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,360
our card funded M

240
00:33:34,330 --> 00:33:40,260
this is a higher frequency is uniquely
his only career under the black one is

241
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:49,990
the electron was a reader so they tried
to find her so easy

242
00:33:52,250 --> 00:34:03,779
area de antes on this weekly reader is
not but it didn't work as it sees no

243
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:08,649
vacancy yeah so I remember it is putting
its means it rocky

244
00:34:12,629 --> 00:34:23,159
so hard to find Ares you know if you
want to put it in you want it and you

245
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:31,139
don't want to get out you don't want to
every time you want to tap tap

246
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:38,970
I don't want to play it out and so what
do we want to do is just lay there is a

247
00:34:38,969 --> 00:34:48,719
bus car radar so there is some you know
some how to pronounce something that

248
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:55,779
there will be only carrier so we were
detected and the when we find out it's

249
00:34:55,780 --> 00:35:03,910
about career or so the generals will not
be walked and this product's my beast

250
00:35:03,910 --> 00:35:10,379
and by about one month's one was charged
on does so we just want to make it

251
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:17,910
longer and there is out there is in the
markets there will be some device to

252
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:23,980
detect you didn't wanna get us in South
under this level on this on this topic

253
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:33,670
these guys are all over so if you get
out of the market the device will be no

254
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:36,670
one be armed

255
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:46,710
August problem I met him before he's not
quite a barn and because you don't care

256
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:55,870
if it will be seen as a as we want my
site and you can use a large battery and

257
00:35:55,870 --> 00:36:07,710
not quite as cool as you can do and so
if you want your own so here is out of

258
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:14,610
the shower I believe the fourth quarter
will explain so we just upload all these

259
00:36:14,610 --> 00:36:22,810
three products that before we better
because our hardware to diner is married

260
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:29,900
is marrying in his home so we don't have
the old south korea scatter so we were

261
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:38,100
uploaded a one-by-one now I think the
young reader all these get have now so

262
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:48,330
you to focus on Opera class all of my
info over issues such as I mentioned I

263
00:36:48,330 --> 00:37:03,810
will combine all are so this is our way
designers and thank you very much

264
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:24,870
on what you're doing it without using
the phone how do you have to be that

265
00:37:24,870 --> 00:37:36,900
close to the contact info that one for a
tax would be effective task number it's

266
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:45,570
it's supported the e-reader under you
know it's it's quite a close ok and the

267
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,840
next one is there a way to actually
attach an antenna text if you could put

268
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,720
it in the closing an enclosure next to
adorn its like to camouflage could you

269
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:10,640
put in the extender antenna on to that
device and yes I believe it's not it's

270
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:17,779
quite a different hotel because the lake
are the reader's attention is you know

271
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:24,880
get our largest power about to attack it
don't have so much power as it did back

272
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:29,250
in the closure would be able to extend
that but I'll talk a little bit off line

273
00:38:29,250 --> 00:38:34,410
21 that also the last most important
question can I buy one now and leave

274
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:46,040
Singapore with a hacker I D Iowa now I
have interviewed international any more

275
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:46,890
questions
