1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:06,310
so my name is Ivan I talked about
Kimberly injections let me first

2
00:00:06,310 --> 00:00:11,899
introduced myself is made to either I'm
application security researcher with our

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:18,230
10 years experience and also also or
suicide request forgery by bold this is

4
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:25,410
teaching it with numbers of examples and
explodes in them of suicide forgery and

5
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:30,330
also Buck Hunter provided by different
companies and I think not so lucky but

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,230
country because I'm making a living by
running a company called will we make

7
00:00:35,230 --> 00:00:42,989
application security solution based
based on machine learning so let me

8
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:49,239
introduce here's your first with some
background of this work this work is

9
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,570
continuation of April spoke about
injections present obligatory years ago

10
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:03,559
and ensure the conclusion of this work
was it is possible to inject a bitter in

11
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:11,408
taste comments such as said get flash
hole and others in Turkey names and the

12
00:01:11,409 --> 00:01:19,270
simple exploit can looks like this and
people ought to buy red color and you

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:27,999
can see you line delimiter can inject
provide us to inject different

14
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:35,669
instructions in the fields are important
thing from previous work that it is also

15
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:41,048
possible to break state of memcached

16
00:01:41,709 --> 00:01:48,469
us there but I think in the comments
such as comment or leave a key length

17
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,969
more than 250 by its and in this case

18
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,649
memcached server will return error of
asked a very soon if forced the chance

19
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:07,630
and but still there but that's ok
between this

20
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:15,760
server and client to open and after
their client and additional bigots into

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:21,340
surrender spigots can be interpreted by
Sarah send you instructions and your

22
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:29,739
comments so and so important scenes from
previous books it's mine exploded

23
00:02:29,739 --> 00:02:38,160
facebook when a cool inject some data
into elasticsearch by different special

24
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,730
characters from Jason like braces and
chords this is three main things which

25
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:54,690
are used at my new research so and what
is key value of course very popular

26
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:02,950
killers data bases its part of no sequel
but the bases soon or so first one is

27
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:11,099
very popular and its my it was my
previous work at 22 years ago and second

28
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:23,250
is it is not so popular by and based on
the same box as a one israelis area can

29
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:33,060
coach Debbie and I will talk about what
a difference between police seek

30
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:43,440
injection fuel injection really
important different said if we talk

31
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,410
about single injection we always talk
about bucks in application cord

32
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:56,700
vulnerable vulnerability was an
application court and if we talk about

33
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:04,140
people injection we always talk about
repeating reber's its application court

34
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:09,549
records can't cut it and it is a native
court for example in the sea as well as

35
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:18,760
speech it's a really huge difference
between this two kinds of injections so

36
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:30,659
now you can use simple ways to use this
same techniques as you used to

37
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:36,080
found an exploit secure injection to
exploit kimbrell injections for us to

38
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,620
replace caught two new lines and double
dots in case of Bristol Bay if you want

39
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:46,300
to select something you'd get if you
want to insert something new said if you

40
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:49,300
want to

41
00:04:52,940 --> 00:05:05,850
both server and try to your instructions
are dead officials you can also use

42
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:14,200
three quizzes envelop keys to exceed
number should limit Rosicky lens right

43
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,659
but sometimes this limit can be huge for
example out on Gigabyte

44
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:32,340
how to fight the first one is simple
simple one bite father and the second

45
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:40,179
one is still my father to cover multi
multi byte encoding such as cynical sort

46
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:51,230
of thousands different father by limit
by my lens to 24 2010 lands right and

47
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,720
second it's double dots props like as
postural sent to to try to abuse REST

48
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,900
API filtration and Urals

49
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:11,229
acted worker images and you can download
it from did happen so I get up so first

50
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:19,500
one is ready to really propose a
database and Kimberly are ready so its

51
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,860
political reasons

52
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:26,440
new lending limit system but more
interesting we're ready

53
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:34,270
supports two different implementation of
rest in parallel first one is called

54
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:37,060
online comments

55
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:45,130
the simple syntax like cash with the
same as the same the same comments

56
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:53,900
really looks and this button it never
used any rappers and second line is more

57
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:03,650
secure and the based on the pope's
episodes of corporate rules client to

58
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:13,620
server numbers of arguments raised my
client sent to serve a number of

59
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:23,610
arguments example 3123 and before each
of part of the data before each data

60
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:31,289
from her purse strings clients should
send to server lands of this paper for

61
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:37,330
that it's really impossible to take
something even if you can inject your

62
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:47,409
lines here if your client in our cases
stripper can calculate lands clearly he

63
00:07:47,410 --> 00:08:01,270
can in this field and for several
enterprises ticket this without any

64
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:05,049
injections so also supports

65
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:17,469
scripting engine and Allscripts unboxing
but recently the sandbox past you can

66
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:22,190
use this link to look at this paper us

67
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,690
of course much now so also

68
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:36,900
comment conflict which can provide us to
write a bitter files on the system by

69
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:44,169
using conflicts can succeed the profile
name comments

70
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:59,030
it also well known fact and exploit and
get some security here so analyzed 80

71
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,100
percent and 11 fighting Robert and
several members of general motors and

72
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,640
rubbers and without any results

73
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:14,439
each of them all of them are using about
drinks with data lines before databank

74
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,830
it's it's it's really so my treatise
kill ants

75
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:29,120
doesn't work because red is a closed
circuit assembly comment

76
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:39,970
just like you can see path of Radiance
source court and function return shearer

77
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:51,790
close associate of course you can send
invalid comment by by Santana key is

78
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:57,360
land sold out on Gigabyte but after that
range closes circuit and there is no way

79
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,360
to inject thompson here

80
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:12,450
and last year organizers and each city
if this does this task and this task

81
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:19,110
consists of oil from radio to inject
into readies by finding new lines

82
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:27,520
characters data sheets so I think this
guest user Thompson self courted on a

83
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:39,790
clear sockets because general chopper
chopper can be here any anymore after it

84
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:51,640
was really angry but but after the
leakage time most search I found raped

85
00:10:51,640 --> 00:11:01,949
to exploit a disservice by thinking she
related data so when you try some

86
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:12,150
rappers such as radios ski and others by
different platforms not not only by PHP

87
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:22,180
do socialization of any data source is
this rapper serialize object to stream

88
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:29,370
and then puta string controlled storage
right because there is no way to store

89
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:39,960
something like metadata and how this
paper can understand which take her

90
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:43,500
story

91
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:56,360
the Kimberly Stewart right only by this
date for these examples of using fetal

92
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:01,930
liver functions are similar and the
taker can

93
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:08,709
send data as the streams

94
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:21,949
I can serve as a dating my best effort
and they diffuse rate in my breasts and

95
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:29,149
application stores its data streams and
then received this is true and try to

96
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:35,990
suggest that it is maybe see related
interrater socializes and it still be

97
00:12:35,990 --> 00:12:49,320
exploitable many cases so it's all about
radius second one is really have to but

98
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:54,010
of course it's REST API and pull tab US
based protocol

99
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:07,700
separate brought to you by the original
wrapper by recommender and the foot

100
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:16,070
above used by other rappers reaction
description engines search engine based

101
00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:19,070
on upper solar and also have a MapReduce

102
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:22,070
engine which can

103
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:31,560
different JavaScript code from client
but it is deprecated and also selling

104
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:41,150
insurance and it's also a fact because
one gay already exploited to bypass

105
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:53,770
restrictions because react can execute a
court only from local sales africa is a

106
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:57,180
first use JavaScript to boot

107
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:09,870
literary data into local air on file and
them as these local file by 1 comment

108
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:23,330
was really nice so about talk about
injections and fans protection at key

109
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:31,400
names and something like dots or funeral
just parts of rural will put it in a

110
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:42,150
regional you can be parts any could do
something like to you can change your

111
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:43,490
escapades

112
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:52,330
method by using simple doubled arts and
salacious and this is example example

113
00:14:52,330 --> 00:15:16,930
demonstrates one coach so he really
storage costs based on documents but in

114
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:30,029
general we can cause is it as coach also
Harris dpi and JavaScript sandbox engine

115
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:42,779
insight and also provide us function to
do so by using speech show to replicate

116
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:53,689
and when planned this method client also
sent a server IP address and Broughton

117
00:15:53,690 --> 00:16:01,850
host name server and after decades he's
put it into practice by coach baby and

118
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:06,220
then coached AP establish new connection
to this host

119
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:14,180
it's possible to do something like so
because hosting thought controlled by

120
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:18,270
her son's case for it what about
questionable

121
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:35,100
and

122
00:16:44,059 --> 00:17:07,389
but it works so you can inject worst
appear a driver so like his double dots

123
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:19,089
but you must first bite so as one
example rules to be chilled

124
00:17:21,689 --> 00:17:26,890
rubber hose GB 1st fun

125
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:34,150
safety function in her at 3:04 a.m.

126
00:17:37,059 --> 00:17:48,980
program uses safety in court in by so
well in court which each other parts but

127
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:58,630
as a function get you forget about that
all data from function arguments until

128
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:12,340
you tell us about infiltration real
estate but can check so if you like

129
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:20,909
search say before I was able to analyze
different texture of course as well as

130
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:31,059
well but before he can save their
problem because in sometimes

131
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:44,199
books are not included pie by air sea
and that is it if you can inject

132
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:52,250
different parts of Europe inject double
dots and as a function such as shut down

133
00:18:52,250 --> 00:19:01,350
for us to church to as a part of UAL and
after the European doing something like

134
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:08,678
index really turned it down so
Christopher a

135
00:19:08,679 --> 00:19:19,530
injections really need and can be easily
found by sympathizing so what

136
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:26,629
conclusions post mister peres doesn't
provide us change is sleepy method we

137
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:34,830
can change the URL Buy rating change
letters from for example to delete or

138
00:19:34,830 --> 00:19:36,649
something like that

139
00:19:36,650 --> 00:19:47,900
it's possible to change parts of HTTP
requests in especially in case it's

140
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:53,920
right i cant checked inside so strong

141
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:57,940
to do something like this yet but its
rural area

142
00:20:02,169 --> 00:20:08,929
second one is booting comments sometimes
for riders to write files and also

143
00:20:08,929 --> 00:20:14,519
provide us to service attack was
fortunate and sometimes providers to

144
00:20:14,519 --> 00:20:23,419
execute arbitrary courts boxes but not
so good sometimes and so robbers can be

145
00:20:23,419 --> 00:20:33,009
back in this area lies by themselves
it's really need think can see related

146
00:20:33,009 --> 00:20:36,080
links in a stream fields and is Sept

147
