1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:05,960
sub talking today about Laura and its
main private school or when exactly kind

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,059
of what it is

3
00:00:08,058 --> 00:00:15,629
security works and also you can actually
do to try and test so to give an

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:23,170
introduction for those of you who don't
know me some SQZ consultants and WR

5
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:28,750
security researchers well so some of the
stuff I've done in the past has several

6
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:34,030
years involved and with security if you
look up points were in a couple years

7
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:38,780
ago we had a winning entry in there it's
cool to see these core think of 2 I'm

8
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,120
actually kind of proud of such a low
skill managing to get through these days

9
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,209
I look at operational technologies so
that's looking at embedded systems I

10
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:58,800
could see and industrial control systems
are back in November last year we we've

11
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,029
started looking at a number of
industrial events and these conferences

12
00:01:06,029 --> 00:01:11,310
want security conferences they were just
places where major vendors so semen

13
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:15,950
Samsung everyone in the kind of IOT
space the ICS space could present the

14
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:19,539
latest technology and the latest
protocols are using the latest

15
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:23,149
applications services everything that
they they had to wash them we thought

16
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:26,749
this was a great opportunity to go along
and talk to them about this and also try

17
00:01:26,749 --> 00:01:29,958
and get an understanding of what kind of
new technologies are moving into this

18
00:01:29,959 --> 00:01:34,950
space so we can try and stay ahead of
the curve this particular events the

19
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:38,979
European utility week is is massive like
hundreds and hundreds of vendors every

20
00:01:38,979 --> 00:01:43,340
venue can ever named head of how to
store thousands of people are attending

21
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,999
a big event and obviously we feel like
I'm attending this we need to prepare we

22
00:01:47,999 --> 00:01:52,098
need to talk to technical staff about
the kind of protocol is a using the

23
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:57,549
country illegally using so let's let's
have a look of the kind of protocols we

24
00:01:57,549 --> 00:02:02,369
expect to see in in this kind of space
and these are our assumptions the kind

25
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,289
of things we would expect the unexpected
no secret of uses low-power radio

26
00:02:06,289 --> 00:02:09,919
protocols sort of maybe you know using
Bluetooth Low Energy

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,410
the country's you sector see in this
sort of Smart City devices in in PL

28
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,250
season and industrial systems
unfortunately when we actually arrived

29
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,400
on the first day I kind of got there so
to speak and every one of these names

30
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,920
never came up these these particles
never came up I think one or two reasons

31
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,459
eg me apart from that these rules
protocols that I've never hurdles and we

32
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:36,650
had to run back to our dreams meaning
and just study up as best we can we can

33
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:41,270
govern the next day and actually talk to
people about this there was actually

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,760
quite important reason behind why no one
is using those particular articles or at

35
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:50,030
least in this space not even those
protocols and you can kind of break it

36
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:55,660
down like this so we have no idea of a
case we want to send data over long

37
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,450
range over wireless them but I will use
cellular networks

38
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:04,920
you know we can use satellite
communication and if it's a little bit

39
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,420
shorter ok we can we can maybe up about
with little bit and then we can start

40
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:15,309
using things like wi-fi like Lucy's now
recently this basis and this is the kind

41
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,990
of low-power protocols that we saw in
the previous side the victory space the

42
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:25,500
Bluetooth Low Energy space area where
you now running things on batteries you

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,920
call really how things plugged into the
mains anymore so we have these protocols

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,160
coming I don't see doesn't cap and
that's what's now being filled so what

45
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,530
we have in this gap is well what if you
need things to run on batteries for

46
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:41,080
years but you still need to the from
them to be a transmitted over a range of

47
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:47,110
kilometres not meters so what we're
looking at is this helped me when I tell

48
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:52,810
people on low power wide area networks
number of criteria but obviously we want

49
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,320
if we're going to use these kind of
technologies yes they need to be low

50
00:03:55,320 --> 00:04:00,100
power but seriously low power we want to
plug about Trianon a little device put

51
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:03,200
it out miles away in the same newsroom
for years

52
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,170
needs to get a run for many kilometers
away as well we've got protocol that can

53
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:11,549
handle short-range ok it's gonna have a
low bit rate because you know you can't

54
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,010
have everything gonna be like power you
cannot long range we're not going to

55
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:18,349
send muscle-bound with us be pretty
narrow

56
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:22,479
become possible recently using one of
several modulations we shall go through

57
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:24,409
but also has to be cheap

58
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:27,330
you know we were going to mass produce
hundreds of these devices and they gonna

59
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,979
be sent around the gonna break and
people going to tread on them or steal

60
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:35,050
them we did it we need to build these
these physical devices so that the very

61
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:44,060
very cheap to make the kind of places
where you c L P one is a number of areas

62
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:48,420
stand out and are actively being
developed in so in infrastructure one of

63
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,960
the big areas is the utility companies
are very very interested in being able

64
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,479
to predict and detect things like a low
pressure and will supply its so if they

65
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:01,420
can not just wait for a custom of
Colonsay like you know my lungs full of

66
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:04,990
watermelon like it they can actually
detect this thing happening then be a

67
00:05:04,990 --> 00:05:11,540
response when smart cities I've talked
previously about places like Santander

68
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:17,680
which the city in Spain doing a whole
bunch of small city research and

69
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,040
actually applications and they've made
to reduce they may claim they reduce

70
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:27,180
energy usage in the city by up to 25% so
crazy actual benefits but doing things

71
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,960
such as just very simple stuff like
monitoring the amount of trust in their

72
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,310
laws trust ruskin plans and then they're
building up a que where's our garbage

73
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,210
collection trucks we're gonna go through
today because there's no point in

74
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:48,169
driving to an empty trash can so again
this is really make sense to use out

75
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:51,590
here on in that situation I finally
logistics people worried about the

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:54,530
containers bout that policy is being
shipped around but what if you could put

77
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,469
a tiny chip in it

78
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:59,650
1990 motor in real time you know exactly
where it is you know the temperature of

79
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:02,650
the refill unity you put your shipping
container

80
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:08,600
a really really attractive space is
attracting huge amount of investments at

81
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,890
the moment and as a result with any
space there's a number of competitors

82
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:18,020
that his number of ways of trying to
achieve this idea of saving power and

83
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:23,200
getting long range so that's kind of
three main competitors in terms of

84
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:28,090
modulation first one is ultra narrow
bands so this is the idea that you used

85
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:32,340
by a very narrow frequency shift keying
into a narrow band but you can get

86
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:38,229
longer range for its one area that's
come up quite a lot is fairly new think

87
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:41,000
so all time last year it really got
announced was that you could actually

88
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,210
use current cellular networks and I
should start building IOT on top of that

89
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:51,200
NBI ot or various companies have their
own name for it but you can actually

90
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,530
build IOT modulation

91
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:58,409
schools on top of cellular networks
finally you have Laura which is actually

92
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,100
very very 1933 competing ideas

93
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:06,550
companies getting involved in this that
are putting their names to each of these

94
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,770
the big ones fault not abandon these six
bucks hugely invested both in terms of

95
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:15,180
the number of investors putting money
into them and the amount of technology

96
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,970
that rolling else and DL CIT CIT
companies like whoaaa pushing NBC IOT

97
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:26,540
companies like orange pushing and BLT
Laura

98
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:32,060
there's one or two companies but Steve
the biggest by far is the law Alliance

99
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:36,810
which is pushing their protocol and talk
to as a result you can kind of imagine

100
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:40,460
we're in this kind of VHS versus based
Macs kind of stage there's a lot of

101
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:45,090
people competing for the same space old
saying that that Prince calls the best

102
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,840
the fastest cheapest whatever and as a
result there's a lot of companies kind

103
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,859
of siding with one or the other so if we
look at the semiconductor manufacturers

104
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,080
they're actually kind of taking sides on
this already a lot of like announcements

105
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:03,280
from these companies like we all
supposing this area because we think

106
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,359
it's the best Samsung Silicon Labs big
investors into the sink looks around

107
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,550
cellular NDC using cellular networks
load american companies will save

108
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:20,170
American telcos as well really investing
in that space and companies like

109
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:23,510
microchip already siding with with
Lauren or 11

110
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:30,470
telcos dimensions I think you can
imagine if you were a telco and you saw

111
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:34,370
this new whole new range approach was
coming up with doesn't use your network

112
00:08:34,370 --> 00:08:37,440
you going to kind of get a bit scared
about it or at least feel like you you

113
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,719
kind of missing a piece of the action so
a lot of the telecoms companies again

114
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:45,540
investing and siding with this kind of
technology

115
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:49,380
their idea is a consult plugging this
into their existing infrastructure and

116
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,200
also this as a service so again you see
Saudi Arabia lot of the american

117
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,260
companies will two systems as well

118
00:08:56,260 --> 00:09:01,300
lot of European telecoms companies are
actually South Korea telecom as well

119
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,959
with Laura and their various other
companies again with with six

120
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:16,700
somewhat Laura research any of the
others I think six blocks of make an

121
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:20,390
amazing piece of research and anyone can
do it I've run into a lot of people

122
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,790
saying I have to sign a NDA before I
conceive this back so that kind of

123
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,829
putting off looking as if folks because
of someone getting talk about it

124
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:32,810
the nice thing about laura is actually
open source anyone today can just go to

125
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,430
Laura's website and download it and get
the full specification the protocol

126
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:42,420
stack all the security and guidance on
how to install lebanon implements its

127
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:47,089
not just theory so your side in a moment
of a city that's already rolled out but

128
00:09:47,090 --> 00:09:52,210
there's a number of companies orange in
France for instance is is rolling out in

129
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:55,590
something like sixteen cities that
already has Laura infrastructure out

130
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:59,990
there recently they also pushed out
these kind of small lamps to their

131
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:04,520
employees that would actually become
these kind of gateways for Laura that

132
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,449
employees are expected to put in their
own homes that's ok interesting also the

133
00:10:09,450 --> 00:10:13,610
UCI's I think make this an interesting
area for research we're not talking

134
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:18,220
about small fridges hair or or bins per
se I i dont care if someone is in my

135
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,080
friends and I flush my toilet that they
are being used for things I think have a

136
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:26,790
safety and security is already being
talked about for Haiti can also make

137
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:29,819
trained level crossings with this case

138
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,560
you know we can build up already seen
one instance where some was designed a

139
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,380
burglar alarm system

140
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:40,550
and number of industrial control systems
as well so if we can look at this area

141
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:43,819
find skirts finding something that would
have genuine impact

142
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,839
was from the conference itself and on
day one I was going up to people and

143
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:56,010
saying what protocol to use and how does
a security on that the response I got no

144
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,699
see the sales staff has been told this
one line to say when people ask don't

145
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:07,560
worry you say yes 128 encryption yeah I
feel much more comfortable so I started

146
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,579
going up to me and saying look at it
from a yes once waiting Christian how to

147
00:11:10,579 --> 00:11:14,130
security work on your products and that
the stunned silence which follow because

148
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:19,130
I just use their online that's kind of
good indication to me that's worth

149
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:19,860
looking into

150
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,370
and as I said if you want to go to that
website can download suspect now to

151
00:11:24,370 --> 00:11:31,690
actually see all the security features
to my role in as a consultant as a

152
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:35,459
researcher means I'm gonna get clients
come up to me and say we were thinking

153
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:39,369
of doing this crazy idea with this thing
that no one's ever thought of before how

154
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:46,690
safe is done and it's it's been fine
that's just terrible answer so I need to

155
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:50,029
understand it well enough to to be able
to you to explain why you could do this

156
00:11:50,029 --> 00:11:55,120
but be careful and this will be the
repercussions family companies might be

157
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,279
saying well we've got these two products
both say they use Lauren laura lion

158
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,770
that switch which one should be changed
so that's gonna be due diligence and

159
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:05,770
glamorous as well need to think about

160
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,449
to the recent from November to now this
is what I V presenting the rest of this

161
00:12:10,449 --> 00:12:15,029
talk was was kind of finding the
following goals so is that even possible

162
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,480
is this whole thing holds stock of
college which is thinly veiled we're

163
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,480
just gonna fall of Albany trying to use
it or is actually very good

164
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:26,000
then to go from there and say well if
you are going to use it what do you need

165
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,270
to worry about

166
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,270
and finally if you designed something
happy test how do you know what you

167
00:12:31,270 --> 00:12:34,199
produced to secure insecure how do you
go about

168
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,460
finding vulnerabilities in this bitch

169
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:39,100
you know given that there aren't any
tools or anything else that's how to

170
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:41,900
explain how to do this

171
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:45,170
so this is the process we followed by
specification great let's have a good

172
00:12:45,170 --> 00:12:49,469
read through from a security point do
another state with Laura

173
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:52,940
independent so you know trying to do

174
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:59,570
MIG gun groups to real life style are
you using in full and in from that we

175
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,560
can put that all in into a paper and
that's what we've done

176
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,510
reduce tools weather data testing tools
so that other people can then go out and

177
00:13:07,510 --> 00:13:10,880
actually prove or disprove the
securities of these products

178
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:18,970
dive straight into security we need to
know what the hell though right is laura

179
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:22,820
lion is we know it's a low-power wide
area network but let's not even get more

180
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:25,680
details

181
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,069
Solara what I'm talking about loyalists
to file a path of Radiance modulation

182
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:32,620
Laura want news the MAC layer protocol
sat on top

183
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:39,339
the modulation itself is actually owned
by some timely patent license else

184
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:43,240
whether lenders as far as I know some
tech and the only people with the

185
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,380
official kids being through the testing
yet but I'm expecting other

186
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:52,380
manufacturers to come along soon offer
alternatives be lower away inspect is

187
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:56,670
entirely anyone can go and build a
product tomorrow using that doesn't have

188
00:13:56,670 --> 00:13:59,510
to worry about licensing success but
it's pretty attractive and that's quite

189
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:07,029
a different model to a lot of its
competitors have a look at how this

190
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:10,970
thing exists is going to somehow run
across the city is going to be one isn't

191
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:18,270
going to be secure compliance first will
you gonna have notes and grab one now

192
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:45,620
European one which is probably what is
no demos today as the ISI band is

193
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:51,529
different for each region so the
European runs on a 68 megahertz pretty

194
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:57,290
cheap and easy the idea is this is just
a translation of you plug it into some

195
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,089
kind of microcontroller other kids so
into a Raspberry Pi and soon but I'll do

196
00:15:01,089 --> 00:15:07,790
whatever you want to know he's but these
nodes are gonna be the the the the very

197
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:12,819
low power particularly 21 scattered
across the city very cheap numerous of

198
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:18,050
them and they gonna use this Laura Laura
line protocol to speak that time to

199
00:15:18,050 --> 00:15:22,329
Mexico to have a ways to this is a
gateway made by Multitech Europe them

200
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:27,170
they're actually powered you need enough
to cover the city so that the nodes can

201
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:33,250
talk back to these gateways range of
these notes talk to the gate waves is in

202
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:36,370
kilometers people have said anything
from a couple of kilometres up to about

203
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:42,720
15 kilometers depending on on buildings
and other kind of noise in the way to

204
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,890
know to be talking about two gateways
finally you'll have your very sort of

205
00:15:46,890 --> 00:15:50,360
traditional world used to it or I T
network will see some help deals with

206
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,350
this data

207
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,650
so the spec talks about having a network
server will also be some kind of one or

208
00:15:56,650 --> 00:16:01,459
more application services in the
background so network service talk to

209
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:06,890
the gateway is that will be very very
traditional normal technology so I do

210
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:10,939
something kind of network or maybe if
the gateways are spread out around the

211
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,130
city

212
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:17,500
give them some kind of 3G dongle so that
they can talk back to the network so the

213
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:23,100
gateways to the notes will be using
these these Laura broadcasts so the idea

214
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,850
is it snowed just sends out its
broadcast message and because it's in

215
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:31,150
range of a gateway that'll get picked up
it might hit two gateways but hopefully

216
00:16:31,150 --> 00:16:34,850
the network service smart enough to
actually pick up the message you know

217
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:37,850
came from a single note

218
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:41,890
notes have to be pretty low-powered
obviously that's kind of the point of

219
00:16:41,890 --> 00:16:44,750
them so they can be listening the whole
time

220
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,920
course they do that's going to take a
lot of power so the standard way for

221
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:53,790
them to work as a whole in reply kind of
way to the node will broadcast they will

222
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:57,880
pick it up through two networks and the
Note will have a number of listening

223
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,080
Windows very very short brief the
network seven knows about the networks

224
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:07,730
wants to send a reply that window so by
standard the gate of the network servers

225
00:17:07,730 --> 00:17:13,720
can talk to the notes are less than
replying to a message the gateways in

226
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:17,650
all of this as you can see completely
done devices they just proximal traffic

227
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:21,980
through that I'm positive that it look
at it to make sure its it was to them

228
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,980
another rival companies globally

229
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:29,370
now said the gateways have pretty good
range so this is just the city of months

230
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:34,699
and pretty big city and the red dots
here are the gateways so they put six

231
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:39,210
gateways that's covered most of the city
certainly the eastern side you can see

232
00:17:39,210 --> 00:17:41,330
the sort of center of the city

233
00:17:41,330 --> 00:17:47,260
and the western part of a bigger
buildings more noise lower coverage but

234
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:51,000
as soon as you get outs to sit outside
the city's only covers gets very very

235
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,990
good and eventually come into an entire
city using just six gateways you can

236
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,960
throw the whole number of nodes in now
and be comfortable the VPN to

237
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,480
communicate back to home so that's the
basics thats the only component that

238
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:10,500
really make up Laura network and that
sort of thing about attack vectors now

239
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:15,809
this this is a mass this is incredibly
complex isn't just you know I know I'ma

240
00:18:15,809 --> 00:18:19,789
little country Windows domain we've now
got most will pry school some of the

241
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:24,139
wireless we've no idea what this gateway
two networks might look like the notes

242
00:18:24,139 --> 00:18:28,610
themselves should be worried about that
and this is where the research was kind

243
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,469
of I thought the main value of it
because the specification might tell you

244
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:36,720
how it could work but how do we go about
testing this thing like the number of

245
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:41,179
attack vectors you've got here it is is
is hugely how do you paradise how do you

246
00:18:41,179 --> 00:18:47,990
actually work out what you need to test
so for security everything works on the

247
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:51,420
symmetric keys so you'll have

248
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:55,050
a network session key an application
such a case the application session key

249
00:18:55,050 --> 00:19:02,260
here is in red network session key here
is in blue now when the node wants to

250
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,010
talk it will increase its ok wants to
talk to the application server will

251
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:09,960
encrypt using application session key
and read and sign using the network

252
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:16,450
session complete so as a message goes
through the networks can check yes the

253
00:19:16,450 --> 00:19:21,600
entire package signed knows manipulated
that message and it called decrypt the

254
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,399
message which is quite nice you can have
this kind of split there may be other

255
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,720
companies are in service

256
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,440
the payload that message goes through
the application server where it's got

257
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,610
the other key so it's able to decrypt
and maybe increase replying on the same

258
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:40,340
process works there may be other
situations where the network seventies

259
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:44,669
to manage these notes exchange channel
behave in exchange the spread factor

260
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:48,830
because there's too much noise around
him and that they would use a command

261
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:53,520
message that can be another thing
injected into the packet core network

262
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:56,820
services only got one of those kids who
is now going to encrypt and signed using

263
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,820
this network session key

264
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:06,820
joining networks fairly complicated
imagine you are now a water utility you

265
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:08,049
want to roll this thing out

266
00:20:08,049 --> 00:20:12,000
you've rolled out and after six months a
couple of these things have broken how

267
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:17,270
do you put a new note into this network
so the first option pretty obvious

268
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:20,460
you've got hold of all these notes
before you ship them out but all the

269
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:25,220
keys straight on those nodes he should
be unique per node so you need to worry

270
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,309
about how exactly you gonna sort of
provision these keys and keep them safe

271
00:20:28,309 --> 00:20:32,408
but this is called activation by
personalization through the keys on the

272
00:20:32,409 --> 00:20:38,679
no voice of them out they start up they
start talking everyone's happy the other

273
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:44,490
option more complicated is over the air
activation now this point the nose

274
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,240
ascent house knowing which application
idea they are they've got a DeviceID and

275
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:57,820
they've got a temporary application she
again unique pundit so we gotta worry a

276
00:20:57,820 --> 00:21:00,520
little bit because these notes now need
to somehow get this network session

277
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:06,049
kidnap cases session key without a man
being able to detect it so his Jinan

278
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:11,010
China listen and we've gotta know
somehow needing to talk to our server so

279
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:16,600
I know firsthand join request message
request message has the unique app I D

280
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:23,389
unique device IDs so no specific I D and
annonce generated by the note not

281
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,070
encrypted

282
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:27,070
signed with an application key

283
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:35,620
so these can now use that information
generated unknowns and derive what's the

284
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:42,389
session key should be from this so
network service are you should do

285
00:21:42,390 --> 00:21:46,780
obviously as first check the best
signature is valid check the state of

286
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:50,379
that no didn't you just joined five
minutes ago has never done before should

287
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:54,230
be joining now and if it's comfortable
than it needs to go ahead and generate

288
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:59,320
recession keys the former is using so
it's going to take the application key

289
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:04,909
cuz honestly it knows it as well use the
devices nonsense sent over generators

290
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:10,030
own nonce and use this formula to
generate the two she's been used for the

291
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:17,030
rest of its time to say yes that's fine
you can join that statins all good I

292
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:21,580
generate the keys now it doesn't send
the case itself but it kanell send its

293
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,389
own months back to the note and increase
it with the application key so again

294
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:31,660
listening in the middle doesn't have
that out messages contain one on SUSE

295
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:37,470
their whole content rights the two
session keys the note can because it has

296
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:42,890
that information about a man's left
completely stuck unable to decipher

297
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:49,200
decrypt deputies do anything but the
notes most to join safely to messaging

298
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,450
itself obviously again we're worried
about this broadcast of it potentially

299
00:22:53,450 --> 00:22:57,660
sensitive information so we're going to
use these be session keys as described

300
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,940
previously to encrypt and sign the
application is both kids this command

301
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:08,260
messages which is using the network
session came ok let's let's dive into

302
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:13,080
the massive it when people say they
gonna use AES 128 encryption for these

303
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,600
messages what they actually mean is now
using encounter mode to generate a key

304
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:21,850
stream so for each message that the note
was to send its gonna use this formula

305
00:23:21,850 --> 00:23:26,810
essentially take a whole bunch of data
including important a couple of counters

306
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:32,110
basically how many messages have I sent
and encrypt that with the key in a fully

307
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:36,620
just keeps incrementing the ID value on
the end and generates a nice long key

308
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,580
stream the idea that this key stream can
be regenerated by the server

309
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,399
has all this information and should be
unique that every single message that

310
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:56,389
get sent with the payload and consent on
safely so the Mac payload there so the

311
00:23:56,390 --> 00:24:00,690
FRM payload that's what we're worried
about that Saleh applications they say

312
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:05,450
whatever it's sending me something we
want to keep safe with an excellent with

313
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:08,250
the case train put it on that payload

314
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:13,169
Taylor goes into five payload and the
mix the message until integrity message

315
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:19,120
integrity check is the signature so only
the paler gets encrypted but the whole

316
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:28,100
message gets signed so we talked about
the basics thats all there is to the

317
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:32,740
security really there's an extra option
though for what's called Class B they

318
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:36,139
come across the network's public transp
systems because it's got nothing to do

319
00:24:36,139 --> 00:24:42,789
with outside of traditional definition
of a Class B network added functionality

320
00:24:42,789 --> 00:24:47,010
once all these notes of setup you can
upgrade the whole system to a Class B

321
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:53,799
Class B helms's a couple of extra
options what if one of the nodes is

322
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:57,299
moving constantly between gateways quite
possible we can put it in a container

323
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:03,408
that could be a problem and what if the
network seventies talks the note live in

324
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:08,450
IV has to wait for a day week and month
announced in reply that might not be

325
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:12,429
effective for the solution that you're
trying to build

326
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:20,130
so once we decided everyone a class B
system to help through this there's a

327
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:24,570
couple of extra functions the gateways
previously just dumb positive thing for

328
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:29,029
now have a function they gonna stop
broadcasting this kind of information

329
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:36,890
that's going to include the gateways GPS
location and a time stamp so the note

330
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:42,649
can now look at this information and
decide our gateways to the networks are

331
00:25:42,649 --> 00:25:47,289
already using that time information say
okay that's the networks time as the

332
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:55,210
official time of this network are set
mine tunnel and onto that match then use

333
00:25:55,210 --> 00:26:00,440
that time to open these listening
windows in sort of a way that the

334
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:04,210
network service also level so now the
networks have a nice ok every minute

335
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:08,399
every hour you gonna be listening so
like Nelson the message fast it also

336
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,649
allows the ability for the networks
whereas previously you would need to

337
00:26:11,649 --> 00:26:16,299
encrypt using each node's independent
key now you can send a multicast message

338
00:26:16,299 --> 00:26:19,299
to all the notes of once useful feature

339
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:27,810
so that's why do you have this very
simple plus a system which is cool reply

340
00:26:27,810 --> 00:26:32,750
using these kids to encrypt all you can
upgrade to a class B system that's as

341
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:37,120
far as the spectral egos and saying what
sound what you should be doing what

342
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:42,219
there is so this kind of weather
research stuffs wall how secure is this

343
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,720
one attacks could be actually be trying
against these systems how do we tested

344
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:50,610
it secure those lovely simple diagrams
are wonderful three components they will

345
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:53,030
talk to each other that's nice that safe

346
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:58,780
chances are this is gonna be a mess you
know that network service gonna be on a

347
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:03,310
flat network talking to $1,000 systems
and databases off somewhere else and

348
00:27:03,310 --> 00:27:07,490
it's going to be pretty complicated so
let's have a look at you trying to test

349
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:13,410
these systems festival messaging know
what you have to remember is even a

350
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:17,780
specification says this is how things
work well they actually mean is this is

351
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:22,270
how you should implement your system
that was developed this is entirely up

352
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:26,639
to you most of these security features
or implied that you should be doing them

353
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:32,690
imagine the description is performed
before the mix checked what would happen

354
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:38,250
simply let's say for some reason the
counters on incremented all the counters

355
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:44,640
are somehow reset or let's say for some
reason you decide that generating unique

356
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:48,280
session closes too difficult less space
just based on the MAC address or

357
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,480
whatever the criminalist

358
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:55,940
so if the form for the Meccans checks
well actually opens up a couple of

359
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:58,010
attacks to us

360
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:02,060
the fact that the key stream is being
generated and UX or it with plain text

361
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:04,620
means we know exactly which bites

362
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,540
corresponds who which parts of the
message so if we know from our own

363
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,680
investigations that maybe it's using
some kind of format like this we're

364
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,110
sending the temperature in the ideal we
don't know the key but we know which

365
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,280
bites of the ciphertext respect
correspond so if we were to swap outs in

366
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:25,610
this case of 5 feet 15 a change in
temperature without knowing the ok the

367
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:29,290
mix it obviously cats that because now
Ive corrupt in the signatures won't

368
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:33,020
match but if you doing just checking the
roadway rounds then that's gonna cause a

369
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:35,480
problem

370
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:40,070
manipulation is an interesting one that
should be handled by the transceiver

371
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:45,679
when completed this just separate them
worry about it according to the

372
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:50,310
specification they should always
increment and Ashley no way of resetting

373
00:28:50,310 --> 00:28:54,610
a no so if for some reason I am able to
send a message with a maximum value of

374
00:28:54,610 --> 00:28:58,439
an effort counts for now just breaks the
node is no way you can send a text

375
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:01,990
message because you have kalbi lower so
it was just ignore the message

376
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:16,820
issue is the county's being incremented
then that's one of the factors it's

377
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:20,770
making sure the key stream is unique for
every single message for each node if we

378
00:29:20,770 --> 00:29:25,340
end up in a situation where we can maybe
reset the note to the CAF count drops

379
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:29,120
back to zero but it keeps using the same
case then it means we're gonna start

380
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:34,689
duplicating out key stream and gives us
a chance to actually try and work out

381
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,170
what the pilots are because having
excellent so if you know the plaintext

382
00:29:39,170 --> 00:29:42,900
of one it's being X over the key stream
you know she's the same key stream twice

383
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:47,270
before you can exit route to work out
what the plain text of the other message

384
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:50,270
must have been

385
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:03,650
the floor in using symmetric keys that
you have to worry about what would

386
00:30:03,650 --> 00:30:05,730
happen if one of these keys was to be
compromised

387
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,429
going to number ways we can get the keys
out but essentially huge implications as

388
00:30:10,429 --> 00:30:16,580
kids everywhere you're raising the
fallout of of of cleaving compromised so

389
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:20,570
compromised monkey when everything's
working correctly then you gonna stop

390
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:24,379
being able to both encrypt and decrypt
traffic from both sides exasperation

391
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:29,590
messages messages if people are staring
he's been obviously expands to the whole

392
00:30:29,590 --> 00:30:39,379
network problem for network session keys
because this clash is not sending

393
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:42,250
command messages on that point you only
need one of the keys to start sending

394
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,250
that cause it's using it for both
encryption and signing

395
00:30:46,670 --> 00:30:53,960
messages of the network server is
sending to keep the the nodes using

396
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:57,970
great how's everything could include
things like your status but I can do

397
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:02,120
more sense to things like okay let's
change the channel change frequency of

398
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:06,600
sleep in a tacit consent that the notes
to a wrong channel suddenly nothing can

399
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,219
talk to each other anymore and if that's
a railway crossing system then thats

400
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:17,850
massive issue the bottom spec also
allows proprietary messages so again

401
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:20,159
entirely up to the vendor what they're
doing

402
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:23,660
began his case to be compromised then
you can start sending private messages

403
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:29,050
so is a big issue because you know we
need to steal the keys somehow well it

404
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:33,360
depends what network you looking at
because I think a lot of vendors don't

405
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,030
realize the value of that network key
they seem you need by welcoming message

406
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:44,840
is no you don't you just need the one so
the things network is a sort of an IOT

407
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:49,050
developer hub site probably hoping no
one's doing anything security relevant

408
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:52,809
on it because the website gives you the
network session key so that you can join

409
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:53,660
the network

410
00:31:53,660 --> 00:31:58,870
you did with the iraqi but nothing
stopping you more driving under 15

411
00:31:58,870 --> 00:32:02,540
kilometer range knocking over every node
the wrong channel also impropriety

412
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:07,879
choose whatever they might be so in that
case the attacker could do all of these

413
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:11,230
things

414
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:15,570
activation number of other things means
he look out obviously the key should not

415
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,460
be possible suspect is very very clear
on please don't use gas double the same

416
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,390
values but entirely up to the developers
and we've seen in the past they don't

417
00:32:25,390 --> 00:32:27,370
always follow those rules

418
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:33,139
able as well that you know we're in the
specter that say you should be

419
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:37,059
monitoring the state of that note so if
you suddenly get another join requests

420
00:32:37,059 --> 00:32:40,860
are you checking for that or what would
you do to generate another key override

421
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:44,010
the keys of that note again

422
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:49,240
problems key management ok pretty
obvious but I think people get

423
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,529
overlooked by several very worried about
100 very worried about the radio

424
00:32:52,529 --> 00:32:56,190
protocol but we haven't noticed as an
hour service at another company that if

425
00:32:56,190 --> 00:33:00,960
someone was to crypto locker we are
seriously in trouble because that server

426
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:05,409
and database contains all the keys that
we need to be able to communicate to

427
00:33:05,409 --> 00:33:11,750
these notes with a single point of
failure potentially some pretty basic

428
00:33:11,750 --> 00:33:16,899
stuff I think we're all comfortable here
who's got access to that server just

429
00:33:16,899 --> 00:33:22,149
against the roof at least privileges and
just even more stuff like basic things

430
00:33:22,149 --> 00:33:26,239
like if anyone's ever started their own
DHCP server on how corporate network

431
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,860
never do that doesn't make people happy
to just randomly get knocked over or

432
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:38,080
changes IP address the agency for
everyone he is going to be in two places

433
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,370
means they're going to be in the notes
saying we need to have a look at this is

434
00:33:43,370 --> 00:33:49,268
sparta know it might look like so this
is so everything sights on that half but

435
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,559
we probably could have you all
connection back to a microcontroller all

436
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:57,620
microprocessor gonna be doing a little
study what are the keys themselves are

437
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,379
going to be stored in the Laurel and
transceiver and the microcontroller can

438
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,309
say actually please use this case
shouldn't get to do is please give me

439
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:13,520
so they are unique how secure are these
actual transceivers at the moment well

440
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:19,710
this is one got here using and the
microchip strands even though we know

441
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:27,399
how you can actually still these nights
and let's face it gonna be around the

442
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:32,759
city so yes yes we could we still the
keys out of a note to restore the

443
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:37,500
firmware out alone at sea trying to
attack the ability I may be opposing

444
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,500
buggin that valuable

445
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:48,270
access communist grab onto one of the
demons faces well let's let's strip the

446
00:34:48,270 --> 00:34:53,369
sealed off and have a look underneath
the pic picture that underneath 1800

447
00:34:53,369 --> 00:34:57,900
laugh pretty good and HCC online for
stealing interfaces horrible horrible

448
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:02,840
pens I would recommend trying so long
that we did manage to respond all

449
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:07,210
afternoon children onto it only to find
that the debug pains raptly exported on

450
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:11,850
a massive debug interface and we can
just plug picked picked up three runs

451
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:16,868
and just not clearing and so we were
having a look at the flax to see using

452
00:35:16,869 --> 00:35:22,300
the the programmer environment that's
available for free on a pretty good job

453
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:29,590
it's it's thinks that all the protection
blocks to to write only read out

454
00:35:29,590 --> 00:35:36,430
interestingly page reads are allowed and
you can rights so very interesting

455
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:40,609
feature research for anyone who fancies
it I reckon it's possible she writes so

456
00:35:40,609 --> 00:35:45,090
one of those code blocks and then use
page reads to read out the rest so if

457
00:35:45,090 --> 00:35:47,600
you write to two different colored
blocks and your code starts executing

458
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:54,589
you should be added another one side
channel for most people it looks at how

459
00:35:54,590 --> 00:36:00,900
analysis BPA is nothing in the picture
to say that it has a secure encryption

460
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,000
area

461
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:07,760
could be using a library that's designed
to protect against side channel analysis

462
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:15,040
but that's again an honorary she look at
Costco complicated escape or something

463
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,420
far more simple the microcontroller can
send data

464
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,400
Laura lanterns even an increase for us
let's just replace them under control at

465
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,490
this point we're now just proximal they
too through his being encrypted and

466
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:27,330
signed for us

467
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,790
ugly pretty easy so now we can just stop
trying to send data straight through to

468
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,830
applications and who knows maybe
cross-site scripting SQL injection

469
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:43,110
causing bugs everything else certainly
that things like our billing we can

470
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:46,580
start definitely saying I have no idea
is dead no power this month don't worry

471
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:51,710
about it so we need to worry about the
attack has physical access these devices

472
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:55,710
and that means that likely they can
recover the keys if they were really

473
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:59,530
that interested also send a to throw
some can't really trust the data

474
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:06,380
interface components a pretty obvious if
you gotta networks and some gateways

475
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,260
more likely it's going to look something
like that

476
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:14,140
you be using 3G dongles plugged into the
gateways and some internet facing web

477
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:19,240
service networks have a sunny that's how
a number of components to it that gives

478
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,450
us complete access the website and every
nefarious personnel on the internet as

479
00:37:23,450 --> 00:37:23,750
well

480
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:29,040
install sending messages to it so we'll
write about us and that's again just

481
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,600
knock over a network server and the
latter point no more communication

482
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:42,060
forcing to a high degree of the signing
itself is 4 bytes so you really did want

483
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,799
to try and just brute force probably
possible ok let's say two billion

484
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:51,870
messages will have to send it to likely
look upon the correct make for a message

485
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:57,440
but not looking out for hours local time
to the correct my permission to it is

486
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:03,020
just using APN which is actually set up
to use a possible also you can witness

487
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:07,560
by NZ to at least keep that went a
little bit bay or at least maybe any

488
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,640
admin services you can almost reach you
don't goals and in VPN across as well so

489
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:18,440
that way hopefully oh and don't VPN into
the whole network please you know VPN so

490
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:23,380
that you can see the website where he's
with cosby is very good really

491
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:29,260
interesting because at this point we
actually lose encryption so we're

492
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:32,390
worried about a couple of points to
close the network's first of all this

493
00:38:32,390 --> 00:38:36,020
multicast means everyone must use the
same key data received his multicast

494
00:38:36,020 --> 00:38:40,250
messages we just lost quite important
security feature secondly really

495
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,570
important those gateway deacons things
the GPS and time

496
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:46,570
everything's every line on on encrypted
assigned

497
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:52,990
the specifications says that first of
all those multicast messages you're on

498
00:38:52,990 --> 00:38:53,839
your own

499
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,860
how you gonna set them up and use them
that's entirely up to you to figure out

500
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:02,650
how to do that safely second maybe we
don't even trust them thanks and Mac

501
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:07,730
moms across multicast messages please
because they're not as secure so

502
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:10,730
basically cost be careful

503
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:18,710
now has a real impact not just attacking
your home media attacking everyone on

504
00:39:18,710 --> 00:39:23,140
that network's the only way I can
imagine doing that is somehow you're

505
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:26,620
going to keep switching teams so you're
using your private messaging and then

506
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:30,580
your listing for multicast you send the
most costly across which point the

507
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:37,000
microcontroller is now storing and
saving five keys so yeah be careful

508
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:45,030
festival in fact gateway has 3G dongle
or some kind of way of connecting back

509
00:39:45,030 --> 00:39:50,580
to that networks to get privileged
access it out there in city and it's now

510
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:56,700
broadcasting its own GPS coordinates
signing a pretty good win for the sake

511
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:04,540
of going to war driving policy one in
the world can also send network specific

512
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,900
broadcasts so again entirely up to the
developer if you want to add some new

513
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:13,670
features on to that but be aware neither
encrypted not signed and finally there

514
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:17,490
is a known to use these for timing and
it wasn't saying respect that that's

515
00:40:17,490 --> 00:40:21,540
what you should do but looking on the
forums that is what developers are doing

516
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:25,210
the setting the system time of all those
nodes to be whatever is broadcast from

517
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:29,040
the gateway or more specifically
whatever they perceive as being

518
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,670
broadcast from the Gateway Solo possible
interesting attacks from that

519
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:42,150
quite a lot of my summer after reading
through all of this is perfectly

520
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:49,080
possible to build a secure Laura system
it's not as the salesmen are saying it's

521
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:53,440
not guaranteed because you're using
Laura therefore secure quite the

522
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,040
opposite

523
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,610
you need to know exactly what your tax
threats and I see what you can do to

524
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:05,850
protect against it that was 45 minutes
piece which is obviously a complete

525
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,580
blitz reason we've done all of us into a
white paper think we're launching it

526
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:14,700
tomorrow but it'd be free download from
our website so that'll be something that

527
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,210
goes through all of this informal
detailed walkthrough the outs with Hawks

528
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:25,390
the fences and test cases did mention
there was a tool for my programming so

529
00:41:25,390 --> 00:41:30,520
bad i think im W I would ever let me put
this on their site it's it's using

530
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:37,440
Python wineries said objects SQL JSON
from web front and it works I wouldn't

531
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,460
recommend posting it online but he's got
to the point now and once a copy of it

532
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:47,090
you can have it but I went to publishing
it just yet but it lets you do it uses a

533
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:50,540
Laura gateway is this

534
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:54,500
by these these are basically lawlessness
as gateways have to my definition

535
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:59,600
sniffle traffic so I have used one set
up so just record all the traffic then

536
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:03,509
stored in an SQLite database and then
you can actually see these messages and

537
00:42:03,510 --> 00:42:07,860
these are lower pockets taking on one
thing gives you everything that you can

538
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:12,090
read that isn't encrypted so I KML know
which channels broadcasting on it which

539
00:42:12,090 --> 00:42:19,610
network its relating to the notes I D
then lets you actually try two keys so

540
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,740
if you do know the network session key
you can just type in the obsession ki

541
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,740
Radha and in this case to case manage to
to decrypt it for us

542
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:38,520
guess there's any questions for the
blocks lifeless when they creep messages

543
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:45,759
using any signatures which surface so
when they create these messages are you

544
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,670
sure that they using AES encryption and
you said you can fight those you know to

545
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:56,350
take a block and then just replace it
with Nextel you just like they're not

546
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:02,299
using any signatures for that they are
using signatures they are so then used a

547
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:07,590
network to do an assh back when you
signed the whole thing but again it's up

548
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:12,960
to the developer to actually check those
and check before you start decrypting

549
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,110
them thanks
