1
00:00:00,329 --> 00:00:03,689
so I want to talk about their as well I
am an and

2
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:07,490
my name in the beginning I work at the
mother is such a person

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:11,440
and they want to talk about how to a

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,650
use the part where protections and
against itself

5
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,710
to help analyzed so

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,430
an email in someone so and then in the
five-day

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,609
problem and we propose a solution

8
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:30,920
one of them and which is a thinker

9
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,010
really is a compliment when we try to

10
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,540
and I some on identified by them this is
pretty

11
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:44,060
every startup and know when to enter but
they would probably will not there find

12
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:45,090
the exit the

13
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:48,250
real easy through it easy to get lost
from there

14
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,810
and be shoot that try to define their
problem

15
00:00:51,810 --> 00:00:55,750
and concentrate so to it that from this
maze

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,250
we have a some money and some picnics

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,710
is there is there might be another
gonzalez's and basically its execution

18
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:04,440
of the call

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,760
and for a while it is accusing you can

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,640
zone with their another is it in and the
specific one

21
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,320
a.m. another one is a static analysis

22
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:19,570
and basically we're looking at the cold
there without the execution in just a

23
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,870
few examples for example I double

24
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:25,130
and mmm am so

25
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:29,090
which is the base the technique from
zone this is a

26
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:35,300
depends on the problems I to sell and

27
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,960
and eventually be cool in a lil those
that both of us both

28
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,070
thus picnics to solve several problems

29
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:45,600
so we have and service engineering
binary

30
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,330
an avid in start and to do anything and
that by itself it today could be really

31
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:53,420
in a very difficult in above this

32
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,900
and I'm mahler an author both 10

33
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:01,360
at different things to a maker as such
is life for a min

34
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,880
really hard and im You Can Dance

35
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,019
a heart strings because things this is a
one other

36
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:12,490
race 2 understand what is going on and
the converse skate their various

37
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:15,810
API calls im anders als and

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,650
is open during runtime began Creek boat
they're Beckett

39
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:20,190
in

40
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:25,490
in him at their best so

41
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:28,490
and what we have here a Vera said

42
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:32,050
where is that tools and techniques to to
make us this offer

43
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:35,410
air for example a if Loki

44
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:40,360
in this binary which is as tipped off
and office kitchen and decryption

45
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,790
a Henry in June try to understand from
staying said it wanted to

46
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,910
what is going on inside a Republican
ASCE for example spicing each other

47
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:53,550
not budging and all all models to today
do it

48
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,160
a vacancy several area and the poor
communication they be nice but then I

49
00:02:58,160 --> 00:02:58,950
don't stick your

50
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,610
really understood and can understand
what is going on an insight

51
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,690
and yes if you look at the API

52
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,450
into the guys a overseas some way

53
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:14,140
really and down my imports you don't and
really can do

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,350
anything a serious this so

55
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:20,450
probably if someone is trying to hide
from months

56
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:24,880
and so forth an awful

57
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:29,150
during my water a in Inc up and down
several offers

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:33,250
its several techniques and air sometimes

59
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,739
and when they do when they do

60
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:40,080
sting of this cation as a cause that the
doc was guessing

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,560
that and look something like this: this
one which is

62
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,600
really is it could be really hot too air

63
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:49,739
reverse engineer and the name

64
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:53,500
the you don't hear it need to do it then

65
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:58,630
in some cases for example this function
was discovered during a thumb my

66
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,650
dynamic analysis a and Richmond I

67
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,959
at which when show a hip with

68
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,550
exactly that you can see that the
resting spot up and a

69
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:13,660
and after the use the delete the
dividend the free then remembering

70
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:17,870
and in addition to a static analysis
over

71
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,140
able to see is that the this function is
called several hundred times

72
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,110
and so hey I can

73
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:30,880
obviously can use the time to an office
in January but they don't really want

74
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,360
and other thing is a bit out the station

75
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,039
a all a pic also incorporated in this
such a logic

76
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:43,330
and so in general you have where summers
over

77
00:04:43,330 --> 00:04:46,960
somehow this is a a solution for a or an
APR

78
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,960
I'll

79
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:00,070
Paul home

80
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,120
this whole

81
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,520
with a gun he ok up with get the PI was
says the same population

82
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,060
and to the guys there early and is open
like them

83
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,890
and so how can we continue without
knowing any strings and the back also

84
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,320
for example stock eclipse we can
obviously is a decision at all but the

85
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,480
sometimes can be our and the not
necessary what we can do

86
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,870
began and in general make the the

87
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,820
mahler to do it for ourselves air

88
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:35,600
and has a thing for user to help us then

89
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,740
the mall but no poop to help us we can
you this appear Malaysian

90
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:45,410
and mmm a richer which have been in
general is a recipe to implement it in

91
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,280
this offering this some basic

92
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,280
memory and I don't I yeah I for my
research are you there by him

93
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,410
a which is then developed with the corps
de beers rather not be so workin im

94
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,640
and its Olivia and everything is
implementing pure Python

95
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:08,350
because although also call where for
example the

96
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,650
to in implement XR an

97
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:14,900
this is a record that was the used

98
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,770
Andrew simple an what made him on his

99
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:23,460
able to do for you is the get to control
oftentimes the curing process

100
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:27,380
kanin basically in in

101
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:31,530
look at registers second name on it
every system call

102
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:35,570
it whatever you want you are the most of
you and what they did they

103
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:41,350
a fuse thereby am with I don't pay and
the follow the basic K

104
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:44,530
the basic the rules is gone

105
00:06:44,530 --> 00:06:47,740
actually the identify the court to
emulate a

106
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,310
you can have been in that defies the II
offer the function or their

107
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,460
conjunct and and and if I over there

108
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:57,520
a pack of inside because you don't want
to execute the

109
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,500
Iowa score and there's this is their
search results for example

110
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:06,150
if you look at the PI's we have fairness
following logic

111
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:10,290
a airfare extra all that nice it is over
the same way

112
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:14,530
you have somewhere but the fine hush
money on which is the calculated from my

113
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:17,560
a pedestrian air before their
competition

114
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,570
and on every execution and

115
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:23,580
it modern political played the house
from

116
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,890
also important input that the expert at
the Iran's

117
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:30,460
and the one as much as is the ones that
there should be a call

118
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:34,200
im so it identifies according to be a

119
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:37,630
we'll no be going to emulate the is this

120
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:40,810
in this the all encapsulation is the
culprit hush

121
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:43,950
this is a a function that is in two
seasons

122
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:47,410
himmmm of

123
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:50,980
that input here is saying in general I
going names

124
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,280
and of the demolition will get is there

125
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:58,130
and hush money so and what do his thing
here is a function

126
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:01,800
was there I value and from the left is
there

127
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,150
unknown functions so a if you a

128
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,520
if executed an

129
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,520
so if you execute there's a call to
elicit the following

130
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,360
so happy I

131
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,640
unknown function with the house by
Louisville and no way to understand what

132
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,610
is there going on

133
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:28,010
after a running the script will this
city

134
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,340
and was interesting functions popped up
to you

135
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,650
and the York and continue research
without the

136
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:37,720
and any any problem
