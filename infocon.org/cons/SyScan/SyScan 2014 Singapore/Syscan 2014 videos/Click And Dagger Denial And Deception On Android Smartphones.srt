1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:03,150
my talk is going to be around a I

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:08,270
an Android distribution and a tool I've
developed to defeat a friend text

3
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,040
analysis

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,680
and seizure of Android devices as well
as make it

5
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:17,330
a more useful for operational security
purposes so

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:21,160
in theory this is how the talks going to
go um

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,300
there's going to be a very very short
OPSEC refresher course

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,519
are so people can see why I have done
the things that I've done

9
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:31,609
other than being crazy I

10
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:34,809
I will go over wife phones suck because

11
00:00:34,809 --> 00:00:38,879
they suck arm there's quite a lot to get
to their

12
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,930
then I will go over the threat model
that I was using while I

13
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,370
develop the phone now while like
basically it's very important to

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,510
understand what's

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:51,719
the phone is supposed to defeat
otherwise you might use

16
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:55,879
in the wrong way there's a variety of
solutions

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,690
but I will look at pretty much all of
them suffer in some way shape or form

18
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,439
and even though it says conclusion there
actually is one

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:08,210
but they're is a demo arm

20
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,479
this is my about me slide I like

21
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,950
long walks on the beach hacking things
and clandestine cellular networks

22
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,439
such as spy rings espionage terrorists
and criminal organizations

23
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,399
guess who doesn't right um

24
00:01:25,399 --> 00:01:29,030
okay so operational security

25
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,219
the short version everyone ready shut
the fuck up

26
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:39,009
any questions

27
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,640
now um

28
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:47,390
so here's a another good one which is

29
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:50,939
if you want to lose fight talk about it
first historically

30
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,340
operational security stuff used to be
referred to as denial and deception

31
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:59,969
these days concert something up on
archaic term but I still like

32
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:03,140
D&D um it

33
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:07,259
covers a lot of what you need to be
doing if you are for example not the

34
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,149
government HD

35
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:10,690
government agencies have a lot more
resources and want nothing to worry

36
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:11,190
about

37
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:16,170
as individuals or small groups primarily
you need to work

38
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:20,019
on the Nile just making sure no one
knows what you doing

39
00:02:20,019 --> 00:02:23,060
so the point of

40
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,430
a denial operation or all following now
based OPSEC

41
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:30,610
is to limit the amount of what's called

42
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,690
essential elements our friend the
information re: EF I

43
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:38,700
these are things that are critical to
operation

44
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,700
to prevent these peace information from
becoming available

45
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:45,659
to your adversary um usually after the
operations

46
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:49,430
over they cease to be important and then
they can come out again

47
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,610
arm obviously that depends a lot on what
you doing

48
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:57,080
but generally speaking if you don't talk
about it if fairly well-off

49
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,870
um deception is more complicated

50
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,030
the idea is that you are providing false
information to the

51
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:09,569
adversary generally speaking with a
deception operation

52
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:13,099
I the best way to approach it is to

53
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:16,480
allow the adversary to discover the
information

54
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,459
in their normal course of events so
while they're doing the regular stuff

55
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,560
they wore uncover the false information
that will allow them to piece together

56
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,319
the picture on their own

57
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:29,730
and they will have a much stronger
belief in it and a few

58
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,209
handed to them directly on a platter I
had a few handed to them they get

59
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,680
suspicious but if they discover

60
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,689
they're more likely to believe um

61
00:03:37,689 --> 00:03:43,610
yeah let them figure it out for
themselves more importantly during

62
00:03:43,610 --> 00:03:44,489
operation

63
00:03:44,489 --> 00:03:47,510
there are the 3 C's cover

64
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:52,030
concealment and compartmentation so get
you with cover is

65
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,489
it provides a plausible reason for some
action to be taken place

66
00:03:56,489 --> 00:04:00,900
others to kind of important ones the
first as cover for action

67
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,610
so that is a a reason why you are doing
something and the other one

68
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:07,629
is cover for status which is a reason
why you are

69
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:12,360
in a particular location or while you're
able to do something in particular

70
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:16,770
arm these are not very important phones
but remember that

71
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:20,220
cover tends to be very very important
that last people to

72
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,650
build a narrative that explains why
something is going on

73
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:28,440
and if the mental now took that they
construct matches what they're expecting

74
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:32,250
I'm what actually find then they will
tend to overlook it

75
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:37,110
arm concealment is fairly
straightforward just wanna hide things

76
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:40,420
I make it hard for people to find

77
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:45,080
and compartmentation is so that when all
fucked up

78
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,210
at least it's not a complete catastrophe
so the point of compartmentation

79
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:53,680
is that you limit the scope of anyone
failure

80
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:58,210
to a small subsets of data or
information operations

81
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:01,670
so that in theory I even if it is

82
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,830
compromised it is not a complete and
total failure

83
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:09,920
and practice compartmentation tends to
be quite difficult to work with

84
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,300
and people are lazy arm

85
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:17,660
which brings us to the next thing is
compartmentation cannot be complete

86
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:22,120
otherwise nothing would ever work so you
end up with the fact that people must

87
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,250
communicate

88
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:26,580
when people communicates they tend to
make mistakes

89
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:32,830
when they make mistakes the NSA is there

90
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,520
so I let's get rid of Art's phone sock

91
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,990
I unfortunately they're obviously not a
lot of alternatives

92
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:44,170
but the important thing to remember is
that a mobile phone

93
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:49,320
and operational security really do not
go together well

94
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,490
are Alan dole's pointed this out in

95
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,590
up fifties with the points that

96
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:59,400
arm the greatest material casts the
profession

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,160
that being spying despite all its
advantages

98
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,490
is undoubtedly the telephone

99
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,500
I and this was him hating on the fact
that there are people with phones in the

100
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,940
house

101
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:15,920
I imagine how pissed off it be to find
out that everyone's carrying phone

102
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:19,190
actually with them

103
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:23,360
the main problem with mobile phones

104
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,970
is that there's absolutely no way being
anonymous

105
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,310
right the best you can possibly hoped
for is

106
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:33,420
a pseudonym at: and the reason for that

107
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:37,010
here's they are tracking devices

108
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,160
that is fundamentally what they do they
have

109
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:43,430
a smart card that is tight specifically
to

110
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:47,870
one identity they arm

111
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:50,940
like when they make phone calls they
give up

112
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:54,310
all of your location information when
you move around

113
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:58,330
speak about all of your location
information arm

114
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:02,760
basically everyone that has a smartphone
can be tracked by the telcos

115
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:06,240
everyone that can be checked by the
telcos can be checked by the government

116
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:09,360
everyone I can be checked by the
government can be tracked by 5i scores

117
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:11,780
five eyes hacks all the telcos

118
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:15,280
so I mobile phones basically mean that

119
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,570
everyone knows where you are where
everyone being your adversary

120
00:07:19,570 --> 00:07:22,580
arm there's a lot of problems with no
balls

121
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:26,050
ins I'm going to just basically going to

122
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:29,740
all the things that can be used to
identify

123
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,700
immobile so you have a specific location

124
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,860
I so it from a bar gets turned on in
your home or at your work

125
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:42,780
it's immediately tie to the subset of
people that have access to that location

126
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,470
there's Mobility patents so from a ball
goes from

127
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:50,620
your home over your commuter routes to
your work

128
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:54,530
that uniquely identifies that phone as
being yours

129
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,760
because no one else is going to take
that route

130
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,180
basically you only need for arm tower

131
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:04,790
locations to identify

132
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,900
ninety percent of people uniquely based
only on

133
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:13,770
home commuter route and work I

134
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,500
I mirroring is what happens when I'm you
have

135
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,540
more than one telephone turned on at the
same time

136
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:24,790
and they travel together they will have
the same ability patton

137
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,640
so if you have a phone that you use
regularly

138
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,450
and it has now been identified as yours
and then you have your second cheap

139
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:38,430
burner phone or your anonymous phone and
you carry both of them together

140
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:41,800
they will get paired together because
mirroring

141
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:45,030
so you will have burned the anonymity

142
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:49,210
of that second device I this also allows

143
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:52,750
are building up social crops by having

144
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:57,120
arm if there's a large number of people
that come together with their mobile

145
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,560
phones and then travel in the car
somewhere

146
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:03,350
and then step the same location and then
spit up you can assume that that group

147
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,000
of people

148
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,180
has gotten together gone somewhere for a
drink

149
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:10,910
and then left they are social group
there tie together

150
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:14,170
that happens repeatedly even if they
never called each other

151
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,240
or the use other means I've I connect
with each other

152
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,880
you can start carrying them together and
creating social networks from that

153
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:25,390
so mirroring is very bad

154
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:28,870
you have to be very careful about having
devices turned on same time

155
00:09:28,870 --> 00:09:34,380
the same place up particularly for
traveling

156
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:37,820
so that's this location the next part is
the network

157
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:41,100
networks can completely screw you so

158
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:45,110
the numbers that you dial the people
that call you

159
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:49,800
and the calling patterns that you have
to all uniquely identify you

160
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,870
so even if you swap out your phone but
none of your mates to

161
00:09:53,870 --> 00:09:57,260
you will still be uniquely identified
because you're the only person that has

162
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,570
that said of people that from them

163
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:02,630
get phone calls from them and do it in

164
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:06,470
a particular pattern so you might call
your friend all the time but your mother

165
00:10:06,470 --> 00:10:08,060
only occasionally

166
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:11,960
arm that would be something that
uniquely identifies you

167
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,240
so calling patterns will actually make
it very very obvious who you are

168
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,790
then there's the actual physical
identifiers on the phone which is the

169
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:26,530
I me which is the I unique serial number
of the mobile device

170
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:29,910
and the EMC which is the unique serial
number of

171
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:34,410
the a SIM card its usually a combination
of

172
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:38,620
arm your are you home country

173
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:43,310
I a taco network and your phone number
in some way plus some other

174
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,610
identifying information so MC is very
bad

175
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:49,950
its basically links SIM card directly to

176
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:54,710
a database in a telco I'm Yours very
back if they get paired together

177
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:58,780
swapping out SIM cards doesn't actually
help you because they can

178
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:02,000
a game matched us together so physically

179
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,600
device is a very easy to identified

180
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,000
and when you're speaking to someone game
you can be identified

181
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,120
I if you use names or locations that can
be picked up because it's all in plain

182
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:14,640
text

183
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,040
and not scripted others boys
fingerprinting

184
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:22,530
so are they can actually just match on
the fingerprint of your voice how

185
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,560
how it has a unique pattern and keywords

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,600
so if they're just looking for specific
keywords that you end up saying

187
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:34,250
you can also get mats on that so content
completely fucked

188
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:40,580
and this is with a dumbphone smartphones
on the other hand our way he works

189
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:45,040
I spot smartphones have at network
analytics

190
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:49,700
they've got GPS devices they've got all
these ap stats scraping upload

191
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:53,980
your entire mobile phone contents
they've got mothership pings where they

192
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,020
will periodically just paying back home
to announce that they're still alive

193
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:01,850
I if you're using an Android phone all
have unique android:id

194
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:06,560
they have a mac Address but they will
have an IP address

195
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,050
they will have a list all of the wifi
beacons that they've ever seen know that

196
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:11,400
they've associated with

197
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,360
or that are around them they've got
cameras they've got microphones

198
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,779
and they've got sensors that allow them
to do gait analysis

199
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:22,350
um basically smartphones are the devil

200
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:28,029
I'm that they are absolutely terrible if
you're trying to be anonymous

201
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:32,360
sort that out of the way what I was
concerned about when I was trying to

202
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,610
make a safe one

203
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:37,990
was a specific threat model my specific
that model

204
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:41,440
was local security force

205
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,900
I local security forces tend not to have
the same sources

206
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,010
as a national security force

207
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:51,370
um in particular they do not have
nation-state actor

208
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:55,400
level resources behind so while they
might be able to see the contents of

209
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,510
your phone

210
00:12:56,510 --> 00:13:00,730
they will not necessarily be able to
query globally all of the

211
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:04,870
telco data I they might not be able to
talk to

212
00:13:04,870 --> 00:13:08,170
telco and gets completes information

213
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:13,779
about that arm this was specifically
because I was asked to do

214
00:13:13,779 --> 00:13:17,290
%uh this project for Al Jazeera and

215
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:21,860
they have had problems with putting
reporters in Syria

216
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,100
and that's where you get to do what like
gentleman like this

217
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,029
so um one of the issues that they had

218
00:13:29,029 --> 00:13:34,400
was that's their reporters got arrested
by militiamen who had searched them

219
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:37,900
and had found a while way 3G access

220
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,350
device like one little things that you
turn on and create an access point

221
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,650
and the militiamen had never seen
something like this but what happened

222
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,960
when they turn it on

223
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,910
is they see it start going you know
connecting to internet

224
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,029
satellite locate its broadcasting WiFi
and a

225
00:13:55,029 --> 00:13:59,490
decided that quite logically this must
be some sort of CIA spying device

226
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:02,560
and they arrested both the reporters and
then

227
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,060
al Jazeera had to go and sends arm

228
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:09,200
a bunch of people to negotiate the
release

229
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,800
so um one of the things that we have to
worry about

230
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,279
as a threat model is that of phone
cannot look weird

231
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,610
I anything that looks weird is going to
be issue to be a spy device

232
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:25,670
and this is part of cover so it can't be
a suspicious thing

233
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:29,010
so it has to be a device thats

234
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:32,290
a militiaman from and bar province

235
00:14:32,290 --> 00:14:35,860
who has grown up in a tiny village inn
is on the ever seen billboards

236
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:39,190
all recognize as a normal device

237
00:14:39,190 --> 00:14:43,589
which is why I've gone for %uh the Nexus
5 in the same thing as foreign things

238
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:44,970
like that

239
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:48,970
um but it's important to remember this
is not against the NSA

240
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,700
as it's not going to work against the
NSA

241
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:57,470
the other problem I have um so we have a
a threat model

242
00:14:57,470 --> 00:15:01,830
but we also have users

243
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:04,940
the problem of course is that security
is hard work it

244
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:09,690
really its painful to do it properly all
the time

245
00:15:09,690 --> 00:15:14,180
and it takes discipline and you have to
make sure that you do the same things

246
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,980
correctly in the same order

247
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:22,790
consistently otherwise you're going to
have problems

248
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:28,029
and the problem with that of course is
that users on lazy

249
00:15:28,029 --> 00:15:31,180
but you know solely

250
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,690
so that to be made easy to use

251
00:15:34,690 --> 00:15:38,120
such as arm there are actually nothing

252
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:41,200
there's nothing you can adjust I there's
no like

253
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,160
knobs it just works I it has to be
secured by default because they're not

254
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,899
going to configure its

255
00:15:47,899 --> 00:15:52,170
arm they don't know how to do that
properly

256
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:55,600
and it has to be reasonably good because
if the

257
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,070
defaults are too strong they're not
going to use its and if it's not strong

258
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:00,920
enough it's not going to help

259
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,580
so we're too can strike a balance there

260
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:09,930
alright now to completely switch track

261
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:13,899
burner phones this might be a solution I

262
00:16:13,899 --> 00:16:19,140
all you need to do is buy really cheap
phone and you can like use that

263
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:22,529
now you might be wondering what is a
burner phone good for

264
00:16:22,529 --> 00:16:27,350
well specifically burner phones are good
for threat actors that did not have

265
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,350
nation state level capabilities

266
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:34,180
for example the mall um

267
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:38,660
day are good for fleshing out a
non-operational legend

268
00:16:38,660 --> 00:16:42,250
so if you're creating a persona that is
not going to be used in a situation that

269
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,440
needs to have any sort of protection

270
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:47,980
you can use a burner phone that will
allow you to

271
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,980
I have a number that can be called

272
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,440
I so they're kind of good for that

273
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,490
but definitely not for the NSA I pretty
useless

274
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:04,069
at stopping an essay arm anyway you're
probably going to use them

275
00:17:04,069 --> 00:17:07,459
so which is what you should do up

276
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:11,569
basically most of the stuff or actually
all a bit

277
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:15,510
is taken from the skies blog and I have
no idea who he is cuz he's got good

278
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:16,120
object

279
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,420
so I am misappropriating it and

280
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:22,860
he can get in touch with me if he has a
problem

281
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:26,790
um when you're buying a burner phone

282
00:17:26,790 --> 00:17:30,790
that dahmer the better right I am I
particularly like the

283
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:35,260
Nokia 1280 because it has a week of
battery life

284
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:39,540
when it up and it has an LED flashlight
that you can use

285
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:42,910
and it also has an FM radio if your port
and

286
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:46,600
can make phone calls um

287
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,980
you need to learn how did actually turn
the thing off properly

288
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,470
what that really means you have to take
the SIM card out

289
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,510
and you have to remove the battery I
left at completely turn it off

290
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,559
arm anywhere that you going to be around
a location that is linked with you

291
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:07,420
as we went over you need to make sure
that in a disabled state

292
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:10,610
so never turn it on at home

293
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:14,320
arm when you are loading it up with
information

294
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,480
never ever put in real info I don't put
an actual contact information

295
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,210
don't fill it in with any information
that I is legitimately

296
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,580
tie to you or people that you know in
any way

297
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,020
similarly if you want to put in fake
information

298
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:34,370
go for it that's a good idea provides a
nice cover

299
00:18:34,370 --> 00:18:39,040
arm and it will all provide some

300
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:43,400
evidence that people can look at that
will distract them later on

301
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:47,390
I while you are using it you probably
want to also call non-operational

302
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:48,630
numbers

303
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:52,640
I so not just the people that you're
trying to get in contact with

304
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
but random other people to creates

305
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:59,320
a call tree that's not actually a unique
Mac

306
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:03,640
tied to you she basically want to chap
the analysis a little bit

307
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:07,059
are you wanna keep it very short join
keep it very simple

308
00:19:07,059 --> 00:19:11,140
and you want to get rid of it as soon as
possible so don't keep it around for

309
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:14,150
longer than you need it

310
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:18,830
arm when you're buying it purchases in
cash get it from small store

311
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:23,510
are one of the big things that screws up
and analysis on investigation

312
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:27,150
is time delta's so the longer that you
can wait

313
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:32,500
between purchase and use the better are
trying aim for a minimum of two months

314
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:37,700
but long is also good leave the longer
you wait the harder it is for them to

315
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:40,890
backtrack and go to the store and get
information

316
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:46,320
on that and when you dispose of it
disposable with extreme prejudice

317
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,140
so get the hammer out and smash that
mother fucker up

318
00:19:51,140 --> 00:19:56,860
K I also have a section on how to do
clandestine phone calls

319
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:00,790
arm and the reason you want that

320
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,080
is because if you do it wrong I you can
get

321
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:08,010
blown-up a probably only if you're a

322
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:11,470
you many goat herder or attending a you
many wedding

323
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:17,170
um so as we said the problem phones as
they are always on location trackers

324
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:21,410
audio visual sensors environmental
sensors link just la carte identity

325
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:24,910
and you carry around with you everywhere
you go fucking terrible

326
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:31,910
um

327
00:20:32,110 --> 00:20:35,460
so the important thing with the
clandestine phone call

328
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:39,030
is to have a plan before you you started
out taxi

329
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:42,230
know what you're going to say have
thought about it beforehand

330
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,770
don't be too specific don't be too
elaborate don't make too forced

331
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:50,150
try make the whole thing sounds natural
arm

332
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:53,320
game keep Shaw keep it simple

333
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:56,630
keep it natural I whenever possible

334
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:00,420
prefer signaling over operational data
so sickening is if

335
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:04,590
you say to someone I will call you and
then we should meets

336
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,820
tomorrow at twelve o'clock

337
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:11,380
you call them you just say hi it's me

338
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:15,220
and then you can hang up because that's
all you need to do

339
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:18,610
you don't need to provide any additional
operational information

340
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,730
so sickening is better if you can't do
signaling

341
00:21:21,730 --> 00:21:24,770
a prefer open coats open codes

342
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:28,820
are where you basically just have worked
substitution ce arm

343
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,730
ands are one of the important things
with open codes is

344
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:36,500
it's called a modular spurts not really
out what you do

345
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:41,480
is you for example if I say I will meet
you tomorrow at 8 p.m.

346
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:44,670
us I'll meet you on Friday at 8 p.m.

347
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:48,380
you subtract one day and one hour

348
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,410
subtract six hours and at one day

349
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,299
I so you have a very very simple
algorithm that's used

350
00:21:56,299 --> 00:22:00,480
modify any dayton time that to the other
party can use

351
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:05,570
so that if it is overheard it will be
the wrong information that is captured

352
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,650
arm these open codes can be very very
effective in all cases

353
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:14,690
arm one thing not to do

354
00:22:14,690 --> 00:22:17,840
is very very stupid open code such as

355
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:21,620
I would like to order to green sweaters
and make sure there aren't any fucking

356
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:25,520
seats this time

357
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,110
um and when you go in

358
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:32,400
once again make sure you have a plan
make sure you know what you're doing

359
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,150
I and of course

360
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,770
even if you do all this correctly the
other guy might fuck it up

361
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:42,780
so make sure that you tell 'em
beforehand

362
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:46,000
so that he doesn't go are tomorrow at 3

363
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,240
oh you mean 5 at the park see you then

364
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:54,650
I'm I can go very badly um

365
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:58,720
so those are the things that you should
do when you're making phone calls

366
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,870
and general I would suggest against
making phone calls for operational

367
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:04,830
reasons

368
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:08,220
some other things that people have come
up with to make secure phones

369
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,650
these like fortress phones where it's
gonna like stop the NSA

370
00:23:11,650 --> 00:23:15,170
arm

371
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:19,110
they don't really work very well but
we'll go over them anyway

372
00:23:19,110 --> 00:23:22,080
are so there's actually an essay kite
lines and how to have a secure phone

373
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,340
which is quite useful

374
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:26,850
because they published and we can copy
it

375
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:29,860
and fundamentally their guidelines are
very very sound

376
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,040
so everything has to have at these two
forms of encryption

377
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,320
so if you've got a ft

378
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,020
like 00 basically all the beauty rest
has to be interrupted

379
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:44,150
so full disk encryption but then every
application has to have its

380
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,540
own encryption on top of that so you
have to set up in corruption so if one

381
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,730
set of keys is compromised

382
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:54,010
in theory you at least up the second set
to protect you

383
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:58,110
i'm for data in motion it's the same
thing you need to have a base level of

384
00:23:58,110 --> 00:23:58,690
encryption

385
00:23:58,690 --> 00:24:02,070
and then the application to do
encryptions well on top of that

386
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:06,620
so this is very easy you have a VPN and
then you have your ap level

387
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:10,630
encryption on top of that so it's pretty
straightforward

388
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:14,030
to mimic some we can do this with all

389
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:18,750
open source stuff which is cool

390
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:22,679
but you can't really do it with and
right iight and there's a reason that

391
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:25,530
you cannot have a secure Android phone

392
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,730
number one it as a phone

393
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:33,840
number two it has Android

394
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,990
basically the the fundamental problem
with Android is it is the product of

395
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:42,549
a mass surveillance ad agency and they
are not of rent

396
00:24:42,549 --> 00:24:47,490
so they have gone to extreme lengths to
embed a lot of stuff that allows them to

397
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,290
monitor

398
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:52,980
what their phone is doing and that final
report quite a lot of stuff back

399
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:57,640
by default even if you go to extreme
lengths to make sure that you always

400
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:01,360
opt out of the things like up backup my
data

401
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,669
which is shorthand for upload all of my
data

402
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,100
in plain text to your servers because I
don't care about privacy

403
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,990
um the important thing to her remember
is that

404
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:16,860
leo's love Android Android is absolutely
terrible for you

405
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,900
at generate a huge amount of data it

406
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:23,440
uploads pretty much all over to Google
which means that even if your phone

407
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:28,000
is secure the date itself is not because
it's available that subpoena

408
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:32,700
and it is fundamentally just a Linux box
that is always connected to the Internet

409
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,360
that you cannot lock down in any way

410
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,450
arm and you might be thinking but what
if I install

411
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:44,549
text secure no you cannot bolt on
security

412
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:48,100
you cannot make and write better by
adding aP's

413
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,120
ok but what if I add more no

414
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,940
you cannot make Android better by
bolting on APs

415
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:59,870
it doesn't work what you have to do is
you have to start over from scratch

416
00:25:59,870 --> 00:26:04,370
completely built a wrong that is
designed to be secure

417
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,549
from the beginning um

418
00:26:07,549 --> 00:26:10,940
several people have done this so there's
black phone

419
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:14,549
a black phone is by silent circle it is

420
00:26:14,549 --> 00:26:18,290
coming out fairly soon and it's for
people with money

421
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,640
like it costs a 6-under box for the
phone

422
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,840
plus 100 bucks a year for a subscription

423
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,350
to their services which you need in
order to have at the secure texting

424
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:33,820
the secure calling and I obviously it
only works with other people who also

425
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,240
have black phones

426
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:40,380
or other silencer collapse so if you and
all of your friends are rich

427
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,610
one of these is probably a good way to
go um

428
00:26:43,610 --> 00:26:46,980
there's Samsung Knox which is for people
who

429
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:51,850
are do not actually want to secure phone
so if the problem is that's

430
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:55,980
you want a a phone that will have your
work email

431
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,500
that will be encrypt it separately from
your home email

432
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,929
and that will allow you to be PCI
compliance get a Samsung Knox

433
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:07,330
will be fine you can check the box on

434
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:11,370
PCI compliance I'm sure trust we would
be happy to help you with that

435
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:14,910
and once you get owns

436
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:18,080
you can say but I was calm yeah

437
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:22,179
anyway I Knox is absolute crap about the
threat model is basically

438
00:27:22,179 --> 00:27:27,049
I lost my phone gee I hope my email was
interrupted

439
00:27:27,049 --> 00:27:33,340
arm their is an open-source wrong that
was created for the Nexus 4

440
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,720
and one other model I think the s3

441
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:40,120
but I'll might be wrong on that so

442
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,760
the Guardian ROM up basically

443
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,760
it has a modified I

444
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,789
version of the volume answer

445
00:27:49,789 --> 00:27:54,030
that has a TrueCrypt like inner and
outer volume

446
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,559
built into it I in order to access the

447
00:27:57,559 --> 00:28:02,070
in a volume or the outer volume you have
to reboot the phone and type in your

448
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:03,450
password again

449
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:07,880
I'm so if you like to reboot phones

450
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:11,789
get the Guardian wrong arm

451
00:28:11,789 --> 00:28:16,059
then there's the one that I've built
which basically

452
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:20,470
a its it's very very happy right now it
hasn't been polished a lot

453
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:24,309
so if you want to do everything yourself
and then at least you'll know where you

454
00:28:24,309 --> 00:28:25,480
stand

455
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:31,730
go ahead and get a trip to Jen Mart I'll
point out that name is subject to change

456
00:28:31,730 --> 00:28:35,669
depending on whether they sue me or not
um

457
00:28:35,669 --> 00:28:40,520
as you might have guessed it is a
derivative up CyanogenMod

458
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:45,820
and you might be asking so is that and
as a proof

459
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:49,340
not so much

460
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,580
I all is lost

461
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:57,090
well we're not actually completely
fucked um

462
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:01,590
we can kind of do some things which is
why we've got trip to Jen Mart

463
00:29:01,590 --> 00:29:04,830
so it's the hardened and were drawn that
have developed

464
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,169
and I am going to run through my
presentation

465
00:29:08,169 --> 00:29:12,200
way too quickly I arm

466
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,000
I so

467
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:19,610
basically when I saw that works
Christian mobs the idea was to develop a

468
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:21,510
phone that would be able to defeat

469
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,860
local security forces so the idea was
not to develop

470
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,990
phone that would have a significant
protections

471
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:31,100
against I analysis from the telco side

472
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:35,630
but primarily from the physical access
sites up someone sees as your device

473
00:29:35,630 --> 00:29:39,080
it needs to be robust against those
attacks um

474
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,710
as a result there is quite a lot of
crypto that goes on

475
00:29:42,710 --> 00:29:46,169
like mock-up does better are it

476
00:29:46,169 --> 00:29:49,590
kinda screws up the usability little bit
like we figured out

477
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,169
that you need a minimum of 7 passwords

478
00:29:53,169 --> 00:29:57,429
in order to operate it securely now
we're working on reducing that a little

479
00:29:57,429 --> 00:29:58,289
bit

480
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:04,100
but arm we think at 7 passwords there's
some slight chance to be a little bit

481
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,910
every use

482
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:08,870
on the passwords there up

483
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:12,220
said its robust against physical attacks
um

484
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:15,539
the resilience against network attacks
is primarily thats

485
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:19,780
we don't want people to remotely on our
phone and the easiest way to do that

486
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:23,410
is to just get rid of everything that's
remotely honorable um

487
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:27,250
and also impact containment as I said
compartmentation

488
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:31,400
is a critical part of having a secure
phone

489
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:35,250
arm the way I've approached impact
containment is to limit the amount of

490
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:36,270
information

491
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,020
that is available to any application
it's installed on the phone

492
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:43,360
in theory that should limit the amount
of information

493
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,419
that someone can get if they install
malware

494
00:30:46,419 --> 00:30:49,929
on your phone arm in practice

495
00:30:49,929 --> 00:30:53,990
probably not but at least you tried I'm
so it's

496
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:58,799
a to refer to have of CyanogenMod Osama
Giamatti is pretty cool cuz I've still

497
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,870
got a whole lot of cool stuff already

498
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:06,090
I which makes my job easier arm I got
rid of even more of the Google stuff

499
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:09,919
so email client doesn't work

500
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,750
the browser doesn't work are the camera
doesn't work

501
00:31:13,750 --> 00:31:18,070
arm now there's a good things trust me

502
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:21,120
um I implied

503
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:26,190
the open P droit patches I O compete
right allows you to have

504
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,380
arm very very lockdown information
available by the API's in the framework

505
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:33,039
so when someone says

506
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,190
give me a list of all the contacts a
computer it goes

507
00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:40,530
should you go its Mt what a shock and it
does that for everything

508
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,679
so in some answers what is my IP address
a gozar

509
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,740
you're at 127 daughter to do not want
and if it's a

510
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:51,210
and if someone says give me the mac
Address echoes 22 22 22 22 22 22

511
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:55,490
et cetera so it's it's very good at
limiting the amount of information that

512
00:31:55,490 --> 00:31:57,250
can be scraped by

513
00:31:57,250 --> 00:32:01,250
at any particular application and I'm
hoping

514
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:05,070
that things like hacking teams now where
is going to use the

515
00:32:05,070 --> 00:32:09,090
Android API's rather than directly
reading from the disk

516
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:12,970
but we'll see and then I've installed

517
00:32:12,970 --> 00:32:17,370
a secure replacements so now we're using
whisper push

518
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:22,000
which comes by default with other phone
unfortunately

519
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,890
whisper push requires the Google Play
Framework and I do not like Google

520
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:30,230
so arm it doesn't quite work right now

521
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:33,620
the same thing with red phone we're
going to have to figure out a way around

522
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,710
that

523
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:38,940
so arm currently the only thing that
actually works

524
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:42,520
is the PTP email client which is great

525
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,390
because the only thing at this phone is
supposed to do is provide

526
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,659
secure communications over p2p email

527
00:32:50,659 --> 00:32:55,289
and a mentor to be like that as opposed
to accidentally broke everything

528
00:32:55,289 --> 00:32:58,330
um there's also a bunch of tweets that
I've done

529
00:32:58,330 --> 00:33:02,240
to harden the kernel so arm

530
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,510
things that I've done include adding
more encryption options so the default

531
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:08,669
settings for the kernel to not to be
very good

532
00:33:08,669 --> 00:33:13,000
I've stripped out support for things I
don't like such as an FCM Bluetooth

533
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:16,179
and I have also added some

534
00:33:16,179 --> 00:33:19,289
basically tripwire so that's

535
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:22,860
if there's any access to for example the
UAE RT

536
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,870
I have someone tries to attach a
debugger the

537
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:29,289
colonel will automatically panic or if
someone

538
00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:33,260
tries to attached to the debug port over
the

539
00:33:33,260 --> 00:33:38,770
arm the line in it will automatically
panic so won't allow any serial access

540
00:33:38,770 --> 00:33:39,940
to itself

541
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:44,250
so other kernels been heartened there
there's a lot more to be done

542
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,409
I've gots a a subset of the GR sec

543
00:33:47,409 --> 00:33:51,400
patches but I have not successfully
applied them

544
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,409
and gotten it to boot Sunday San um the
use land has been heartened

545
00:33:56,409 --> 00:34:00,100
again primarily by removing things arm

546
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:04,309
there's a lot more to be done I what I'm
most interested in doing is getting rid

547
00:34:04,309 --> 00:34:05,360
of deal malek

548
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:08,829
and replacing with a hardened version of
are

549
00:34:08,829 --> 00:34:12,999
like the JL malek or the JE Malott

550
00:34:12,999 --> 00:34:16,829
whenever the dudes name is arm and that
would make

551
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:20,049
the phone fundamentally more robust
against

552
00:34:20,049 --> 00:34:24,299
heap overflow attacks although again as
I said the only thing that actually

553
00:34:24,299 --> 00:34:24,799
works

554
00:34:24,799 --> 00:34:28,479
is Open VPN and the PGP clients

555
00:34:28,479 --> 00:34:33,529
I tore and chat secure

556
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:38,229
so there's quite a lot of protections
actually built into the phone

557
00:34:38,229 --> 00:34:42,039
up by itself

558
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:45,190
um things against local physical access

559
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:49,210
thanks again to mock packing things
against baseband hacking not so much

560
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,690
and network monitoring little bit and
GSM monitoring

561
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:56,969
not so much I'll primary concern with
physical access

562
00:34:56,969 --> 00:35:00,309
is people doing friends ex analysis and

563
00:35:00,309 --> 00:35:03,450
I all the security there is built around

564
00:35:03,450 --> 00:35:07,210
encryption and what I call the security
ratchet

565
00:35:07,210 --> 00:35:10,229
although I should come up with a much
better name so

566
00:35:10,229 --> 00:35:13,979
%uh secure atcha is this or something
that the text changes to the operational

567
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:14,489
environment

568
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:17,789
and automatically hardens the phone for
you arm

569
00:35:17,789 --> 00:35:21,019
more on that later remotely

570
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,390
what we've got years a very very reduced

571
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:28,710
attack surface and we achieve this by
stripping out the browser

572
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,849
like I if you're using Android
fundamentally

573
00:35:31,849 --> 00:35:36,249
your number one exposure is the browser
WebKit is where you're going to get

574
00:35:36,249 --> 00:35:37,130
aren't

575
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:40,210
and if it's not WebKit is going to be
over your email

576
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:44,469
which will also use WebKit and will use
I'm like

577
00:35:44,469 --> 00:35:48,640
HTML views or Web views too few things
that's bad

578
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:52,229
and I also got rid of the App Store's
because

579
00:35:52,229 --> 00:35:55,940
if you allow users to install things
they will and that will fuck everything

580
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:57,309
up because

581
00:35:57,309 --> 00:36:01,009
now that's what users do so I removed
the ability to

582
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:04,900
to alter the device in any way

583
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:08,789
um so back basically covers you

584
00:36:08,789 --> 00:36:13,920
locally and remotely um in terms of
baseband attacks there's not much I can

585
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,799
do without developing my own phone from
scratch

586
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:21,469
which I am NOT going to do you can use
portal

587
00:36:21,469 --> 00:36:25,869
so you disable the GSM completely and
only use wifi access

588
00:36:25,869 --> 00:36:30,249
to a separate device that what then
provide tore only access

589
00:36:30,249 --> 00:36:33,400
and that would have its own a GSM stack

590
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:37,099
which would connect outs to the network
and that would give you an air gap

591
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:39,569
between your phone and the network

592
00:36:39,569 --> 00:36:43,390
I that's one thing you can do its

593
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,839
is a little bit bulky and in terms of
carrying it around but it's very very

594
00:36:46,839 --> 00:36:47,910
secure

595
00:36:47,910 --> 00:36:51,089
so I don't think it's a terrible idea um

596
00:36:51,089 --> 00:36:55,039
the other thing to remember is that even
know baseband attacks are a threat

597
00:36:55,039 --> 00:36:58,640
it's not actually the end of the world
up baseband attacks

598
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:03,019
are kinda finicky like they're they're
not very reliable all the time because

599
00:37:03,019 --> 00:37:04,279
it's very very dependent

600
00:37:04,279 --> 00:37:08,749
on the version of the firmware that you
have and that's hard to fingerprint

601
00:37:08,749 --> 00:37:11,839
arm and they also

602
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:15,489
not depend very much on the design of
the baseband so if the baseband was

603
00:37:15,489 --> 00:37:18,839
designed correctly where actually is
properly segmented

604
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:22,369
from the rest the phone in theory it's
not the end of the world because the

605
00:37:22,369 --> 00:37:24,059
only thing that you are doing

606
00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:27,670
is using the phone to get internet
access so it only ever season could to

607
00:37:27,670 --> 00:37:29,109
traffic anyway

608
00:37:29,109 --> 00:37:33,219
I'm in practice of course a lot of pay
stands up badly designs

609
00:37:33,219 --> 00:37:37,039
and if you're at the baseband you can do
read access

610
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:41,460
to the rest the phone's memory which
kinda screws encryption

611
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,569
badly so up

612
00:37:44,569 --> 00:37:48,349
basebands there's not much we can do use
a portal

613
00:37:48,349 --> 00:37:53,009
ands that solves that issue arm

614
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:56,599
in terms of network monitoring and GSM
monitoring

615
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:59,910
I there's nothing we can do about GSM
monitoring because

616
00:37:59,910 --> 00:38:03,349
you are on the GSM network except again
using a portal

617
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,369
arm in terms of network monitoring if
you're using a VPN so that you only ever

618
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,519
connect to

619
00:38:09,519 --> 00:38:13,569
a single back-end you are secure from
monitoring that because you're

620
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:14,430
interested

621
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:18,089
and there's no pattern that can be
matched your not leaving a lot of

622
00:38:18,089 --> 00:38:19,390
meta-data

623
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:23,079
so I V pins good and

624
00:38:23,079 --> 00:38:26,210
it also automatically gives us out you
aware of encryption

625
00:38:26,210 --> 00:38:30,519
so there's quite a lot of things in
there that make the phone

626
00:38:30,519 --> 00:38:35,279
automatically more robust of course you
have to be smart as well

627
00:38:35,279 --> 00:38:38,700
Mike you need to employ your up sex
because

628
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,390
even if you've gotten into phone if you
automatically use it to tell people

629
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,549
where you are

630
00:38:43,549 --> 00:38:50,210
it's not going to help you so yeah
secure phones can secure stupid

631
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,609
so that was quick to Jen Mart on the
other thing I did was I created an

632
00:38:53,609 --> 00:38:54,839
application called

633
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:58,029
dark matter so talk about a creates

634
00:38:58,029 --> 00:39:03,219
a arm a setup secure application
containers

635
00:39:03,219 --> 00:39:06,880
so these are encrypted containers that
applications run from

636
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:10,690
and it also ensures that there is a
secure operational environments

637
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:14,910
but the phone is running in so the
cryptid ap containers

638
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,160
our arm basically

639
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:22,969
its true crypt I so we have a mobile
version of true crypt

640
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:26,109
which allows you to create a TrueCrypt
volume

641
00:39:26,109 --> 00:39:29,140
on your farm I it will

642
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:34,599
when you mount your volume automatically
kills all of your sensitive applications

643
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:39,210
it will Pines mount them into your
TrueCrypt volume

644
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,450
and then when you restart them all of
the data will appear

645
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:45,619
inside of the TrueCrypt volume

646
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:48,779
so this gives you a second layer
encryption

647
00:39:48,779 --> 00:39:53,450
I so everything that's running is now
running out of a TrueCrypt volume

648
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,719
arm because true crips I

649
00:39:56,719 --> 00:39:59,880
for Android is kinda broken

650
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:04,019
there's one person other that you can
get with an app called kryptonite

651
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:07,450
are the TrueCrypt sources use fuse

652
00:40:07,450 --> 00:40:11,289
and the FAT filesystem so fat we on our
scrap

653
00:40:11,289 --> 00:40:15,609
fuses actually really terrible arm

654
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:19,130
there is a problem where if you

655
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:22,619
unmount arm a fuse

656
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,809
like a true curfews a filesystem
actually

657
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:29,819
only announced the mount point but the

658
00:40:29,819 --> 00:40:34,190
temporary location where it has mounted
initially is left open

659
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:37,719
what that means is if you open a
TrueCrypt volume

660
00:40:37,719 --> 00:40:42,309
and then close it all of the data is
still left they're completely accessible

661
00:40:42,309 --> 00:40:45,789
until you reboot the device right

662
00:40:45,789 --> 00:40:48,799
it is the opposite of useful so

663
00:40:48,799 --> 00:40:52,430
I used to an application call TC play
which was

664
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:55,459
written for I think dragonfly BSD

665
00:40:55,459 --> 00:40:59,400
but possibly NetBSD I am it's completely
open source

666
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,660
it has no back doors as far as anyone
knows

667
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,359
arm the only connection has with
TrueCrypt is that it uses the TrueCrypt

668
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:07,930
file formats

669
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,299
arm which is not a great fall format but
at least it's interoperable with other

670
00:41:12,299 --> 00:41:13,180
things

671
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,959
and it gives you that inner and outer
container

672
00:41:16,959 --> 00:41:23,959
so me

673
00:41:24,390 --> 00:41:30,859
yes

674
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:31,550
um as

675
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:35,020
I don't know if it works for other PC as
well I suspect

676
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:38,599
it doesn't but it definitely doesn't
Android so

677
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:41,869
thats its arm the guy thats

678
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:45,890
modified TrueCrypt to run on Android
wrote a bunch of patches

679
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:50,119
where he hardcoded a bunch of things
just in order to get to compile

680
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:55,430
arm so he just went their own is like if
def def def whatever dddd dddd dddd

681
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,530
put in the past year baboon great

682
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:02,250
done and somehow he ended up with us

683
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:05,580
the result that I TrueCrypt doesn't
actually I'm out

684
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,730
so if you get a phone and

685
00:42:08,730 --> 00:42:12,060
arm you see the trip refinery on their
look

686
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:16,550
under St cart android data sesh to
kryptonite dot

687
00:42:16,550 --> 00:42:21,270
on Nats slash I don't be a top temp
directory

688
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,470
and insight there you will find all of
the mounts

689
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:27,960
directories where there to protect is
available

690
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:31,650
arm you can also see that if you just
type mounts

691
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,980
because they will show up I think it its

692
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:39,109
pretty horrible so the awesome thing
about TC play is it uses DM crypt

693
00:42:39,109 --> 00:42:42,150
which is that device mapper so it's
actually all done

694
00:42:42,150 --> 00:42:45,220
internal so it's not unusual and it
makes a lot faster

695
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:49,750
arm because it's done in the kernel it
makes it a lot less broken

696
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:53,070
and because it's also done in the kernel
with the device mapper that allows you

697
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:53,930
to use

698
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:57,510
real filesystems so you can use ext4

699
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:01,330
and set up at and fat actually doesn't
work very well

700
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:05,230
for Linux applications when they're
trying to save data and so on because

701
00:43:05,230 --> 00:43:07,170
you can't set the permissions properly

702
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:11,000
where's ext4 is absolutely fine arm

703
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,570
ants obviously you could do things like
at Rice rough ass

704
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:18,680
and that would allow you to kill your
wife with your phone um

705
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:21,770
one person claps

706
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:26,790
killing the wife okay and you might be
wondering

707
00:43:26,790 --> 00:43:32,460
but why don't I just use the shitty AES
128 CBC that comes with a Android anyway

708
00:43:32,460 --> 00:43:35,570
and why what I use the far superior AES
256

709
00:43:35,570 --> 00:43:39,990
SCS wrote that comes with TrueCrypt but
the answer is

710
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,480
ok use boss why not I make him work for
it

711
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:47,260
arm having both set to be corruption

712
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:51,950
doesn't at a mass amount of slowing down
because most Android app saw not I owe

713
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:52,760
about

714
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,640
they don't spend a lot of time running
back and forth up and down the

715
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,130
the encryption stack arm of course one
of the other things that

716
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:04,250
is important to notice is that the basic

717
00:44:04,250 --> 00:44:09,130
a slash data encryption that you can get
with Android is tied to your unlock

718
00:44:09,130 --> 00:44:13,520
encoding I'm not pass code so if you
want to have a secure

719
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,690
a slash data I encryption

720
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,810
and you also want to have a relatively
easy to use pin

721
00:44:20,810 --> 00:44:24,790
unlock code arm you need to use

722
00:44:24,790 --> 00:44:28,070
a another application which will wrap
around the

723
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:32,230
VDC command which is the a volume just
control or something like that

724
00:44:32,230 --> 00:44:35,790
and that will allow you to change the
boot password

725
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:39,540
to unlock your slash data so I have
included that

726
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,210
on the farm because you really do need
to have a secure boot password

727
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:47,580
because that's what's going to get
background by the

728
00:44:47,580 --> 00:44:50,970
like when I start doing would force
that's what they're going to be brute

729
00:44:50,970 --> 00:44:51,450
force

730
00:44:51,450 --> 00:44:54,849
and if it's 1234 it's not going to last
very long

731
00:44:54,849 --> 00:44:58,640
um so for us

732
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:01,680
I'll because about our physical

733
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:06,410
phone security and the amount of
encryption we have there are

734
00:45:06,410 --> 00:45:10,030
a very very arm small number of women
States

735
00:45:10,030 --> 00:45:15,130
we need to get basically as soon as
wanna bankrupted containers is closed

736
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:20,220
we win and that's very very easy for us
all we need to do

737
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:25,050
is shut down one other containers and
now someone has to brute-force

738
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,520
a TrueCrypt I password which is a lot
more difficult

739
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:33,320
than I the as: passwords that gets used
on the

740
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:36,950
arm time corruption because that's not
actually up

741
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,640
very well protected and of course

742
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,250
a shutdown or reboot counts as well so
if we can get the phone to shut down

743
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:49,150
we win I so

744
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,460
those a round trip to containers arm

745
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:55,540
what makes this particularly awesome is
that they're is

746
00:45:55,540 --> 00:46:00,020
events based heartening so not only to
be having troops containers

747
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:04,950
but our phone actually monitors and
adapt our security posture

748
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:08,580
based on changes within the operational
environment

749
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:12,220
so it will detect when people are trying
to do nasty things or when there are

750
00:46:12,220 --> 00:46:13,400
indicators

751
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:17,040
of nasty things and it will
automatically hearten itself

752
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:21,050
but what this comes down to is its are
monitoring

753
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:26,119
for security events when there are
security events

754
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,619
it will trigger security actions

755
00:46:29,619 --> 00:46:36,150
pretty straightforward right

756
00:46:36,150 --> 00:46:40,619
so um there's a few things that we look
for in particular that we treat as

757
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:44,130
indicators of a negative operational
environment

758
00:46:44,130 --> 00:46:48,119
arm these are

759
00:46:48,119 --> 00:46:52,410
if there is a failed login attempts so
someone has access to your phone and

760
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:54,580
they put in the wrong pin

761
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:57,640
this will automatically unmount
everything all shots

762
00:46:57,640 --> 00:47:01,800
your encrypts containers also kill all
of the applications

763
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:04,810
and you get to restart them in if
they're pass a protected

764
00:47:04,810 --> 00:47:09,440
yet at those in as well so this gives us
a very very easy way

765
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,750
of triggering ATI trip to contain a
close

766
00:47:13,750 --> 00:47:18,319
we can we can reach a win state simply
by putting in the incorrect pin

767
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:21,790
arm is also timorese so

768
00:47:21,790 --> 00:47:25,150
right now the time rice sets to 10 hours

769
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:29,369
I believe so if no one logged in
successfully within 10 hours

770
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:33,109
it will automatically lock the phone dow
at the reason this is useful

771
00:47:33,109 --> 00:47:37,980
is in the majority of cases unless you
are a high-value targets

772
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:41,450
your phone is just going to go on the
stack until someone gets around to

773
00:47:41,450 --> 00:47:42,800
looking at

774
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:46,580
arm that can be a week or more

775
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:50,119
I'll we also detect a temperature drop

776
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:53,150
so if the phone starts a

777
00:47:53,150 --> 00:47:57,030
going down towards freezing for over one
hour

778
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:00,760
then it will automatically and mount
some reason for this is that's

779
00:48:00,760 --> 00:48:04,520
I cold boot attacks on Android can't be
done by throwing the phone

780
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:08,609
in the freezer I so we detect that

781
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:12,950
we also detect radio silence which is if
there is no GSM connections

782
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:16,510
no wifi connection we assume that you're
in a Faraday back

783
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:19,540
if you're on a Friday back you've been
seized and you're going to be friends

784
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,130
we analyzed we shut down

785
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:26,330
up I mentioned there were the
modifications

786
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,910
the kernel which detect when there's a
debugger that's been attached

787
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:35,119
arm if there's a debugger attached up by
any of the physical ports

788
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:39,760
the kernel panics we reboot or shutdown
and that's a win

789
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,190
arm so we also

790
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,080
can receive alerts suffering receive an
alert SMS

791
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,099
we will shutdown and reboot that's a win

792
00:48:50,099 --> 00:48:54,720
so i'm for us if someone frantically
sees as your phone

793
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,750
they put it in a fair day back we detect
that

794
00:48:57,750 --> 00:49:00,810
we shut down we win ago haha

795
00:49:00,810 --> 00:49:04,030
I know about this no found a bag for you

796
00:49:04,030 --> 00:49:07,960
we can now send an alert SMS and shut
down and when

797
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,080
if they go %ah I'm not falling for that
one

798
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:16,099
I'll just take the SIM card out well we
detect that we shut down we went

799
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:19,920
I like there's basically no we have
access in the phone without having your

800
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,880
password

801
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,560
which means the phone is about as hard
as a king gets

802
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:27,960
up to you so up those be

803
00:49:27,960 --> 00:49:31,400
those the events that its I monitoring
for

804
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,480
some of them are done with third-party
applications right now

805
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:39,960
arm I am paying a guy who writes the
Java code because I refuse to write Java

806
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,619
for religious reasons

807
00:49:41,619 --> 00:49:46,140
and Zach I thank you thank you

808
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:49,180
i've seen the light um yeah

809
00:49:49,180 --> 00:49:52,319
and up basically

810
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:56,369
she is not as motivated as it should be
because I've been a little bit late in

811
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:57,089
paying him

812
00:49:57,089 --> 00:50:00,560
because he has not been as motivated as
they should be

813
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:03,900
so the beatings will continue until
morale improves

814
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,880
one of us has to give um

815
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,450
at the things that we do that hearten
security posture are

816
00:50:11,450 --> 00:50:15,580
week you all the sensitive applications
right now that's a hard-coded list

817
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:19,000
so it means was proposed tax secure et
phone

818
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,100
arm you are shemale to and

819
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:26,380
a your chat secure so these are things
that would have information a memory

820
00:50:26,380 --> 00:50:29,390
that would be useful we kill those

821
00:50:29,390 --> 00:50:32,850
we unmount the took a filesystem so

822
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:36,040
that gets closed how we can also white

823
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:40,260
files so if the security ratchet gets a
certain level

824
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:43,569
we would be able to completely erase the
I

825
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:48,200
TrueCrypt volume container so that will
be there for someone to see after its

826
00:50:48,200 --> 00:50:51,400
arm its built-in right now that has a
Wagner

827
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:56,290
a ram wipe so assumes it's killed
everything it will also why pram

828
00:50:56,290 --> 00:51:00,170
in the hopes that it will I erase any
memory

829
00:51:00,170 --> 00:51:04,299
that has like decryption keys our
passports still left in it

830
00:51:04,299 --> 00:51:07,700
I tried to modify tell Vic so that
whenever

831
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,339
freeze objects it would memset a 20

832
00:51:11,339 --> 00:51:15,600
but II could not make that work and then
I assumed fuck it

833
00:51:15,600 --> 00:51:20,650
artist at an application instead um it's
also possible to reboot the phone

834
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:24,700
but since we've pretty much done all of
that there's no point in having a reboot

835
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,710
at this point in time

836
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:30,960
um before I gets the demo a quick note
on

837
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,109
arrest coats us the people of us like

838
00:51:34,109 --> 00:51:37,609
why don't you have a dress code that you
could key in specific pin

839
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:40,770
and it would automatically do bad things
to your phone

840
00:51:40,770 --> 00:51:45,069
are the reason for that is that when you
have a rest code

841
00:51:45,069 --> 00:51:48,180
it doesn't work because you're going to
say to someone

842
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,859
here are two pin numbers one you're
going to use all the time

843
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:56,410
and this other one you're only going to
use when you're under extreme stress

844
00:51:56,410 --> 00:51:59,750
don't get them confused and don't forget
it I

845
00:51:59,750 --> 00:52:03,369
that doesn't work people forget it um
during world war 2

846
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:06,510
the radio operators that were actually
trained on how to do

847
00:52:06,510 --> 00:52:09,530
dress code stuff would still screwed up
occasionally

848
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:13,560
and these are people who are trained
these not like random reporters doing

849
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:14,660
stuff

850
00:52:14,660 --> 00:52:18,010
um additionally

851
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:21,470
with the dress code watching to what
tends to happen is

852
00:52:21,470 --> 00:52:25,970
when you used the wrong code you have
extreme punishment

853
00:52:25,970 --> 00:52:29,060
right so when there's a dress code for

854
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:32,980
an alarm at your house when you put in
the wrong number the police show up

855
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,020
and that you get a huge bill from the
alarm company

856
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:40,010
so it's not generally a very good thing

857
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,080
um or while

858
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:47,510
they don't work other any questions on
dress codes

859
00:52:47,510 --> 00:52:51,760
now okay now the demo

860
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:55,109
I'll can everyone see that at the back
yeah

861
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:59,720
K I'm gonna unlock

862
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:02,770
yeah up

863
00:53:02,770 --> 00:53:07,540
I made a video I

864
00:53:07,540 --> 00:53:11,970
arm so that's my super secret PIN number

865
00:53:11,970 --> 00:53:16,220
here's my chat secure its got a white
background

866
00:53:16,220 --> 00:53:20,750
here's my are two mail two are two mail
two is a p2p clients

867
00:53:20,750 --> 00:53:26,609
arm we open up doc matter we enter our
super secret passwords

868
00:53:26,609 --> 00:53:32,839
don't look

869
00:53:32,839 --> 00:53:37,069
up arm

870
00:53:37,069 --> 00:53:40,130
now we open arch email to a game

871
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,270
and because running from inside the
encrypted container it will have a black

872
00:53:43,270 --> 00:53:45,650
background because as a different setup
settings

873
00:53:45,650 --> 00:53:50,089
such a visual cue to us to know that
we're in a secure States

874
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:54,109
it's the same thing for chat secure how
we came close

875
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:57,410
dark matter which will arm you know

876
00:53:57,410 --> 00:54:01,569
posting two containers and see what back
to whites Obama

877
00:54:01,569 --> 00:54:07,200
so whites yes nothing up my sleeves

878
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,930
once again don't look the password is
not possible on

879
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:16,869
arm well above a bar

880
00:54:16,869 --> 00:54:19,910
I type a lot faster in real life in
there isn't a camera directly in front

881
00:54:19,910 --> 00:54:23,140
my face

882
00:54:23,140 --> 00:54:26,530
now it close I and if we

883
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:30,250
login incorrectly oh no mister
militiaman

884
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:37,150
I fat fingered the passport my bad

885
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:40,200
all look at that on trip to containers
have been

886
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,680
unmounted and we are back to our

887
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:49,339
decoy state so that gives us a very very
easy to rest code in that

888
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:52,910
the only thing you need to remember is
do not use the correct PIN number

889
00:54:52,910 --> 00:54:59,660
and you're safe yeah that's the easiest
possible to rest

890
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:02,920
so fuck yeah trip to Jen mod

891
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:07,569
plus stock matter pure fucking win

892
00:55:07,569 --> 00:55:11,450
arm and its open source you can go and
get it

893
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:16,490
on get up as soon as I take this not
private which will happen after this

894
00:55:16,490 --> 00:55:21,260
arm and the important thing is that this
slot will not

895
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:24,869
actually defeat the NSA it will make it
more expensive

896
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:28,400
so you can hit them where it counts

897
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:33,190
probably until they attacked

898
00:55:33,190 --> 00:55:39,030
arm so what motivated this was that as
we know journalists are being hit

899
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:43,359
very heavily by a nation state actors
that

900
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:47,119
wants to access they information that
they've been collecting

901
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,859
I'll we have known this for a while
they're starting to figure this out

902
00:55:50,859 --> 00:55:54,049
arm and so al Jazeera

903
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:57,680
contacted me to help them with a device

904
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:01,490
that would protect them against this and
they had one condition

905
00:56:01,490 --> 00:56:05,180
that it was made available for everyone
because they want

906
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:09,660
ever want to be using a secure phone so
they've decided that if there's a strong

907
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,920
base line up security for everyone

908
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:16,430
we all benefit so thank you al Jazeera

909
00:56:16,430 --> 00:56:19,780
other any questions

910
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:23,280
this doesn't seem to address the initial
problem which is

911
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:26,839
arm the Al Jazeera team going in with
spying equipment

912
00:56:26,839 --> 00:56:30,619
initially and this doesn't have Angry
Birds on it

913
00:56:30,619 --> 00:56:34,770
and a whole bunch of other important
applications that are clear indications

914
00:56:34,770 --> 00:56:38,200
love not being a spy app um yeah wall

915
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,589
book what basically triggered the it's a
spy app

916
00:56:41,589 --> 00:56:45,720
was it was just something that looked
weird that they hadn't seen before

917
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:49,089
I'm you're correct in that it doesn't
have very good cover

918
00:56:49,089 --> 00:56:52,880
I like if it's got nothing but trip to
stuff and has no App Store it does look

919
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,869
pretty bad

920
00:56:53,869 --> 00:56:57,299
I'm in discussions with Al Jazeera about

921
00:56:57,299 --> 00:57:02,220
whether to add the Google Play Store and
allow people to modify the phone

922
00:57:02,220 --> 00:57:05,839
and make it look more normal I'm very
much against that because I think if

923
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,630
people modified things then they will
make it in secure because that's what

924
00:57:08,630 --> 00:57:09,819
people do

925
00:57:09,819 --> 00:57:14,190
arm whereas say you want their reporters
actually

926
00:57:14,190 --> 00:57:19,080
use the phone and if it doesn't have to
know like Angry Birds on it then

927
00:57:19,080 --> 00:57:22,650
you know the report will be like well I
could use a secure phone or I could use

928
00:57:22,650 --> 00:57:25,450
my regular phone which has Angry Birds

929
00:57:25,450 --> 00:57:28,650
so yeah like this some discussions over
that your rights

930
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:32,119
arm i think is a baseline for

931
00:57:32,119 --> 00:57:35,940
a hacker that wants to use this as a
platform

932
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,740
to build their own personal secure phone
it's pretty good

933
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:44,640
arm it gets you somewhere reasonable as
a baseline that you can build on

934
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,599
to I address whichever issues you must
concerned with

935
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:51,790
arm making its compliant with a

936
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:55,510
this is not a secure phone not not like
nudge nudge wink wink

937
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,530
that's possible so arm

938
00:57:58,530 --> 00:58:03,859
yeah like as I said that could happen
with the actual devices that deliver to

939
00:58:03,859 --> 00:58:05,520
them

940
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:09,609
because they're the customer and they
want that but I've gone for the bare

941
00:58:09,609 --> 00:58:10,660
minimum

942
00:58:10,660 --> 00:58:15,290
for the public release thank you grow if
there is a real name

943
00:58:15,290 --> 00:58:18,390
power actually it's thaddeus but don't
tell anyone

944
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:23,140
so when he panicked the kernel mmm say
you put in the USB cable

945
00:58:23,140 --> 00:58:26,900
does that and enable call good at PAX
because then you can order started

946
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,900
racing stuff

947
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,109
in theory yes but they would have to

948
00:58:31,109 --> 00:58:34,470
called like that have to make a call
first arm

949
00:58:34,470 --> 00:58:37,609
its like it's not perfect butts

950
00:58:37,609 --> 00:58:40,740
I E don't know how to do things like

951
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:44,880
arm what's more so the x86 distributions
to

952
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:48,529
like tails and liberty Linux either way
that they

953
00:58:48,529 --> 00:58:52,720
enable cold boot prevention is the use
mem test

954
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:57,069
I 86 which best the wipes RAM as a goes

955
00:58:57,069 --> 00:59:00,790
so they do a colonel exact like a exact
to

956
00:59:00,790 --> 00:59:04,660
a mem test and then that runs through
and wipes RAM

957
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:08,290
before it shuts down arm

958
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:12,529
I do not know how to do that on our if
someone wants to

959
00:59:12,529 --> 00:59:16,230
figure that out and then I will at the
patch to that

960
00:59:16,230 --> 00:59:19,680
and it would defeat that attack as well
ike

961
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,290
that is a thing I would like to have
butts it would require

962
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:26,850
a lot more are like Linux kernel
development

963
00:59:26,850 --> 00:59:30,880
and arm development experience than I
have particularly within the time frame

964
00:59:30,880 --> 00:59:32,630
that this project at two

965
00:59:32,630 --> 00:59:36,270
I'll to become operational so I just
went with panic

966
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:39,520
because I figure the odds are that
someone's going to see if they're going

967
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:40,560
to plug in their début

968
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:44,670
cable the phones gonna panic and think
ago ok shit

969
00:59:44,670 --> 00:59:48,009
a better try something else now that

970
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:51,920
that's the hope and its on going to work
as long as no one sees

971
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,440
the slide deck for this video and
doesn't know about

972
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,740
so don't tell anyone

973
00:59:58,740 --> 01:00:02,880
a key Anna follow-up question say the
reporters they've written up along

974
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,710
thing on the computer he at the one
transmit back their way for them to get

975
01:00:06,710 --> 01:00:08,230
it to go through the phone

976
01:00:08,230 --> 01:00:11,660
given to you can planet in I no

977
01:00:11,660 --> 01:00:17,020
currently not butts a developing a
secure computer would be

978
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:22,100
n other thing like so far the stuff but
they basically wanted was they wanted

979
01:00:22,100 --> 01:00:25,339
a arm a secure communications platform

980
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:28,830
for calling back to the head office and
for doing

981
01:00:28,830 --> 01:00:32,790
email work remotely arm but not for
developing

982
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,420
0 basically writing and submitting
stories they they also are very upset

983
01:00:36,420 --> 01:00:38,140
that the camera doesn't work

984
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:40,990
and they don't understand why the camera
shouldn't work because cameras take

985
01:00:40,990 --> 01:00:43,200
pictures of things and that's bad

986
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:47,240
but you now the reporters what are they
now yes so my question is the

987
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,850
what are your plans for updates or
patches are making sure you get badges

988
01:00:50,850 --> 01:00:52,339
from senator mod

989
01:00:52,339 --> 01:00:55,700
arm basically because they're

990
01:00:55,700 --> 01:00:58,819
is likely to be an ongoing contact for
this

991
01:00:58,819 --> 01:01:02,640
I am going to continue working on it on
particular if there's

992
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,670
interest from the community and people
like

993
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:09,440
stock getting involved with that then
will be a lot easier

994
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,190
otherwise it will die on the vine

995
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:17,460
but for now you can get a like a Nexus 5
you can load up

996
01:01:17,460 --> 01:01:20,990
I CyanogenMod psyched up to Jen mod and
at

997
01:01:20,990 --> 01:01:24,950
dark matter arm what you can also do is
you could take

998
01:01:24,950 --> 01:01:28,880
a stock CyanogenMod phone I you will
have to add

999
01:01:28,880 --> 01:01:32,160
XTS to the kernel are because thats
requirement

1000
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:36,619
for archer crips and it's not there by
default

1001
01:01:36,619 --> 01:01:40,420
which is unfortunate but otherwise it
the swift a doc matter

1002
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:44,880
by itself would work on stock
CyanogenMod phone

1003
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:49,009
which is something I would like to get
like I'd like to get to that state

1004
01:01:49,009 --> 01:01:52,700
so if they which at XTS into their
default kernel

1005
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:55,990
then doc I would work out of the box

1006
01:01:55,990 --> 01:02:00,480
on their devices and you would have
pretty much all of those protections

1007
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:03,569
arm just on a standard CyanogenMod farm

1008
01:02:03,569 --> 01:02:07,410
which would be pretty good like I i
would like

1009
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:10,819
dark matter to be in the Play Store at
some point that's

1010
01:02:10,819 --> 01:02:14,279
right now it's basically a 300 line
shell scripts

1011
01:02:14,279 --> 01:02:18,060
and Java GUI so I don't think that's
going to be accepted

1012
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:21,619
and also requires root because does
mounds and mounds

1013
01:02:21,619 --> 01:02:27,049
which you know I would like it not to
require those things because I want to

1014
01:02:27,049 --> 01:02:27,980
get rid of the

1015
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:32,990
SU binary completely but that is not
possible at this time

1016
01:02:32,990 --> 01:02:37,460
but yeah like dark matter should be
should be the thing

1017
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:40,859
arm that you can use regardless of
whether

1018
01:02:40,859 --> 01:02:44,799
crips jan-mar survives or not so dark
matter

1019
01:02:44,799 --> 01:02:48,080
good John Mott plus dark matter better
but yeah

1020
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,170
dark matter could by itself
