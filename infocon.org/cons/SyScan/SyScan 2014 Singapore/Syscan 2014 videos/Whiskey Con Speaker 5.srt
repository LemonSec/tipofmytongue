1
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:05,040
so I'm from Russian Moscow as a member

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,860
and I heard that home so the
professionals

3
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,519
n Russian Moscow they go and they get
all like a full bottle

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,630
or art camp and virtually no whiskey

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,030
and then they take a glass they

6
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,240
each empty glass an even though their
professional

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,280
the still sometimes feel like vomiting

8
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:31,360
so the triggers drink a full glass of
vodka

9
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,980
and sniff your own pets and then

10
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,999
all apparently this somehow overload
your

11
00:00:39,999 --> 00:00:46,039
sensor system and you when hand rule
soon find out if this works there's a

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:46,969
bucket here

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:50,409
it fails so

14
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:54,079
I'm gonna I just only know the solely be
so I'm gonna do moreover

15
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,159
so in

16
00:00:57,159 --> 00:01:00,789
you can do aliases for commands an OLE
DB

17
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:04,019
for example the top one xx and then

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:07,650
I can give in LGB and the arguments this
I can say

19
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,730
dollar rx for example and it works

20
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:15,290
but then if you have these commands like
image look up that then takes the user

21
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:19,040
bash arguments ban actually than

22
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,970
if you try to make him yes doesn't work
for some reason

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,980
so you can do a regex

24
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:31,400
in your LD be a net instead and then
I'll battle

25
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:35,940
work around it but then are so all in
LBB

26
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,190
are rips

27
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,330
you can on so if I do help

28
00:01:43,330 --> 00:01:46,620
xx then it says that it's an
abbreviation for this

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,760
but if I do on if I do help

30
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:55,730
are I L than it doesn't know what it is

31
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,920
or help I away so

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,490
these are just lost in you can actually
redefining

33
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,760
adequate only be and our so on

34
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,760
so moving on so I have here

35
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:17,689
flash running and then our

36
00:02:17,689 --> 00:02:21,340
I have a break point and then

37
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:26,079
so usually have been working with our
browsers that are certain to open source

38
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,950
or Microsoft give you the same ol

39
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:32,189
but then I heard that group an has found
this thing called flash

40
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:35,870
and I thought I should get into and I

41
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:38,870
star flash and I come my stack trace

42
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:43,290
and it's like this and I'm like what the
fuck is this it just numbers

43
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:48,450
and our I don't know if

44
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:52,280
F I haven't and later reversing computer
thing

45
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,489
before so I don't know if my

46
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:58,529
things novel that I chose to

47
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:01,629
how I fixed this problem arm

48
00:03:01,629 --> 00:03:05,689
and I listen to some park where they fix
this problem

49
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:09,920
with Windows but I didn't have windows
so are

50
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,139
I realize that our so here

51
00:03:14,139 --> 00:03:17,870
is my flash file and so when I call

52
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:22,870
map that a turn instead of doing the
sensible thing

53
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,819
and implementing over math functions
themselves

54
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:31,469
Adobe unfortunately chose to you
delegate the math functions to though

55
00:03:31,469 --> 00:03:34,790
to the system library

56
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:38,230
so now I can put our break point on it
an

57
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:42,499
to which I will be done mile redirect
for show

58
00:03:42,499 --> 00:03:46,790
and then our when here I'm running my
flash

59
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,290
which is this so first I R

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:53,559
call it an front brakes then I

61
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:57,700
do something richer I'm not doing to
call a parent again

62
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:02,120
and whatever it executed between those
to cause to a tan

63
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:07,510
to as probably do something so then I
can just replace the numbers with

64
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,540
do something here and then I can keep
running this for

65
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:15,299
different values are do something and
I'll

66
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:19,259
then I know which part up to numbers
belongs to you

67
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:24,599
every do something and so

68
00:04:24,599 --> 00:04:28,610
in to figure out where goes between
though

69
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:32,120
eight and I could just step here

70
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,199
and wait for it to come back to a town
but then

71
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,270
probably this is like super slow because
it's not even out a return your

72
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:43,430
it just keeps going a tenant an intern
intern intern

73
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,879
so are I figured I'd are

74
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:50,729
just skipper had a little until like the
next branch

75
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:54,259
and our go through every branch

76
00:04:54,259 --> 00:04:57,860
and an arm skip in

77
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:04,860
break their in look with the next branch
in

78
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:12,810
ok

79
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,110
alright in so then I did the

80
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:26,460
only sensible thing which is look at the
LDB source code

81
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:30,539
and then threat plan step range the CPP

82
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,500
they implement this functionality that i
won it they do

83
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,669
for instructions get next and axe

84
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,889
architects up next branch instruction

85
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,270
and then F that exists

86
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,740
it's not do it max which is like a bang

87
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:53,819
computer re then he said the break point
at the next branch instruction

88
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:58,039
and an arm you arm

89
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:01,259
otherwise you just said it at the last
one so you're asking for

90
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:05,599
that index on express attraction and
then if we go to the

91
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:11,120
ribs if you go to the implementation

92
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,509
ban roadster sizeof I'm instructions
whatever that is

93
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,530
its like 10 so ask for but next
construction season their branches are

94
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:19,970
not

95
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:23,949
and then it goes there not go out there
to get those so I can just use this

96
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,560
and then but this is actually this
threat plan step Rangers are no

97
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:33,409
are rancher I mean it and it's important
LBB that this

98
00:06:33,409 --> 00:06:37,370
call it bad as it never actually
accessed so

99
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:41,090
they implemented this prep you can use
it for anything so

100
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,159
it was unfortunate so than added

101
00:06:44,159 --> 00:06:49,520
the obvious next step which is

102
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,629
I implement that same algorithm copied
from the city to you

103
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:57,889
c plus plus file in Python and harris et
tres

104
00:06:57,889 --> 00:07:01,090
and I'm severity get PC

105
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:05,090
desire explains that it was hard to get
the program counter

106
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:09,849
and our when I get current road and I
just realized I was looking at Prestbury

107
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:13,020
employment at this and the opposite way
as

108
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:16,500
yesterday so this is actually I

109
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,939
I a first I got PC by regex being

110
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:25,789
from rere now I get all the Preds and
then I see friends euro

111
00:07:25,789 --> 00:07:30,180
but they're instruction pointer is and
efforts the value of PCA but I know

112
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,139
that I know the parade so now even if
none at the Preds are stopped according

113
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:36,689
to levy I can still find

114
00:07:36,689 --> 00:07:41,949
and I'm on and I'll

115
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:48,289
than I have we're debugging and an arm

116
00:07:48,289 --> 00:07:51,919
gonna go here and then I see if

117
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,710
address classes mad 0 with the necessary
actors classes back to

118
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,710
readers something sir to

119
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:13,460
by alright

120
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:25,199
up so then I do something something

121
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:30,729
and then I set a breakpoint and going
back to the other thing

122
00:08:30,729 --> 00:08:34,219
I call something

123
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:41,219
an than I'm open for questions

124
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:48,550
apparently if I take 24 shots IQ the
whole hour

125
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:49,019
thank you
