1
00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:03,899
DC's about and but doing a CPU actually
in

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,420
not of you more or Mike recall at day

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,640
logic up inside as you you in

4
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:13,700
is a is it's an CDs

5
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,710
assemble a tutorial on the whole you
will go back during a CPU

6
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,460
and bus with what it is cold pizza

7
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,739
me from Sonic Unleashed its name
technology of the process technology of

8
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:26,630
Madras abuse

9
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:30,739
you go lorton 3 in 2009 a meter

10
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:34,890
about the person I meet you start
calling deep submicron

11
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,000
and technology solid start

12
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,179
an area

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,890
well they gonna I fears were gonna do I
leave a review of

14
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,699
of of a story of our back doors

15
00:00:48,699 --> 00:00:52,260
and of course icon I cannot talk about
all of them but

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,309
I pick up a some samples about

17
00:00:55,309 --> 00:00:59,109
bay from and families cover

18
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:04,510
however back doors and a truly sorry but
then we gonna ask because about our

19
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,030
jew back doorstep is one is about
culture or

20
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:11,480
he say it's about about I love you too
get

21
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:15,280
a called inside you sleep you and the
other one is how do you get

22
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,300
gotta a I'll tell you sip you basically
should best be frustration on

23
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:22,540
exhortation an eight-day

24
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,210
infiltration the spacing out logic back
going to tip you and the expectation is

25
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,320
basically doing and our MPs are a raft
backpack

26
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,340
and we can either I

27
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:37,570
I love the mostest hope everything works

28
00:01:37,570 --> 00:01:40,930
so an is diffused

29
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,490
and and the priest I will not talk about

30
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:47,760
a different kind of back those pick up

31
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,640
a lot of let your cell into an Apple
patent system

32
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,700
and regard to recuse going cover mall or
use among

33
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:59,250
or or maybe I purpose or and

34
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,500
that ass actually that they are the most
common kind the rookies you have

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,660
begun bishopric enough room where r you
can't play to regain the Meeker Co

36
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,789
Terry and never saw one but respectable

37
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:15,190
you very cool in summer Bhutan that I
never so

38
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,660
anyone you can actually a.m.

39
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,610
do I we can enough protocols like to add
their

40
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:25,820
random number generator there is a very
but effective

41
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:30,490
kinda route keep and repeat some the
back door mated to detect

42
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,480
unfortunately and and

43
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,910
very practical it back doors to work all
the time

44
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:41,740
that's right they are most common but
the Burmese it's very easy to the

45
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,280
Technion

46
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:46,180
and suffer the fans are are getting
better and better and catching of its

47
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,140
kinda back also

48
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:50,400
back during us moving inside a

49
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,770
the car is like dockery like a lowering
the level 2

50
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:59,260
to their to the car were a 56 that so

51
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,390
a I'll talk we we very close

52
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,160
to the fee 6 very close and like at the
lowest level

53
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:10,650
am where we gonna see this actually

54
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,360
you looks really look like a software
because a

55
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,050
in our community thing you have
software-defined basically to war

56
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:21,270
did olden the last year's

57
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,110
I think it's a really practical route
keep

58
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:28,120
read it because he's buddy Spain see
very difficult to do

59
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,300
and ang and

60
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,440
it's not practical like a likes of a
rocket but

61
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,830
do have parties if they have a lot of
help and this pain in her work

62
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:43,930
and on well established we talk about it
there

63
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,340
they all this one don't just want to cry
fact this is a very good fruity

64
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:50,700
backed up sorry and is is worse

65
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,020
placed in the greats you beast like I a
picture I was like I wouldn a picture of

66
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,590
the day

67
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,590
US eager there wasn't a moscow embassy
and you

68
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,950
he's actually was not like a microphone
that

69
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,480
a didn't have any power he got activated
bikes on our

70
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,620
if requested you gotta human in a in our

71
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:15,340
with our with our ready for quincy I
we'll meet

72
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:18,620
we'd mother late and I'm using a
different frequency so it was very

73
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,699
difficult to find

74
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:22,919
and with the signing actually buy
unitary mean

75
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,139
is whether ocean and CNT few that
created a lot of

76
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:30,289
of J television on create it to me
neuroscience

77
00:04:30,289 --> 00:04:35,439
a musical instrument an USB corey was
treated in

78
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:40,210
that the twenties and thirties very own
technology and

79
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,599
but this is a very very families
backdoor

80
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:47,259
you went straight to the name in the
90's by the NCAA

81
00:04:47,259 --> 00:04:51,669
the idea past you every communication
there I took up these

82
00:04:51,669 --> 00:04:55,479
decent christian because our a key
scroll make and used his crew meeting

83
00:04:55,479 --> 00:04:55,979
type:

84
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:00,169
basically the NCAA of the comment
government of the main key

85
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,120
massacre you can listen to a
Communication buddy US about that

86
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:05,099
actually a

87
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:08,390
not only have accused iraqis crew

88
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:11,940
is completely the is

89
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:15,060
doctor for real issue but as a couple I
will happily T

90
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:19,780
a that the front nothing to do with the
keys girl because I i will never get the

91
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,270
Interior under proper console

92
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,600
the year nobody adopted these cheap Russ
Berrie situate act

93
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,050
day that the back door and these are

94
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:35,020
a very modern day back to us or implants
vaccine CA costumes

95
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,400
and he was lead by either snow than it

96
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:41,460
you must be happy lot of krakauer
devices the country

97
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:45,350
complaint you enjoy watching and you my
jeans a company and

98
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,880
back to arson inside k boobs

99
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,940
do form a kind of a sister tempest

100
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:55,810
attack twenty they the me3 frequencies
you can control a motherly

101
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:00,150
they have a lot of of different a back
towards the panel it

102
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,140
i Jan from in CA can order from

103
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,150
free are too thousand dollars

104
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:11,180
each one be interesting technology

105
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,410
is not renew thesis at least farm

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,500
East are from five years ago also you
can imagine

107
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,280
you what they have today and

108
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:24,530
we are somehow I for a back but hurry

109
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:29,340
rei explore if you can make a mean yet
they have were conference about

110
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,360
a how do I pay rootkits because you

111
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,790
most in they want I know its cost they
have a chance to say

112
00:06:37,790 --> 00:06:41,310
this and universities around every year
on a chance to endure you

113
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:44,690
who you they from two teams while one
after a pack

114
00:06:44,690 --> 00:06:49,050
or insert Carruth keep it the other one
have to defend them detective

115
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:52,240
so interesting they the been a

116
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,330
three or four years in this a look at
the sign to

117
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,550
coming up on these front the say am

118
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:03,470
for the challenge on and then did you
have a

119
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:07,020
some account beria came to rate their
article attacks like this one is very

120
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,990
famous man

121
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:11,400
the guy basically modified day I gate

122
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:14,480
transistor that the on top of my system
so it

123
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,330
insert I will never leave the in a in a
run the generator is

124
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:22,770
on simple switch you see and but

125
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,030
a we going to do a different thing we're
going to have more

126
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:29,320
simple basic route it we can I insert a
big piece

127
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,720
of logico inside a Cebu and

128
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,060
well-to-do then you probably know a went
fishing like this I like cheese

129
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,070
like to call they when you develop a
seat on your wrist leave

130
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:45,140
a lot of interface like Jake are a

131
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:48,180
bend or specific goals

132
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,540
that helps and development and not at
the time

133
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:55,590
you and deferment forget them they are
there

134
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:58,690
I'm so you can use to use this

135
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:02,880
is very difficult just do to CVS

136
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,390
a fast sign pensioner like that ok was
not intentional of the time

137
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,100
it's not intentional but it really acts
I make a back door

138
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:13,220
and behind a pic sampras cue

139
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:16,669
honest like about what

140
00:08:16,669 --> 00:08:20,300
what we did so way we basically

141
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,530
a.m. want you to do a bag or would like
a

142
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,700
he said apiece of cold in maxi seems
Cebu

143
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,410
not a very small modification but back
to be

144
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,830
be brute modification to see how the
police to

145
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:39,719
to shoe addict because I G I can find
any any

146
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:44,500
example of why I Aria route keep a real
about going out via Cebu

147
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:48,860
it hey dozen rate difficult to do
because you're gone

148
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:52,600
usually don't have the cold of our for
Cebu he cites a very

149
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:56,300
somebody in and is like a

150
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:00,530
the crown jewels of of the of in Pelham
REM you BC you

151
00:09:00,530 --> 00:09:03,760
you can see that this of course if you
so

152
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,830
use baby from to find out back before
one and

153
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:11,830
because I we with only two days to
rootkits

154
00:09:11,830 --> 00:09:15,410
semi-pro through to you is it basically
is our

155
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:18,540
you you can't you free trade growth or
inside

156
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:21,839
I Cebu on with the reef air you can

157
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,350
X with rate data from inside Cebu gonna
do them

158
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:31,579
vision about a.m. my room assimilation
from them out proxy because

159
00:09:31,579 --> 00:09:34,690
a I Ivan how a million dollars through

160
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,970
to file eat that gonna show you

161
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:42,600
a the signs and a complete process whole
code looks like

162
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,040
and they're on their way for Queen
Sirikit a

163
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:49,620
a bag right which I love that the most
racially knife g8 I have here

164
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,490
I hope it works these is very

165
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:57,089
but if you ve got away frequencies you
can trust it at

166
00:09:57,089 --> 00:10:02,550
this Missy maybe Body Works okay so
diffuse want the peace pact or

167
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,140
it's very simple you can see here is
basically a piece a logic

168
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,440
get since in between the CPU and the bus

169
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,550
and he is consent listening to their bus
rafik

170
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:20,150
and when the looks McKay time hook your
%ah specific bus were Pacific a

171
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:23,650
heat at passed through the basket
activated on

172
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:29,100
is left you do basically two teams right
into memory and Red Ribbon Week

173
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,280
we without you you have basically other
bargain

174
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,339
so you can a select a covert

175
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,700
divider you can place called on recall
from memory

176
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,270
on with every kinda called you do you
like into memory is

177
00:10:42,270 --> 00:10:45,820
isolates the CPU for a ku klux so the
Cebu never

178
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,890
know what route but happen and

179
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:52,209
and end-use response or back to the Cebu
on

180
00:10:52,209 --> 00:10:55,740
but the members change and

181
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,990
for the Sabre you sorry I'll a CPU use
in our %um

182
00:10:59,990 --> 00:11:03,170
a cortex is one of the smallest

183
00:11:03,170 --> 00:11:06,860
at the sign for our %um bertice it's a
real one in the sexually

184
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:10,250
you should a term million southeast are
%um

185
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:13,440
in every plate and the baskets they

186
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,459
amber buses is called a signed by the
buses the most use in their

187
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,890
in the industry and

188
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:25,410
the good thing is a he actually working
yep with us or you can and see the tyson

189
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:25,940
now

190
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,910
not mind me enough forty finally meet
their process or OC's

191
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:33,579
83 I think one show you

192
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:36,850
am is the high level design

193
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:39,860
its base a very simple statement seems
very small

194
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:44,079
a is avail in your YouTube for you the
common tree the Alerus

195
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,350
that a and execute and then you seek ok
where you are Corp

196
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:52,500
I put the stuff on the bus well you can
you can do a lot of

197
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,370
of of you can place to start than there
was in a lot of different way for

198
00:11:56,370 --> 00:11:58,540
example you can send up into the machine

199
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,030
in in somewhere in the machine will

200
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:05,839
in in some way we be copied the packet
into memory when the cop at the party

201
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,530
the back into memory

202
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:10,570
inside the pocket the it is common he's
a

203
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:13,720
discography in like you know

204
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:17,079
use in in seven awards

205
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:23,050
and the rookie season in duties its bass
traffic and get activated

206
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:27,270
and this is a sorry state machine is
writing very low

207
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:31,940
bayliss languish and when do it with in
cover the speech and language

208
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,410
that you basically used to to define
they

209
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:39,110
logic gates by Cebu trem

210
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:43,070
si pueden a source code are now we have
peace peace but he looks ought to back

211
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,230
to results so

212
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:48,040
writing in very low am

213
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,020
we can see he they are the cookies the
estate magic number to have to pass

214
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,050
through the bus

215
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:56,670
to activate a the back door BlackBerrys
basically a

216
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,600
I'm a bus operation is very simple

217
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:03,680
an choose but got on the bus right that
the

218
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:08,740
or or or extract about the front it from
the bus

219
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:13,800
and on Hughes echoing looks when we
sympathize

220
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,770
UTI I think this is an I'm

221
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,980
for the final meters have been this is
the logic is certainly reason of PC card

222
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,459
is the

223
00:13:22,459 --> 00:13:26,579
is called you when you compile a tough
call resorts in about

224
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,240
fall ru under a gates and

225
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,560
you can see I needed orange points here
they are the gates and Greene

226
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,910
blind as the connections I

227
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:42,220
we see you say Cooper process there are
free you can go out

228
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,610
at the libraries for free and but he or
she can see

229
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:48,750
when under and one

230
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:52,309
189 a meter is a biotechnology like

231
00:13:52,309 --> 00:13:55,809
and your soul but is the one but you can
get for free

232
00:13:55,809 --> 00:13:58,870
and another one for a final meters

233
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:02,610
that is a little more more and more you
know

234
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:07,160
on you but way the back seat least you

235
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:10,730
Mischer there at the resources that
distribute takes

236
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:14,130
with tobacco and weed out the back door

237
00:14:14,130 --> 00:14:17,930
you can see these you stick cortex is
very small sip use only the

238
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,300
about a

239
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:22,330
in 9,000 seats you know they up are

240
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:26,720
core i7 house like millions of cells HCl
South about

241
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,149
mmm for fighter and sister in sight and
the back door is

242
00:14:31,149 --> 00:14:35,810
right be compared to the Cebu UC is it
the one is the back to your house about

243
00:14:35,810 --> 00:14:36,660
10 percent

244
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:41,390
the resources because it back but it's
really not up then I said

245
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:45,930
so ice you is actually quite be compared
to Cebu is very tissue to detect

246
00:14:45,930 --> 00:14:50,870
anti-serb picture of this review we
don't allow you submit a help

247
00:14:50,870 --> 00:14:54,000
it I think this is a 6 near you yes

248
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,560
the 189 meters a

249
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,160
you have the gates it's the people a
year up up I and then you have six

250
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,220
metal ions to the interconnections is
very soon after a PCB

251
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:09,760
effect the Irish at the same to about
PCB mapping

252
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:14,440
on and what we gonna hurt you

253
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:17,829
throughout the day rocked or so you can

254
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,100
we're basically do I def with its if you
call that you can

255
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:26,180
about what you want to analyze it and he
works as simulated in a three-year

256
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:31,610
he works in in now in if you want to use
are completely custom I seek

257
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:35,209
so um but

258
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:38,720
of course you need a I license for REM
for choosing to take these

259
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,180
is very expensive bat if you're a
college you can get it for free

260
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:45,440
your college you actually can
manufacture for free parolee

261
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,410
must call this our for a arrangement
with the air with the FOB value gun

262
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:56,230
not municipal you can do my hundreds of
Cebu Sol Campbell Soup for free though

263
00:15:56,230 --> 00:15:57,140
we do it for you

264
00:15:57,140 --> 00:16:00,399
rodeo into I would try to do that

265
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:03,620
so I gonna do demonstration code looks
like

266
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:07,350
or always koi cease to detect bacteria

267
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:11,579
it they km prospectus the basically the
priest

268
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:15,190
one that I talk to you that I think the
any any

269
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:19,100
if guidance ways and u14 try to hide it

270
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:23,220
anyway so he's quite should you see with
us mister to see it

271
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:30,220
I'm its be

272
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:39,900
be gates or it is our 3.0 meters

273
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:43,530
cheap for 10 years because when you
increased a

274
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:46,910
decreased it this size of the the
process you can also increase in

275
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,040
Montpelier says you have

276
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,880
about the layoffs you can see from here
you can see the back door East

277
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,900
that are from is went piece of this
seems to be your diet is different use

278
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,940
other one because

279
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:02,330
a the weighted squats died as you do

280
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:06,430
a getting the tyson in a different way
so you only by looking at you can see

281
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,570
that the some code that is different and
the author

282
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:15,570
miss you more closely be

283
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:21,300
who and you it's been all day

284
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:27,270
use my like a video game you

285
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,830
you can see here that the friendliest

286
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:34,320
William bosley above the gates they want
to repeal

287
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,020
down below and we can see that

288
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,020
the backdoor cutter us a lot of of more
your sunday a regular

289
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:45,330
REM called because because the city
because they suck

290
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:48,430
R rating bariloche so I i on bright

291
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:53,190
in optimized wat sought their compiler
try to do anything juju

292
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:56,309
to with together my back to base
actually not

293
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:59,360
completely a is not optimized said

294
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,490
so eat actions within about two layers
lot more elect miss you call call with

295
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,020
everyone aryan call these

296
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:08,470
he say we can see if this is the real

297
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:13,150
REM you can see co-op team activity you
really does need anymore rain years new

298
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,340
34 only and you only works but their
back door

299
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,740
really means a lot but that's it but
only because are not the fact because I

300
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:22,490
basically

301
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:27,090
even mind even spend a lot of time do
not deny said I use it a lot of

302
00:18:27,090 --> 00:18:27,850
registers

303
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,360
that the that's what he saw be good you
when you call the No

304
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,500
in a in a a sick you cut you to minimize
the amount of memory per usual use a lot

305
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:41,190
because I basically a I'm and software
guy so I don't know how to go for her

306
00:18:41,190 --> 00:18:41,620
work

307
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:47,090
but the computer actually a you do it
try to put it on

308
00:18:47,090 --> 00:18:50,480
but the first within a lot already yours
you can see

309
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,520
use the report be solicitation see

310
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:57,710
here the gates

311
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:01,140
absolutely can see there's the

312
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,350
this mortgage is a forty finally to
gates on

313
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,920
is the connections you can see the the

314
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:12,720
internal compass and that is the
smartest Cebu for example

315
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,980
began CN the one the 110-meter Cebu

316
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:22,090
East much more difficult to you seen

317
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,320
it is only have six years so the
compiler

318
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,450
coolant a with more layoffs and they
were back doing decent these processes

319
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,660
are missing possible to see

320
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:38,660
this show you I'm I don't know if you
can see anything but I can see

321
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,770
absolutely

322
00:19:42,770 --> 00:19:47,250
anything at all what is universally
needs some kinda suffer like I therefore

323
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,780
for a6 for peace because it's impossible
to see buddy that really depends on how

324
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:52,970
lot of factors

325
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,390
facilitate the process or if you can see
more that more

326
00:19:57,390 --> 00:20:01,400
grossly we can see that the gates I much
more farther away

327
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,929
because you because the help most fewer
mayors

328
00:20:04,929 --> 00:20:08,910
he have to respect it advances the
country much farther away so this is

329
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:09,480
really a

330
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,880
a not very not something I selected like
the peace process

331
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:17,090
okay

332
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,660
so this was the Cisco by peacefully
looking at the ad

333
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:25,040
on and I said you can see a that I'm
with the cation is

334
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,560
right BC to see of course I didn't go
out the back door

335
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,300
in st. the way so or only because you
called earlier most

336
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:36,100
any in you call their

337
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,350
am with a little less do you think mind
you used

338
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:42,770
can make it much more difficult to
choose a tech but this is the first

339
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,419
right

340
00:20:43,419 --> 00:20:48,040
and defied that we are looking at it
said yes

341
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,820
3 5 it is this I I find that you
basically you send to the far but you

342
00:20:52,820 --> 00:20:56,350
to getting manufacture of course these
cheap he's missing a lot

343
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,810
of of verifications a lot of steps

344
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,540
and you really need to make it from to
make you for manufacture for example

345
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:08,310
I don't have any power power connection
I don't have any time you're allowed to

346
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:09,220
use just the diet

347
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,929
so but the soft just for for showing
hopefully looks like

348
00:21:12,929 --> 00:21:16,340
am so

349
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,270
this is there for my of the the worker
have to bust through the bus

350
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:23,580
sorry con Bacup by the backdoor

351
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,240
execute goal is have you can see is
bracing bridges are common Israel right

352
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,860
to someone

353
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,860
single and a bit common and other is

354
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:37,090
and not a and then a a final comment is
mean execution when you execute

355
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:40,160
they backdoor disconnect the CPU because
the

356
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:44,410
because a the Back Bay day

357
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:48,030
the back the peace in place between the
bass and the Cebu slate disconnected

358
00:21:48,030 --> 00:21:49,260
execute the comment on

359
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,679
just activity secure against CPU never
know

360
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,679
what happen so it is an example we can

361
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:02,230
echo we come activated backed out do
some in kobe you can see disco

362
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,560
doesn't have anybody I mean it is just a
simple mem copy

363
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,120
but a this wearing a

364
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,990
get their stories hold back but they the
back door is activated this is a common

365
00:22:12,990 --> 00:22:13,690
cold

366
00:22:13,690 --> 00:22:17,150
she in the sprites just by coping these
stream

367
00:22:17,150 --> 00:22:22,080
into a buffer I force these that the
past through the bus

368
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:27,730
and and his get effected by the back
door and backed in get activated

369
00:22:27,730 --> 00:22:31,510
a of course we can to abandon copy but
not so do you buy

370
00:22:31,510 --> 00:22:34,659
anyway you can put place the bus this a

371
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:38,240
thousands of wat u to

372
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:44,610
to put up in the past is run a
simulation to see whole corps this works

373
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:48,390
the you can assimilate

374
00:22:48,390 --> 00:22:52,830
any they were Cebu good I'm lead without

375
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,240
we dunno a with I'm waitress open source
a county car is very low

376
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,950
because they are on call the so simple
is very fast your own

377
00:23:01,950 --> 00:23:06,169
you the you governor in real time it is
very very fast you know how to wait

378
00:23:06,169 --> 00:23:10,880
a lot juicy the assaults we are using of
course an operating system

379
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,490
and I fewer with everything about the
system

380
00:23:14,490 --> 00:23:18,760
Nicole cheap yours is because is about
this review is very small we got me how

381
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:19,630
to use our

382
00:23:19,630 --> 00:23:23,900
right now but the system so is working

383
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:27,860
on we can see because the Kaka per
second to boot

384
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:31,669
and there was a few and were later on

385
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:34,940
here we got they fees one

386
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:38,090
is in a war and then you do them in kobe

387
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:41,460
and the second one we can see that the
back to raise money for it

388
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:44,710
the diffuse hello what they were back

389
00:23:44,710 --> 00:23:49,320
and UBC the softball you can see that
there is no way to use these

390
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:53,210
this can happen cost it's just a min
could be true about for

391
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:56,880
this in enough anything that modify to
stream but the bag was just got

392
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,970
activated

393
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:00,700
my fight this thing actually sorry
suffering only three and you can my

394
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,830
faith in you wait

395
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:06,070
but a.m. you got modified

396
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:09,330
and these are assimilation from

397
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,580
is very fast from from very low

398
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,640
so a you can see tho call money

399
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,240
a proxy actually they competed like no
10 million clocks

400
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,560
simulating silvery fascination

401
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,790
I'm were discontinuing

402
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:32,300
that this was a back door so this is a
way to you place a biker and you can

403
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:35,710
get that inside the CPU is of course not
the only way to

404
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:39,540
know if not thousands way whether a
Passion Pit

405
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:44,090
I want to chew chew to do want that dick
actually works or how it looks like

406
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:47,570
physically when you look basically at
the cheap

407
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:52,080
and course during for that you knew this
of course the CPU

408
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,700
and so you so you can send it I sip the
south coast is

409
00:24:55,700 --> 00:25:00,070
cover a Palace 80s be difficult to get

410
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:03,130
bout a

411
00:25:03,130 --> 00:25:08,980
against you actually got it this is a
soccer fan REM sleep you can see

412
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,260
is barely see the you get the only
contrast

413
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,980
p.m. and that we give to you for free if
your coalition of course

414
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:20,780
about become a friend polish we spin

415
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:24,830
that basically Boro boss take the call

416
00:25:24,830 --> 00:25:29,000
and a week NCTC say

417
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,360
the route you can he teases back to you
be at

418
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,320
up with a little too on the condition on
it so you can you can

419
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:39,530
you can't see it on the stand it very
small it's a

420
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,900
it's just a matching you know is a case
because the much you can actually

421
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:48,020
a well at the prince is going to back
the room you can see how are you what's

422
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:51,060
speak will so

423
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:54,060
the next one is once you are inside call
you you take

424
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,560
that out well basically you can do it be
a

425
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,040
by with the network but what if you are

426
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:04,919
don't I like to the network you and i
got up or something like this:

427
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:08,360
well you can use the old NCAA treat that
tempest

428
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,740
and you you gonna meet the beats use in

429
00:26:11,740 --> 00:26:15,240
no such an issue can you miss sound be
right shown

430
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,669
rather we choose and radio frequency to
restate use use to

431
00:26:19,669 --> 00:26:22,760
to use and desist

432
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,790
this demonstration is a particularly for
fun one because

433
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:30,470
are you still it there let's %um israeli
frequency

434
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:34,159
because it basically what we did but we
we do is

435
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:37,580
on Sui once we have a button inside with
juice

436
00:26:37,580 --> 00:26:41,600
speech on and off the let's 100
courtesies

437
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,760
a lot of off-speed the let's can switch
on I'm

438
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:48,280
accounts for just one company apparently
just dawn on

439
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:51,590
but a do a lot of of

440
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:55,740
or different emission we'll review we'll
with it the more we meet over the body

441
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,740
frequency

442
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:01,880
from the PCB trace it up a PCB out like
it's more and dance

443
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,970
so you can ac3 got it this way the
course not new

444
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:10,210
but this very funny to see you working
you working on that on Manhattan

445
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:13,280
on now unlucky few or bore

446
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,600
this is a porta are using the cell
safety year it is not money feat doesn't

447
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,630
have any kind of want a nap

448
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,860
or any modification we can see how we
can meet

449
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,940
the by the frequency in basically

450
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:31,500
and in in a lot of of of different
frequencies

451
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,740
am we gonna pick it up Wheaton these

452
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:40,010
this is a small software review speech
she won

453
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:45,350
a about 20 or Ceasar uses a TV receiver
actually pet you can try keeping in

454
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:46,130
combating

455
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:50,080
in a suffer review it's only a receiver
but the Sony thought that the only thing

456
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,360
that we need the size or issue

457
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:57,960
because they need to restate day is the
ball

458
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,760
36-hole we were basically when you
switch on and off

459
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,790
I PCB about

460
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:08,210
over 100 workers and

461
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:12,520
just in a square wave bit it's gone away
actually is composed of green

462
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,659
of a lot of harmonics out since I'm
waves

463
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:18,760
a this is basically for your Terry

464
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,100
so you send the signal got you what are
you doing is sending

465
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:26,580
a lot of different frequencies and we
only had to pick one

466
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:30,380
where they were 250 Armani tier 1
whatever we want

467
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,560
on this in the art listen 90s and this
pregnancy and we went on our

468
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:39,490
gonna listen we're gonna meet that the
horse who threaten any kind about the

469
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,620
you simply frequency

470
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:44,840
the ranch's pretty good because accounts
are you pay right

471
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:49,030
later to the hopes of me to some works
perfectly

472
00:28:49,030 --> 00:28:53,780
and at the their properties you can use
any fancy modulation you covered you

473
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,600
but he did tomb of unknown and you do
some kind of

474
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,040
amplitude modulations it's very simple
maybe you can do face population without

475
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:06,389
more its Arctic kind of and calling pat

476
00:29:06,389 --> 00:29:10,409
Dysport so gonna show you this way

477
00:29:10,409 --> 00:29:14,470
and we can see Co it that the more a

478
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:17,960
them or high frequencies they them or

479
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,659
signing a lease get lower lower lower
but there is no problem because

480
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:26,159
a we if we meet the 100 be accursed

481
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:29,260
and we use a frequency and at some
income from interest

482
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:33,990
the activities very securely sin because
in not why the Sleepys and ace

483
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:37,679
issues into some come from a curse
pregnancy so

484
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,169
it's basically a I avoid began began
berry

485
00:29:41,169 --> 00:29:44,240
very sleepy Cup the signal out the 709

486
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:47,940
company offers even uses much

487
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:51,350
less the power there

488
00:29:51,350 --> 00:29:54,450
and because we can run a simulation

489
00:29:54,450 --> 00:29:58,380
of the PCB call with the if you're East

490
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:03,030
a great look at it and when the
frequency few the power few

491
00:30:03,030 --> 00:30:06,169
you can see something very peculiar keys
to be use are

492
00:30:06,169 --> 00:30:09,540
but you we don't use a single PCB but
yet you use

493
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,909
for by Richard your use 8 because we
have 8

494
00:30:12,909 --> 00:30:17,630
LED's so a if you'd be sexually
detective

495
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:21,800
because in it looks like a yankee and
United baggage I E

496
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:25,870
it's some kind of Jackie formation every
not exploring our invite because you're

497
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,429
just run the simulation

498
00:30:27,429 --> 00:30:30,520
using out buy an upper souls a.m.

499
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,899
and by its emissions come may collect
when the cold

500
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:37,530
you come don't know either program and
use it

501
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:42,880
record on keys keys call you define and
then up to use that the five

502
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,980
8 PCB's the finer and

503
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,010
very simple you know you I see you
called The Pines

504
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:52,179
on and the they produced as you choose
you

505
00:30:52,179 --> 00:30:56,100
set up the frequency and the growing
weed show you the few

506
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:02,000
and lessees works call it looks like
because very cool it can you can use it

507
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,040
any for a lot of things not only for for
them but those

508
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:12,119
scene

509
00:31:12,119 --> 00:31:14,619
alright so curious day

510
00:31:14,619 --> 00:31:18,730
a like out through the representation of
their PCB's because much more complex

511
00:31:18,730 --> 00:31:20,279
and pieces like to the PCB

512
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:24,730
is not straight lines is more I you know
is interested in some kind of orbit

513
00:31:24,730 --> 00:31:28,440
at just then have the time so I'd be
there a

514
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,730
a simplification of the of the the lines

515
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:35,629
of the PCB or solid see the radiation
pattern

516
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:38,909
we can see here whole a

517
00:31:38,909 --> 00:31:43,590
132 the revision button is quite the
election out you can see that

518
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:46,850
is very it's in one single dimension

519
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:49,970
because a because the other one

520
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:53,340
a PC release at the side actors I J
antenna

521
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:57,009
we can see how that the election
actually change when we change the

522
00:31:57,009 --> 00:32:00,749
frequency because we are not too sweet
and i 100 me after we are doing at 700

523
00:32:00,749 --> 00:32:01,809
so

524
00:32:01,809 --> 00:32:05,399
let's play this is a very good animation
because you could change

525
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,690
you can see that %uh about okay with
just

526
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:12,369
31 when the 17 and there is too much

527
00:32:12,369 --> 00:32:15,509
but if we it when we increase the
frequency

528
00:32:15,509 --> 00:32:19,809
at the 1998 even more direction and on
the Seine more

529
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:23,470
over to a singles a single direction so
we can

530
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:27,279
missing the point alright in a Anne

531
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:31,419
for a boy not protection whatever an

532
00:32:31,419 --> 00:32:34,809
I'm it is a very cool program

533
00:32:34,809 --> 00:32:38,429
okay let's take it because and

534
00:32:38,429 --> 00:32:42,779
I probably I miss a lot of of perfect
for example I I didn't

535
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:46,059
simulate that drone plane but we modify
somewhat

536
00:32:46,059 --> 00:32:50,440
this simulation but his from from just
an idea of of the few

537
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:54,220
over 120 points possibly and but

538
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:59,379
actually around I really miss you meant
so I see your age was released a few

539
00:32:59,379 --> 00:33:02,470
Houston steez these two shaped sup

540
00:33:02,470 --> 00:33:06,519
but they were put the ball in the mirror
and data measurements are on the table

541
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,739
and the press release these

542
00:33:07,739 --> 00:33:13,019
so it's not the release email about this
approximately the same way we can see

543
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:14,320
that actually point

544
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:17,499
where you have to point and

545
00:33:17,499 --> 00:33:21,600
I really need to to do a lot more
measurements Burton

546
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:25,669
these we can see that these approximated
the shape east direction on

547
00:33:25,669 --> 00:33:29,399
that's the ball where and the at the
angle basically day

548
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:33,200
then denies in the middle on and I miss
from into power

549
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,330
a out different points in circle

550
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,539
so there that you really looks looks
like simulation system

551
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:44,859
simulation is protectorate and anti
something died in

552
00:33:44,859 --> 00:33:48,720
trite but is very very interesting
because by

553
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,720
using different PCB lines

554
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:55,490
we actually can point the
electromagnetic field

555
00:33:55,490 --> 00:33:59,429
you wrote I'm and is a simulation

556
00:33:59,429 --> 00:34:04,730
of their HP series but airplane polar to
just meet at the feast the lead want to

557
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,529
let you

558
00:34:05,529 --> 00:34:08,609
I the S&P the one that Cheechoo for

559
00:34:08,609 --> 00:34:12,589
because you would if you could actually
change the election jury

560
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:15,839
the back door actually can and meet a

561
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:19,760
exit rate and choose to be election
where you can you can exit 3

562
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:24,079
I really didn't write these at them
simulation is quite accurate so

563
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,569
its AP pretty would work been up

564
00:34:27,569 --> 00:34:30,760
can't read it right now the CVS

565
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,799
if you actually work I'm

566
00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:37,540
I cover the see

567
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:41,240
for peace yay for here if you can see

568
00:34:41,240 --> 00:34:45,419
year the CV can see

569
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:52,419
Bay ok with her feet you

570
00:34:54,889 --> 00:34:57,950
you

571
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:00,960
the PGA house are

572
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,109
ATA is be suggesting lation about

573
00:35:04,109 --> 00:35:08,400
X 86 Cebu we can see here restoring on

574
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,599
there you go is putting .us it takes a
little wide

575
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:16,049
so this is running inside the FPGA

576
00:35:16,049 --> 00:35:19,859
is actually a are is notoriously pewter
software Cebu

577
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:24,740
is only 16 beats bertice only choose to
show you that actually be sorry sup

578
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:28,220
such a a working system and I have a
keyword

579
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,779
sorry but the this Bee Gees Barry all
technology software to use a peace to

580
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:33,720
keep were here

581
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:37,020
sorry for pushing key actually you can
see

582
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:40,549
Cup I about what kind of crowd were
related to help

583
00:35:40,549 --> 00:35:44,119
memory controller busy a controller your
controller

584
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:47,230
I think about the cuba controller East
up the

585
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:50,579
the back door is inside a coupon for a
site for with a key

586
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:54,069
actually will it to keep this can call
the fuck you were we get

587
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:58,390
a you guessed it later you see you drive
frequency you can sure you

588
00:35:58,390 --> 00:36:01,809
so your own been

589
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:05,210
risk you go

590
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,250
them welded

591
00:36:08,250 --> 00:36:11,569
netanyahu income for me young

592
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:17,900
each yet please being

593
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:21,180
you by we can see it

594
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:24,809
air because we don't know we don't all
rights so we gonna

595
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:28,450
switch the radio see we come pick it up

596
00:36:28,450 --> 00:36:31,900
my see

597
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:35,760
mmm that go

598
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,630
tricked Mac

599
00:36:41,630 --> 00:36:44,560
the sea strategists awkwardness is very
who

600
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,150
I know she's works perfectly these days

601
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:54,070
deadly frequency spectrum of 700
megahertz I was told you so income from

602
00:36:54,070 --> 00:36:55,280
actors to stay

603
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,950
i think is the fourth in the morning so
we gonna

604
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:03,090
you know the you can see here when the
prosecutor

605
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,760
nick is a keyhole we actually meets a
lot of

606
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:10,690
of radiofrequency it's actually lot you
can it's had a pretty

607
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:14,660
you got through to meet these kind of
power the

608
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:18,340
for example if you you we use another
frequency

609
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,560
you you can see the rest almost no
frequency here because have to be an

610
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,100
armani

611
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,770
for example may come from Africa also
work I'm

612
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:32,800
I we doesn't work very good with $5,500
there you go

613
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:36,850
that differ in the morning square wave
so

614
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:40,820

we we work much better so there you go

640
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:41,859
this is a demonstration to find the most
efficient or you can text it's right

641
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:45,480
a key well thats that's it you have

question anyone

646
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,240
thanks up McLeish nissen

647
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:11,290
directed to the security back door but

648
00:40:11,290 --> 00:40:14,690
artisan wanted the FBD a step too used
I'll what

649
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:18,940
platform do you use to deploy do the
FPGA and

650
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,020
to generate the bitstream how a lot but
not for me to use

651
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:27,610
your YouTube question is air what
actually what it is what platform I use

652
00:40:27,610 --> 00:40:30,650
a it for for their body frequency Ricky

653
00:40:30,650 --> 00:40:34,060
right here bar more so than which what
method did you use to generate the

654
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:34,740
bitstream

655
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:39,590
orders I links or yes isolator is an out
there are 81

656
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:42,620
it front they're sick miss the Boer

657
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:47,240
on and the compiler the squatters it's a
precompiled actually kinda for free

658
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:51,040
is this one a collecting and brought
brother because the west and thereby you

659
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:51,460
need

660
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:55,000
here disease what cost you you can go
for free

661
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,730
and I wanted to know are in

662
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:02,120
in from a security point of view what
vector do you see because

663
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:05,470
essentially you are generating erin is
hardly rate

664
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:09,550
so doing different people who have
access to generating hard there will be

665
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:10,670
two hundred manufacturer

666
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:14,060
so what scenario do you see this
backdoor

667
00:41:14,060 --> 00:41:18,760
actually affecting Cebu's yes there's a
great question you are asking the

668
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,370
this is really what this now your what
it justice Israel

669
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:27,410
application well actually a I was
talking with a a couple guys from

670
00:41:27,410 --> 00:41:32,290
in the land IMed about these and their
are saying that this is impossible we

671
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:33,570
can never get home

672
00:41:33,570 --> 00:41:37,500
and get some cracker a place coincidence
I'll call

673
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,800
that means that of course the Wii
happens a

674
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:44,850
that the East they are really israeli
they have fear actually they form

675
00:41:44,850 --> 00:41:48,940
I so I security and not best friends
both how we're friends

676
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:53,570
it they fear that this from Bay Breeze
more are %um campanis

677
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:57,560
the specific name and rockwell rockwell
Sr

678
00:41:57,560 --> 00:42:01,670
REM manufacturer in China anti 156 Jimmy
Jean

679
00:42:01,670 --> 00:42:04,670
they are like by person chop

680
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,930
so they'd really don't have any security
whatsoever

681
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,380
they are very very bored I would
security so

682
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:15,550
basically because for me to say a car we
he will never happen to us

683
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,510
but REM we there are 1000 opens and
pieces

684
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:23,170
of course makes everything REM if I can
get the call so

685
00:42:23,170 --> 00:42:27,590
anyone else can that is the reason
you're basically a cracker attacking

686
00:42:27,590 --> 00:42:28,230
rockwell

687
00:42:28,230 --> 00:42:32,050
or unworthy an eye on your tour

688
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:35,060
Aria manufacture smile having a month
for two
