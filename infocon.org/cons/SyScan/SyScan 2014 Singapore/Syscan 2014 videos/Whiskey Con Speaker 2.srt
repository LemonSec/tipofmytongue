1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:03,699
so for small thanks for an awesome
suspense my first time

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:07,399
Singapore's first time says can so I i
love that and i wanna

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,080
use a chance have these five minutes to
share with you some data

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,610
and hopefully you guys can use a date on
to something fun with it maybe tell me

5
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,970
what you guessed it because on yeah
their

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:22,400
is lot of nice stuff out and the
Internet and I will yeah

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
you can you can get from me some some
information are some data from the

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:26,480
internet

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
so I wanna start up with something that
is related to sis can

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,380
I want it out like a demo or or
something that would be interesting for

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:33,910
Thomas

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,260
soap that startup on and see

13
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,920
what is ECOnetic JJ dot com I just found
this

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,700
on I i looked at no Sisk and Alaric and

15
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,670
everything that's related to where it's
hosted on the IP entire funders to maim

16
00:00:48,670 --> 00:00:55,210
and so if I can get my superior I does
this work

17
00:00:55,210 --> 00:01:00,379
it to you

18
00:01:00,379 --> 00:01:03,629
so so

19
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,780
so you can see the

20
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:10,670
who is out but for you cannot you
connect a data com so this is going to

21
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,080
Johnson & Johnson

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,720
johnson Johnson asked Thomas what is
this and you said this is

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,380
in a big company if you look at the
website

24
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:22,450
this is like website they do I dunno

25
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:25,670
all kinds a shop stuff products and
whatever so awsome

26
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,340
what is your business relationship with
those guys sobel I don't know I'm

27
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,799
buying some products may be from some of
their subsidiaries or something

28
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,490
so they don't like market stuff for you
they don't host a means for you

29
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:39,930
not not ready so then how do you explain
this

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,960
if you go to be connected to a dot com

31
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:47,509
you see the costs Inc website sake but
the fuck

32
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:51,979
what's going on a sec some shared
hosting setup or something

33
00:01:51,979 --> 00:01:55,020
so yeah you get you look into it

34
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:59,159
and you just find our shit can see this

35
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,159
hmm I hope my internet works maybe not
Yahoo see

36
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:10,879
okay let's do this quickly the
resolution is different

37
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:15,180
there was before

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,700
upon okay yet so you see it's pointing
to the same IP address

39
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:23,330
as a scan that or can also ask causing
but calm so

40
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:26,890
he connected J for whatever reason is
pointing to the same host

41
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:30,360
ice in what is it is that a bps for
dedicated system or something where does

42
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,010
the website

43
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,239
doesn't know alright but anyway so
johnson Johnson helps to a certain

44
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:37,670
extent apparently a

45
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:41,390
in our point some points on names
randomly to the causing website

46
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:44,910
so that's cool um and

47
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:48,000
this is about this is about that for a
lifetime I think

48
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,040
we can go back to slight so essentially

49
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,370
I'm this is the stuff and Kenneth miss
conflagrations and

50
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:58,300
weirdness you find when you look at the
internet you like to port scans and you

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,629
do

52
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,129
download data from all over the world
and you just look at it in bills and

53
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:03,069
database out a bit

54
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:06,319
mean you find all these kinds of
weirdness complications pointing to

55
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:06,950
stuff

56
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:09,959
of course you know you all guys know
what I'm

57
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:14,159
what I'm getting at like things like
Universal Plug & Play which is

58
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,580
vulnerable all over the place and then
you find

59
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:20,629
town at shells with default passwords
tema chose to just drop your shelves

60
00:03:20,629 --> 00:03:22,120
without even asking for password

61
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:25,409
you find serial port service that are
attached to

62
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:31,620
fuel pumps to GPS location devices and
tracking sending out GPS locations

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,970
it's attached to license plate readers
that are on the side of the road and

64
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,870
tell you who was driving by and you just
connect to them and

65
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:42,090
by a town that and they just tell you
hate this guys driving by hate this case

66
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:42,640
written by

67
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,519
so this kind of sums up the S&P you know
don't even talk about it

68
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:51,140
all kinds of embedded web interfaces
that have authentication might not have

69
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,569
have box love the place RTP you probably
have seen presentations where people

70
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,280
scan the internet and took screenshots
of every RTP

71
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:02,640
you know or I think was BNC server and
just had all kinds of

72
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,330
computers over there and so on so the
status on the Internet and it's just

73
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,269
something that some people look at

74
00:04:09,269 --> 00:04:12,810
one point in time and then they never
look back and people forget it

75
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,350
I'm after they leave the conference so
if you do internet scanning

76
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:20,590
and you look at this kinda stuff like
who did this in the past not many people

77
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:21,940
that the stuff there are

78
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:25,900
like the ipv4 senses you know kinda
ancient already

79
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,710
the FF that some SSL Observatory that
it's %uh missus investigation said

80
00:04:29,710 --> 00:04:33,020
download a bunch of certificates and the
into a fun love on abilities

81
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:36,150
but it was a one-shot in a one-shot
experiment three months

82
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,169
they were done like that was it so
nowadays

83
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:43,229
people are getting more into this showed
and their shadow server critical I O by

84
00:04:43,229 --> 00:04:43,660
some

85
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,580
random going Texas and um essentially
they're trying to

86
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,630
map out was on the Internet look at
weirdness maybe make it searchable

87
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:55,740
arm you know do some research on the
data in terms of my abilities and so on

88
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,759
so the problem is where's the data on

89
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:01,759
the FF Observatory released it internet
census

90
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:04,789
on the kinda botnet they released it so
you got like

91
00:05:04,789 --> 00:05:08,460
judgment update from the internet but
arm its one-child research

92
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:13,410
sup ongoing shipped the top more

93
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,410
I need two more minutes okay our shots

94
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:26,080
wanna talk to a nap mats alright okay

95
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,700
so um yet so the ongoing continues stuff
so showdown shadows server

96
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,960
some other guys they make pretty graphs
the report to people they are

97
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,060
you know make searchable interfaces but
this kind of thing like economic JJ

98
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:43,650
you can find that on showdown probably
so the question is

99
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:48,020
is there someone doing this kind of
research doing up scanning the internet

100
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:51,680
getting all the data and releasing it to
the public and we haven't found anyone

101
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,730
is nobody wants to share it so yeah the

102
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,880
the mission essentially scan all the
things

103
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,790
find Britain's on the Internet share the
findings raise awareness about

104
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,820
all the shit that is out there I monitor
how we improve over security

105
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,200
so do things get patched you know are
there less PNC service than they were

106
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,500
last year when some presented at Black
Hat

107
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,460
or somewhere else on and we want to
publish the data for the community

108
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:19,900
so now I'm almost done because
essentially

109
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:23,770
you can go to scans I O and I have to
thank the University of Michigan

110
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:27,670
for hosting our data and you can grab
HTPC

111
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,080
up gets less 08 HTML from all kinds of
web service all of the Internet

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:35,910
SSL Certificates DNS data and there's
more to come

113
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:39,550
we're not yet there but we're doing this
professionally as the company so we need

114
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:39,870
to

115
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:43,360
legal review and whatever so will have
more data on their

116
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,950
and its 40 love you to download and
investigate and then hopefully

117
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:50,300
you send me a message when you find
something fun alright thanks
